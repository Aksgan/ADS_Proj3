kHz, but should also satisfy other constraints to prevent [[aliasing]]. == Signal overload == {{main|Clipping (audio)}} It is very important to avoid input signal overload when using an anti-aliasing filter. If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the [[analog-to-digital converter]], even after filtering. When distortion due to clipping occurs after the anti-aliasing filter, it can create components outside the passband of the anti-aliasing filter; these components can then alias, causing the reproduction of other non-harmonically-related frequencies. In [[digital audio]], the resulting aliased distorted signal of "digital [[clipping (audio)|clipping]]" has a characteristic sound that can be easily recognized. == See also == *[[Anti-aliasing]] *[[Sample (signal)]] *[[Sampling frequency]] ==References== <references/> {{DSP}} [[Category:Digital signal processing]] [[Category:Linear filters]] [[Category:Electronic filter applications]] [[ca:Filtre Antialiàsing]] [[fr:Filtre anticrénelage]] [[it:Filtro anti-alias]] [[ro:Filtru antidedublare]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1993</id> <title>Anti-gravity</title> <text>{{redirect|AntiGrav|the EyeToy video game|EyeToy: AntiGrav}} In [[physical cosmology]], [[astronomy]] and [[celestial mechanics]], '''anti-gravity''' is the idea of creating a place or object that is free from the force of [[gravity]]. It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in [[free fall]] or [[orbit]], nor to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift. Instead, anti-gravity requires that the fundamental causes of the force of gravity be made either not present or not applicable to the place or object through some kind of technological intervention. Anti-gravity is a recurring concept in [[science fiction]], particularly in the context of [[spacecraft propulsion]]. The concept was first introduced formally as "[[Cavorite]]" in [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', and has been a favorite item of imaginary technology since that day. In the first mathematically accurate description of gravity, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means. However in the early part of the 20th century Newton's model was replaced by the more general and complete description known as [[general relativity]]. In general relativity, gravity is not a force in the traditional sense of the word, but the result of the geometry of space itself. These geometrical solutions always cause attractive "forces". Under general relativity, anti-gravity is highly unlikely, except under contrived circumstances that are regarded as unlikely or impossible. The term "anti-gravity" is also sometimes used to refer to hypothetical [[reactionless propulsion]] drives based on certain solutions to general relativity, although these do not oppose gravity as such. There are numerous newer theories that add onto general relativity or replace it outright, and some of these appear to allow anti-gravity-like solutions. However, according to the current generally accepted physical theories and according to the directions of physical research, there are no indications for anti-gravity to be possible.<ref>Peskin, M and Schroeder, D. ;''An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory'' (Westview Press, 1995) [ISBN 0-201-50397-2]</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = [[Robert M.

The side of the wheel above the substance would have no weight, while the other side would. This would cause the wheel to continually "fall" toward the side above the plate. This motion could be harnessed to produce power for free, a clear violation of the [[first law of thermodynamics]]. More generally, it follows from [[Gauss's law]] that static inverse-square fields (such as Earth's gravitational field) cannot be blocked (magnetism is static, but is inverse-cube). Under general relativity, the entire concept is something of a [[non sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur]]. In 1948 successful businessman [[Roger Babson]] (founder of [[Babson College]]) formed the [[Gravity Research Foundation]] to study ways to reduce the effects of gravity.<ref>Mooallem, J. (2007, October). A curious attraction. ''Harper's Magazine,'' '''315'''(1889), pp. 84-91.</ref> Their efforts were initially somewhat "[[crank (person)|crank]]ish", but they held occasional conferences that drew such people as [[Clarence Birdseye]] of frozen-food fame and [[Igor Sikorsky]], inventor of the helicopter. Over time the Foundation turned its attention away from trying to control gravity, to simply better understanding it. The Foundation disappeared some time after Babson's death in 1967. However, it continues to run an essay award, offering prizes of up to $5,000. As of 2007, it is still administered out of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] by George Rideout, Jr., son of the foundation's original director. Recent winners include California astrophysicist [[George F. Smoot]], who later won the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in physics]]. ====General relativity research in the 1950s==== {{Main|United States gravity control propulsion research (1955–1974)}} General relativity was introduced in the 1910s, but development of the theory was greatly slowed by a lack of suitable mathematical tools. Although it appeared that anti-gravity was outlawed under general relativity, there were a number of efforts to study potential solutions that allowed anti-gravity-type effects. It is claimed the [[US Air Force]] also ran a study effort throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s.<ref>Goldberg, J. M. (1992). US air force support of general relativity: 1956-1972. In, J.

ISBN 0-8176-3479-7</ref> Former Lieutenant Colonel [[Ansel Talbert]] wrote two series of newspaper articles claiming that most of the major aviation firms had started gravity control propulsion research in the 1950s. However there is little outside confirmation of these stories, and since they take place in the midst of the [[policy by press release]] era, it is not clear how much weight these stories should be
