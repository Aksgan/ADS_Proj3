time, the timer is reset to five minutes again.</ref> If the time period expires without the required number of stones having been played, then the player has lost on time.<ref group="nb">In other words, Canadian byoyomi is essentially a standard chess-style time control, based on ''N'' moves in a time period ''T'', imposed after a main period is used up. It is possible to decrease ''T'', or increase ''N'', as each overtime period expires; but systems with constant ''T'' and ''N'', for example 20 plays in 5 minutes, are widely used.</ref> ===Notation and recording games=== {{see also|Kifu}} Go games are recorded with a simple coordinate system. This is comparable to [[algebraic chess notation]], except that Go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn. Coordinate systems include purely numerical (4-4 point), hybrid (K3), and purely alphabetical.<ref>[http://stason.org/TULARC/games/go/5-3-Recording-Go-games.html Go FAQ]</ref> The [[Smart Game Format]] uses alphabetical coordinates internally, but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion. The Japanese word [[kifu]] is sometimes used to refer to a game record. ==Competitive play== ===Ranks and ratings=== {{main|Go ranks and ratings}} [[File:Go pros and amateurs.jpg.jpeg|thumb|Three Japanese professional Go players observe some younger amateurs as they dissect a [[life and death]] problem in the corner of the board, at the [[US Go Congress]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], 2003.]] In Go, rank indicates a player's skill in the game. Traditionally, ranks are measured using ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Nihon Kiin |title = Go. The World's Most Fascinating Game | page = 188 | year = 1973 | location=Tokyo, Japan }}</ref> a system which also has been adopted by many [[martial arts]]. More recently, mathematical rating systems similar to the [[Elo rating system]] have been introduced.<ref name=EGFRating>{{Citation | url = http://europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/EGF_rating_system.php#System | title = EGF Official Ratings | first=Ales | last = Cieply | publisher = European Go Federation (EGF)| accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> Such rating systems often provide a mechanism for converting a rating to a kyu or dan grade.<ref name=EGFRating/> Kyu grades (abbreviated ''k'') are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases, meaning 1st kyu is the strongest available kyu grade. Dan grades (abbreviated ''d'') are considered master grades, and increase from 1st dan to 7th dan. [[Shodan|First dan]] equals a [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in eastern martial arts using this system. Top players can attain a ''professional dan grade'' (abbreviated ''p''), with the very best reaching 9th dan professional. The difference among each amateur rank is one handicap stone. For the professional ranks, the difference is roughly one handicap stone for every three ranks. For example, if a 5k plays a game with a 1k, the 5k would need a handicap of four stones to even the odds. Top-level amateur players sometimes defeat professionals in tournament play.<ref name=EGFDatabase>{{Citation | url = http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/Player_Card.php?&key=12633346 | title = EGF Tournament Database | publisher = Association for Go in Italy (AGI) | accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> The rank system comprises, from the lowest to highest ranks: {| class="wikitable" !|Rank Type !|Range !|Stage |- |Double-digit ''kyu'' |30–20k |Beginner |- |Double-digit ''kyu'' |19–10k |Casual player |- |Single-digit ''kyu'' |9–1k |Intermediate/club player |- |Amateur ''dan'' |1–7d (where 8d is special title) |Expert player |- |Professional ''dan'' |1–9p (where 10p is special title) |Professionals |} ===Tournament and match rules=== {{see also|Go competitions}} Tournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play. Such rules may differ between events. Rules that influence the game include: the setting of compensation points (''[[komidashi|komi]]''), handicap strategies, and time control parameters. Rules that do not generally influence the game are: the tournament system, pairing strategies, and placement criteria. Common tournament systems used in Go include the [[Swiss system tournament#McMahon system|McMahon system]],<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.britgo.org/organisers/mcmahon.html | publisher = British Go Association | title = The McMahon system in a nutshell | accessdate = 2008-06-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080518202147/http://www.britgo.org/organisers/mcmahon.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-18}}</ref> [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss system]], [[league system]]s and the [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout system]].

To prevent this, the ko rule is sometimes extended to disallow the repetition of ''any'' previous position. This extension is called superko.<ref name="KoRules"/> ===Top players=== {{see also|Go players|Go professional}} Although the game was developed in China, the establishment of the [[Four go houses|Four Go houses]] by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] at the start of the 17th century shifted the focus of the Go world to Japan. State sponsorship, allowing players to dedicate themselves full time to study of the game, and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play. During this period,
