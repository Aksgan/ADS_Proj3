[[radiative transfer]] equation (RTE). However, the RTE is difficult to solve without introducing approximations. A common approximation summarized here is the diffusion approximation. Overall, solutions to the [[diffusion equation]] for photon transport are more computationally efficient, but less accurate than Monte Carlo simulations<ref name = Wang_BioMedBooK>{{cite book |author=LV Wang and HI Wu |title=Biomedical Optics|publisher=Wiley |year=2007|isbn=9780471743040}}</ref>. ==Definitions== [[Image:Energyflow.png|thumb|125px|right|Figure 1: Schematic of energy flow through a differential area element <math>dA</math> at position <math>\vec{r}</math> within a differential solid angle element <math>d\Omega</math>.]] The RTE can mathematically model the transfer of energy as photons move inside a tissue. The flow of radiation energy through a small area element in the radiation field can be characterized by [[radiance]] <math>L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t) (\frac{W}{m^2 sr})</math>. Radiance is defined as energy flow per unit normal area per unit [[solid angle]] per unit time. Here, <math>\vec{r}</math> denotes position, <math>\hat{s}</math> denotes unit direction vector and <math>t</math> denotes time (Figure 1). <br />Several other important physical quantities are based on the definition of radiance<ref name = Wang_BioMedBooK>{{cite book |author=L.H.

This is the vector counterpart of fluence rate pointing in the prevalent direction of energy flow. ==Radiative transfer equation== The RTE is a differential equation describing radiance <math>L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)</math>. It can be derived via [[conservation of energy]]. Briefly, the RTE states that a beam of light loses energy through divergence and [[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction]] (including both [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] away from the beam) and gains energy from light sources in the medium and scattering directed towards the beam. [[Coherence (physics)|Coherence]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and non-linearity are neglected. Optical properties such as [[refractive index]] <math>n</math>, [[absorption coefficient]] μ<sub>a</sub>, scattering coefficient μ<sub>s</sub>, and scattering anisotropy <math>g</math> are taken as time-invariant but may vary spatially. Scattering is assumed to be elastic. The RTE ([[Boltzmann equation]]) is thus written as<ref name="Wang_BioMedBooK"/>: :<math>\frac{\partial L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)/c}{\partial t} = -\hat{s}\cdot \nabla L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)-\mu_tL(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)+\mu_s\int_{4\pi}L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)P(\hat{s}'\cdot\hat{s})d\Omega' + S(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)</math> where<br /> *<math>c</math> is the speed of light in the tissue, as determined by the relative refractive index *μ<sub>t</sub><math>=</math>μ<sub>a</sub>+μ<sub>s</sub> is the extinction coefficient *<math>P(\hat{s}',\hat{s})</math> is the phase function, representing the probability of light with propagation direction <math>\hat{s}'</math> being scattered into solid angle <math>d\Omega</math> around <math>\hat{s}</math>. In most cases, the phase function depends only on the angle between the scattered <math>\hat{s}'</math> and incident <math>\hat{s}</math> directions, i.e. <math>P(\hat{s}',\hat{s})=P(\hat{s}'\cdot\hat{s})</math>. The scattering anisotropy can be expressed as <math>g=\int_{4\pi}(\hat{s}'\cdot\hat{s})P(\hat{s}'\cdot\hat{s})d\Omega</math> *<math>S(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)</math> describes the light source. ==Diffusion theory== ===Assumptions=== In the RTE, six different independent variables define the radiance at any spatial and temporal point (<math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> from <math>\vec{r}</math>, [[polar angle]] <math>\theta</math> and azimuthal angle <math>\phi</math> from <math>\hat{s}</math>, and <math>t</math>). By making appropriate assumptions about the behavior of photons in a scattering medium, the number of independent variables can be reduced. These assumptions lead to the [[Photon diffusion|diffusion theory]] (and diffusion equation) for photon transport. Two assumptions permit the application of diffusion theory to the RTE: *Relative to scattering events, there are very few absorption events. Likewise, after numerous scattering events, few absorption events will occur and the radiance will become nearly isotropic. This assumption is sometimes called directional broadening. *In a primarily scattering medium, the time for substantial current density change is much longer than the time to traverse one transport mean free path. Thus, over one transport mean free path, the fractional change in current density is much less than unity. This property is sometimes called temporal broadening. It should be noted that both of these assumptions require a high-[[albedo]] (predominantly scattering) medium<ref name="Wang_BioMedBooK"/>. ===The RTE in the diffusion approximation=== Radiance can be expanded on a basis set of [[spherical harmonics]] <math>Y</math><sub>n, m</sub>. In diffusion theory, radiance is taken to be largely isotropic, so only the isotropic and first-order anisotropic terms are used: <math>L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t) \approx\ \sum_{n=0}^{1} \sum_{m=-n}^{n}L_{n,m}(\vec{r},t)Y_{n,m}(\hat{s})</math> where <math>L</math><sub>n, m</sub> are the expansion coefficients. Radiance is expressed with 4 terms; one for n = 0 (the isotropic term) and 3 terms for n = 1 (the anisotropic terms). Using properties of spherical harmonics and the definitions of fluence rate <math>\Phi(\vec{r},t)</math> and current density <math>\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)</math>, the isotropic and anisotropic terms can respectively be expressed as follows: *<math>L_{0,0}(\vec{r},t)Y_{0,0}(\hat{s})=\frac{\Phi(\vec{r},t)}{4\pi}</math> *<math>\sum_{m=-1}^{1}L_{1,m}(\vec{r},t)Y_{1,m}(\hat{s})=\frac{3}{4\pi}\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)\cdot \hat{s}</math> Hence we can approximate radiance as<ref name = Wang_BioMedBooK>{{cite book |author= L.H. Wang and H.I. Wu |title=Biomedical Optics|publisher=Wiley |year=2007|isbn=9780471743040}}</ref> :<math>L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\Phi(\vec{r},t)+\frac{3}{4\pi}\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)\cdot \hat{s}</math> Substituting the above expression for radiance, the RTE can be respectively rewritten in scalar and vector forms as follows (The scattering term of the RTE is integrated over the complete <math>4\pi</math> solid angle. For the vector form, the RTE is multiplied by direction <math>\hat{s}</math> before evaluation.)<ref name="Wang_BioMedBooK"/>: :<math> \frac{\partial \Phi(\vec{r},t)}{c\partial t} + \mu_a\Phi(\vec{r},t) + \nabla \cdot \vec{J}(\vec{r},t) = S(\vec{r},t)</math> :<br /><math> \frac{\partial \vec{J}(\vec{r},t)}{c\partial t} + (\mu_a+\mu_s')\vec{J}(\vec{r},t) + \frac{1}{3}\nabla \Phi(\vec{r},t) = 0</math> The diffusion approximation is limited to systems where reduced scattering coefficients are much larger than their absorption coefficients and having a minimum layer thickness of the order of a few transport [[mean free path]]. ===The diffusion equation=== Using the second assumption of diffusion theory, we note that the fractional change in current density <math>\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)</math> over one transport [[mean free path]] is negligible. The vector representation of the diffusion theory RTE reduces to [[Fick's law]] <math>\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{-\nabla \Phi(\vec{r},t)}{3(\mu_a+\mu_s')}</math>, which defines current density in terms of the gradient of fluence rate. Substituting Fick's law into the scalar representation of the RTE gives the diffusion equation<ref name="Wang_BioMedBooK"/>: :<math> \frac{\partial \Phi(\vec{r},t)}{c\partial t} + \mu_a\Phi(\vec{r},t) - \nabla \cdot [D\nabla\Phi(\vec{r},t)] = S(\vec{r},t)</math> <math>D=\frac{1}{3(\mu_a+\mu_s')}</math> is the [[diffusion coefficient]] and μ'<sub>s</sub><math>=(1-g)</math>μ<sub>s</sub> is the reduced scattering coefficient. <br />Notably, there is no explicit dependence on the scattering coefficient in the diffusion equation. Instead, only the reduced scattering coefficient appears in the expression for <math>D</math>. This leads to an important relationship; diffusion is unaffected if the anisotropy of the scattering medium is changed while the reduced scattering coefficient stays constant<ref name="Wang_BioMedBooK"/>. ==Solutions to the diffusion equation== For various configurations of boundaries (e.g. layers of tissue) and light sources, the diffusion equation may be solved by applying appropriate [[boundary conditions]] and defining the source term <math>S(\vec{r},t)</math> as the situation demands. ===Point
