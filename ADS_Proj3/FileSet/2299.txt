CE version lacks Active Debugging. ===JScript .NET=== {{Main|JScript .NET}} JScript .NET is a [[Microsoft .NET]] implementation of JScript, it is a [[Common Language Specification|CLS]] language and thus inherits very powerful features, but lacks many features of the original JScript language, making it inappropriate for many scripting scenarios. JScript .NET can be used for [[ASP.NET]] pages and for complete .NET applications, but the lack of support for this language in Microsoft Visual Studio place it more as an upgrade path for classic [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] using classic JScript than as a new first-class language. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" !

Note: JScript .NET versions are not related to classic JScript versions. JScript .NET is a separate product. Even though JScript .NET is not supported within the Visual Studio IDE, its versions are in sync with other .NET languages versions (C#, VB.NET, VC++) that follows their corresponding Visual Studio versions. .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 are built on top of 2.0 and do not include newer releases of JScript .NET.

Developed by [[Phil Burk]] and others, it is distributed through Burk's company, SoftSynth. JSyn has a flexible, [[unit generator]]-based synthesis and [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] architecture that allows developers to create synthesizers, audio playback routines, and effects processing algorithms within a Java framework that allows for easy integration with other Java routines (e.g. graphics, [[user interface]], etc.). A [[plugin]] is available for [[web browser]]s to run JSyn-enabled [[applet]]s distributed over the [[world wide web]]. Although fundamentally a synthesis language (imitative of if not directly inspired by [[Csound]] and other [[MUSIC-N]] languages), JSyn has a number of powerful extensions and ancillary libraries, including JMSL (a Java update to the [[HMSL]] music specification language) and [[JScore]] (a staff notation editor and library), which adds a significantly higher level of musical [[Music informatics|informatics]] to the package than would normally be supplied with a set of synthesis routines. '''Wire''', a graphical editor for JSyn routines, also allows developers to create DSP chains using a simple [[GUI]] that gives the API some of the ease of use of programs such as [[Max/MSP]]. A commercial (though inexpensive) [[Software developer|developer]] license allows JSyn to be incorporated into commercial applications. ==External links== *[http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/ JSyn Home Page] *[http://www.algomusic.com/ JMSL Home Page] {{DEFAULTSORT:Jsyn}} [[Category:Audio programming languages]] [[Category:Audio libraries]] [[Category:Java platform]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19607</id> <title>Jack Bicer</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|wikify =December 2010|BLP unsourced =January 2010|notability =January 2010}} '''Jack Bicer''', ''Father of Uninstall''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, created the uninstall concept and wrote the first [[uninstaller]] in 1992 while working on the Norton Desktop for Windows project at Symantec.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Later, while he was at Quotron in 1993, Bicer also invented the "Automated Software Updates" concept in the pre-internet era and developed the first automatic software update/installation capability using Quotron's international data network for stock quotes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The concept was demonstrated by dropping a copy of the Microsoft Office at the main data center in New York, and installing the software on the workstations located in California without using any floppies or network drives.
