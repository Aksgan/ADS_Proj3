in Opp. to IBM's Motion for SJ on Claim of Copyright Infringement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The GPL has become an issue in ''SCO v. IBM''. Under U.S. copyright law, distribution of creative works whose copyright is owned by another party is illegal without permission from the copyright owner, usually in the form of a license; the GPL is such a license, and thus allows distribution, but only under limited conditions. Since IBM released the relevant code under the terms of the GPL, it claims that the only permission that SCO has to copy and distribute IBM's code in Linux is under the terms and conditions of the GPL, one of which requires the distributor to "accept" the GPL. IBM says that SCO violated the GPL by denouncing the GPL's validity, and by claiming that the GPL violates the U.S. Constitution, together with copyright, antitrust and export control laws. IBM also claims that SCO's SCOsource program is incompatible with the requirement that redistributions of GPLed works must be free of copyright licensing fees (fees may be charged for the acts of duplication and support). IBM has brought counterclaims alleging that SCO has violated the GPL and breached IBM's copyrights by collecting licensing fees while distributing IBM's copyrighted material.<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040331043539340 Groklaw - IBM's Second Amended Counterclaims Lists 9 Newly Registered Copyrights<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><!-- WP:WEIGHT? SCO dropped their GPL-as-unconstitutional claims anyway.--> ==Status of current lawsuits== ===''SCO v. IBM''=== {{Main|SCO v. IBM}} On March 7, 2003, SCO filed suit against [[IBM]]. Initially this lawsuit was about breach of contract and trade secrets. Later, SCO dropped the trade secrets claim, so the claim is breach of contract. SCO also added a copyright claim related to IBM's continued use of AIX, but not related to Linux. The judge subsequently stated that the SCO group had indeed made a claim of copyright infringement against IBM regarding Linux. IBM filed multiple counter claims, including charges of both patent violations, which were later dropped, and violation of copyright law. Discovery in the case is still underway. On February 8, 2005 Judge Kimball ruled that IBM's motions for summary judgment were premature but added: <blockquote>Viewed against the backdrop of SCO's plethora of public statements concerning IBM's and others' infringement of SCO's purported copyrights to the UNIX software, it is astonishing that SCO has not offered any competent evidence to create a disputed fact regarding whether IBM has infringed SCO's alleged copyrights through IBM's Linux activities.<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050209203941896 Groklaw - Kimball Memorandum and Order - as text<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote> On June 28, 2006 Judge Brooke Wells granted, in part, IBM's motion to limit SCO's claims and excluded 186 of SCO's 294 items of allegedly misused intellectual property (IBM had challenged 201 of them for various reasons).<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628175203644 Groklaw - Wells Grants in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims! In *Large* Part<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Wells cited a number of factors including SCO's inability to provide sufficient specificity in these claims: <blockquote>In December 2003, near the beginning of this case, the court ordered SCO to, "identify and state with specificity the source code(s) that SCO is claiming forms the basis of their action against IBM." Even if SCO lacked the code behind methods and concepts at this early stage, SCO could have and should have, at least articulated which methods and concepts formed "the basis of their action against IBM." At a minimum, SCO should have identified the code behind their method and concepts in the final submission pursuant to this original order entered in December 2003 and Judge Kimballâ€™s order entered in July 2005.<ref>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628203537917 (paragraph 30)</ref></blockquote> This left about 100 of SCO's items of allegedly misused intellectual property (the merits of which have not yet been judged), out of 294 items originally disclosed by SCO. Following the partial summary judgment rulings in the SCO vs Novell Slander of Title case, Judge Kimball asked<ref>http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-1077.pdf</ref> the parties in SCO v IBM to prepare by August 31, 2007 a statement of the status of this case. ===''Red Hat v. SCO''=== {{Main|Red Hat v. SCO}} [[Red Hat]] filed suit against SCO on August 4, 2003. Red Hat sued SCO for false advertising, deceptive trade practices and asked for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of any of SCO's copyrights. This case has been stayed pending resolution of the IBM case. ===''SCO v. Novell''=== {{Main|SCO v. Novell}} After SCO initiated their Linux campaign, they said that they were the owners of [[Unix|UNIX]]. [[Novell]] claimed these statements were false, and that they still owned the rights in question. After Novell registered the copyrights to some key UNIX products, SCO filed suit against Novell on January 20, 2004.<ref name="novell-0">{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-0.pdf | title=SCO's Complaint In the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County, State of Utah | date=2004-01-20}}</ref> Novell [[removal jurisdiction|removed]] the suit to federal court on February 6, 2004.<ref name="novell-1">{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-1.pdf | title=Novell's Removal Notice | date=2004-02-06 | publisher=Groklaw}}</ref> On July 29, 2005, Novell filed its answer with the court, denying SCO's claims. Novell also filed counterclaims asking the court to force SCO to turn over the revenues it had received from UNIX licenses, less a 5% administrative fee. Additionally, Novell asked the court to place the funds in a "constructive trust" in order to ensure that SCO could pay Novell since the company's assets were depleting rapidly. On August 10, 2007, Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights". Novell was awarded summary judgments on a number of claims, and a number of SCO claims were denied. SCO was instructed to account for and pass to Novell an appropriate portion of income relating to SCOSource licences to Sun Microsystems and Microsoft. A number of matters are not disposed of by Judge Kimball's ruling, and the outcome of these are still pending.<ref name="doc377" /><ref name="novell379" /> On July 16, 2008, the trial court issued an order awarding Novell $2,547,817 and ruled that SCO was
