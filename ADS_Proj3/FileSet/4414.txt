Joe Belfiore moved to [[Seattle]] to work for [[Microsoft]], taking the official "The Game" with him, although the San Francisco Bay Area people still consider their games to be "The Game." Structurally, the two Games are identical, but the Seattle Games tend to be more competitive and require more technological gear. Currently, versions of The Game (both full-blown and abbreviated foot-transportation-only) are organized regularly by Stanford dorm staff members as a bonding activity for their residents. ==Structure== The general structure of The Game is a series of puzzle challenges, often called "Clues". Each challenge solves to the location where the next challenge can be found. During the course of The Game, a team will often travel all around a metropolitan area. Usually there is an overall theme to the clues, or even a story that ties all the clues together. ==Game communities== In Seattle, the organization typically fell on the previous winner. However, as time progressed, the Seattle System became unfeasible, and a central organization was created to ensure that Games were not spaced too closely together. In the Bay Area, the next Game would be run by whatever team felt the ability, chutzpah and desire to do so. Future Game Controls (GCs) in the Bay Area tended to rely on the expertise of previous GCs and the so-called legitimacy of owning the "Captain's List". In the Bay Area there is no "Central System" or "Central Ownership" per se, but rather an autonomous collective of Gamers (a group of teams that communicate with one-another) and a group-moderated site. In subsequent years, The Game became increasingly more high-tech and more psychological in nature, a result of each Game trying to "outdo" the previous Games. For instance, a team member might find themselves stripped of all clothes and spectacles, be dressed in nothing but a hospital gown, have the next puzzle be written on the back of their neck in reverse lettering, and then be deposited at a strip club. Teams became increasingly competitive and would even break the rules and mislead other teams in order to gain an advantage, much to the fellow participants' and organizers' displeasure. Such teams can become [[wikt:blacklist|blacklist]]ed by the community at large and no longer find themselves invited to future Games. This nature of self-policing (decentralized control and word-of-mouth) prevents out-of-control teams from destroying the elaborate events. In the 2002 Game, "Shelby Logan's Run", a participant was severely injured in a mine shaft.<ref>Martin, Jonathan.

The August 2005 "Mooncurser's Handbook" Game in Seattle, run by a group of twelve veteran Seattle Gamers, renewed the Seattle Game tradition, with a special emphasis on safety. The Game culture has spawned several spinoffs in the Bay Area, including the Bay Area Treasure Hunt (BATH), Bay Area Night Game (BANG), Park Challenge, Iron Puzzler, and Different Area Same Hunt (DASH). There have been several spinoffs in other parts of North America as well. There are three yearly games in [[New York City]] that are very similar to The Game: Midnight Madness, The Haystack, and The Great All Nighter. There is also a yearly game in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], [[Arkansas]] also called Midnight Madness. Midnight Madness Brevard also puts on events many times a year in [[Brevard County, Florida]]. Midnight Madness Vermont hosts MMVT events several times a year as well. ==Specific instances and similar games== ===San Francisco Bay Area games=== * [http://lowkey.org/ghostpatrol/2008game/main-2008.htm Ghost Patrol], 2008 * [http://www.piratesbath.com/ Pirate's BATH (BATH3)], 2007 * [http://www.no-more-secrets.org/ No More Secrets], 2007 * [http://www.gotohogwarts.com/ Hogwarts and the Draconian Prophecy], 2006 * [http://www.xxtraonline.com/ Paparazzi], 2006 * [http://www.griffithscollection.org/ Griffiths Collection], 2005 * [http://www.fobik.org/JU/ Justice Unlimited], 2004 * [http://www.thegenomegame.com/ The Genome Game], 2004 * [http://www.thegooniesgame.com/ The Goonies Game], 2003 * [http://www.fobik.org/ FoBiK], 2002 * [http://www.thejackpotgame.com/ Jackpot], Las Vegas, 2002 * Zelda: A Hidden Link, 2001 * [http://web.archive.org/web/20091027025439/http://geocities.com/ftolh/ Homicide: Life on the Farm], 2001 * [http://www.the420game.com The 420 Game], 2001 * MegaHard, 2000 * Wonka, 1999 * [http://zonker.stanford.edu/~gcon/ Espionage], 1999 * [http://www.jessenyu.com/amnesia/amnesia.html Amnesia], 1999 * Dragonhunt, 1998 * The Green Game, 1997 * Star Wars, 1997 * Indiana Jones, 1996 * Godfather, 1996 * SETI, 1996 * Magic: The Gaming, 1995 * Operation: The Plague, 1995 * The Most Dangerous Game, 1994 * King Arthur, 1994 * HELL, 1994 * R.A.T.R.A.C.E. 1993 * Alice in Wonderland, 1993 * Long Ride Home, 1992 * "Circle K" Game, 1992 * Mission Improbable, 1991 ====Shorter Bay Area games (less than 24 hours)==== * [http://cluethegame.wikidot.com/ Clue: The Game], 2008 * [http://www.coedastronomy.org/sf/ SFMiniGame] (run simultaneously in Seattle), 2008 * [http://www.snout.org/hotsheet/2008/02/madness-this-is-game.html Midnight Madness: Back to Basics], 2008 * The Apprentice: Zorg, 2006 * [http://cranea.adunar.com/ CRANEA], 2005 * [http://www.t-hunts.com/BATH2/ BATH2], 2003 * [http://www.t-hunts.com/BATH1/ BATH1], 2001 * Overnightmare, 2003 * Magic 8-Ball, 2002 * [http://home.earthlink.net/~ltao/rally/intro.html Beanie Babies Rescue], 1998 * [http://www.sethoscope.net/thegame/ The Quest for Ultimate Power], 1997 ====Recurring Bay Area events (less than 24 hours)==== *[http://www.shinteki.com/ Shinteki] - 12 hour events from [http://www.justpassingthrough.tv/ Just Passing Through] *[http://www.bayareanightgame.org/ BANG] ('''B'''ay '''A'''rea '''N'''ight '''G'''ame) ===Seattle games=== * [http://www.mooncurser.info/ The Mooncurser's Handbook], Seattle, 2005 * [http://www.shelbylogansrun.com/ Shelby Logan's Run], Las Vegas, 2002 * Blau Foundation, Seattle, 2001 * VQuest, Seattle, 2000 * [http://www.miksovsky.com/Game/Articles/Seattle%20Times%20NIT2000%20Article.htm The N.
