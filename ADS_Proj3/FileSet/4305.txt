This refers to the need to keep multiple copies of a set of data coherent with one another. Examples include: * [[File synchronization]], such as syncing a hand-held MP3 player to a desktop computer. * [[Cluster file system]]s, which are [[file system]]s that maintain data or indexes in a coherent fashion across a whole [[computing cluster]]. * [[Cache coherency]], maintaining multiple copies of data in sync across multiple [[cache]]s. * [[RAID]], where data is written in a redundant fashion across multiple disks, so that the loss of any one disk does not lead to a loss of data. * [[Database replication]], where copies of data on a [[database]] are kept in sync, despite possible large geographical separation. * [[Journaling file system|Journalling]], a technique used by many modern file systems to make sure that file metadata are updated on a disk in a coherent, consistent manner. ==Mathematical foundations== An abstract mathematical foundation for synchronization primitives is given by the [[history monoid]]. There are also many higher-level theoretical devices, such as [[process calculi]] and [[Petri net]]s, which can be built on top of the history monoid. == External links == *[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-linux-synchronization.html Anatomy of Linux synchronization methods] at IBM developerWorks *[http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/ ''The Little Book of Semaphores''], by Allen B.

The theory of SynCFGs borrows from [[syntax-directed transduction]] and [[syntax-based machine translation]], modeling the reordering of clauses that occurs when translating a sentence by correspondences between phrase-structure rules in the source and target languages.

The user may then call all services and expect a reply which may be utilized generically. This architectural abstraction is made necessary due to [[Functional logic (business logic) abstraction]], which is the capability of separating business logic implementation code from the service protocol implementation calling it. The fact that business logic implementations (operations) may be implemented in Synchronous or Asynchronous manners and that these business logic implementations may be interchangeable can cause problems when not addressed. ==Source== elemenope User Guide ==See also== [[elemenope]] ==External links== *[http://elemenope.org/ elemenope home page] *[http://elemenope.org/doc/userguide/userguide-1.1.pdf elemenope User Guide] [[Category:Software architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36401</id> <title>Synchrotron light source</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=June 2008}} <!--- Remove suggested merge tag, now accomplished {{Mergeto|Synchrotron radiation|Talk:Synchrotron_radiation#Merging_Synchrotron_radiation_with_Synchrotron_light|date=May 2008}} --> :''This article is mostly concerned with the laboratory production and applications of [[synchrotron radiation]].

Once the high-energy electron beam has been generated, it is directed into auxiliary components such as [[bending magnet]]s and [[insertion device]]s ([[undulator]]s or [[wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]]s) in [[storage ring]]s and [[free electron laser]]s. These supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam which are needed to convert the high-energy electron energy into light or some other form of EM radiation. The major applications of synchrotron light are in [[condensed matter physics]], [[materials science]], [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. A large fraction of experiments using synchrotron light involve probing the structure of matter from the sub-[[nanometer]] level of [[electronic structure]] to the [[micrometre|micrometer]] and [[millimeter]] level important in [[medical imaging]]. An example of a practical industrial application is the manufacturing of microstructures by the [[LIGA]] process. ==Properties of sources== Especially when artificially produced, synchrotron radiation is notable for its: * High brightness and high intensity, many orders of magnitude more than
