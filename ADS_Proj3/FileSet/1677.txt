There is an apparent progression of concepts implied in the film's science: individual person-based memory (neural system, or possibly even whole organism), cell-based memory (genes), and atom-based memory (matter). The implied suggestion seems that memory could be present at every scale of matter, down to the very energy, innate to it—to the universal, primordial "substance" that everything in existence is made of. This way, the film advances the seminal idea behind the concept of genetic memory to a completely new level. The story is loosely based on actual research done by Dr. [[John C. Lilly]]. * [[List of Andromeda episodes|''Andromeda'' television series episode]], "The Devil Take the Hindmost" (2001), a group of genetically engineered humans possesses genetic memory. Tiama, a Hajira, forcibly extracts [[Rev Bem]]'s genetic material and uses it to infest herself with parasitic [[Magog (Andromeda)|Magog]] larvae, resulting in her death. These "Hajira-Magog" inherit the Hajira's genetic memory, retaining Tiama's memories. * ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'' (2005–2008 animated series) & ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]'' (its 2008–2010 successor), Ectonurites such as [[List of Omnitrix aliens#Ghostfreak|Ghostfreak]] have their entire consciousness present even in a few strands of DNA * ''[[Doctor Who and the Silurians]]'' (1970 ''Doctor Who'' serial), humanity is revealed to possess a racial memory of the (misnamed) [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurian]]s, humanoid reptiles who ruled Earth in prehistoric times. Since the "Silurians" treated primitive humans as at best pets and at worst vermin, the racial memory is one of abject terror, and the sight of a "Silurian" can drive a person mad. * ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'' (2002 film), the main character receives paranormal aspects of vision due to her newly transplanted eyes via a similar concept known as [[cellular memory]] * ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005 film), the main character and clone, Lincoln Six Echo, has memories of his sponsor's vehicle designs, particularly of a speedboat * ''[[Jekyll (TV series)|Jekyll]]'' (2007 TV series), 'Hyde' recalls memories from the original Doctor Jekyll. He is described by the scientist Dr. Gilligan as having race memory that works unlike that of 'normal humans' * ''[[Macross 7]]'' anime (1982–2010), the [[Zentradi]], a cloned species, are revealed to have a racial memory of the [[Protodeviln]], so terrible that they (and those of mixed human/Zentradi blood) are driven into wild rages by their close presence *Quatermass and the Pit, Human bones predating mans earliest ancestors are unearthed,they are revealed to have been created by ancient Martians fleeing Mars from a race purge, have affected mankinds evolution. * '' [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[Catspaw (TOS episode)|Catspaw]]" (1968), the idea of racial memory is central to the plot. In the [[Star Trek: Enterprise]] Episode [[Similitude (Star Trek: Enterprise)|"Similitude"]] the human clone Sim possesses genetic memory of Trip's life. * ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (1997–2007 television series) & [[Stargate: Continuum]] (its 2008 film successor), the [[Goa'uld]] alien race possess a genetic memory. In the sister series, ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', the whale species ''flagisalis'' also possess a genetic memory. * ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Aubrey (The X-Files)|Aubrey]]" (1995) deals with genetic memory. A police detective has visions of crimes committed by a rapist. It turns out she was the daughter of the offspring of one of the rapist's surviving victims and in turn was his biological granddaughter. The urge to kill the surviving woman nearly overtakes her. ==Literature== * Douglas Adams' ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a distant descendant of [[Genghis Khan]] shows attributes of his ancestor: He likes axes, and often has visions of angry men, horses, and war when he becomes angry. * Douglas Adams' novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', an ancient series of terrible wars known as the [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Krikkit|Krikkit Wars]] manage to affect most civilizations in the universe, including the one which would eventually become Earth. Vague racial memories of the events of the war lead the humans to create the sport [[cricket]], forgetting what they're basing it on. The rest of the universe, noting how shameless it is to create a sport based on such horrible events, chose to shun Earth due to its tactlessness, which is why Earth still remains uncontacted by aliens. * [[Jean M. Auel]]'s ''[[Earth's Children]]'' series, the primitive Neanderthal people who adopted and raised the Cro-Magnon main character had ancestral memories that they could draw upon at will as adults. Children were born with these ancestral memories and needed only a "reminder" to be able to recall this knowledge. This ability was necessary for communication and survival due to their undeveloped verbal abilities. These ancestral memories were important because they grasped new ideas only with great difficulty. It was far easier to recall what had already been done than to work out new ways. * ''Stories of [[Dr. Zeus Inc.]]'', by [[Kage Baker]], feature a race of small humanoids who have shared memory, apparently genetic in origin. * [[Pierre Boulle]]'s novel ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'', important exposition is given by a primitive human who has been hypnotized into revealing subconscious racial memories. * [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' incorporates genetic memory as a plot device. * [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', genetic memory is a central driving concept. A female secret society called the [[Bene Gesserit]] are
