40 (2×20) and each competitor receives 2. ===Deterrence theory=== This theory states that Player A will be able to get payoff of higher than 40. Suppose Player A finds the induction argument convincing. He will decide how many periods at the end to play such a strategy, suppose 3. In periods 1-17, he will decide to always be aggressive against the choice of IN. If all of the potential competitors know this, it is unlikely potential competitors 1-17 will bother the [[chain store]], thus risking a the safe payout of 1 ("A" will not retaliate if they choose "OUT"). If a few do test the chain store early in the game, and see that they are greeted with the aggressive strategy, the rest of the competitors are likely not to test any further. Assuming all 17 are deterred, Player A receives 91 (17×5 + 2×3). Even if 10 competitors test Player A's will, he still receives 41 (7×5 + 2×3), which is better than the induction (game theoretically correct) payoff. ===The chain store paradox=== The logical inescapability of the induction argument is unable to destroy the allure of the deterrence theory. [[Reinhard Selten]]'s response to this [[paradox]] is to argue that the idea of "deterrence", while [[irrational]] by the standards of [[Game Theory]], is in fact an acceptable idea by the rationality that individuals actually employ. Selten argues that individuals can make decisions of three levels: Routine, Imagination, and Reasoning. ==Selten's levels of decision making== ===The routine level=== The individuals use their past experience of the results of decisions to guide their response to choices in the present. "The underlying criteria of similarity between decision situations are crude and sometimes inadequate". (Selten) ===The imagination level=== The individual tries to visualise how the selection of different alternatives may influence the probable course of future events. This level employs the routine level within the procedural decisions. This method is similar to a computer simulation. ===The reasoning level=== The individual makes a conscious effort to analyse the situation in a rational way, using both past experience and logical thinking. This mode of decision uses simplified models whose assumptions are products of imagination, and is the only method of reasoning permitted and expected by game theory. ==Decision-making process== ===The predecision=== One chooses which method (routine, imagination or reasoning) to use for the problem, and this decision itself is made on the routine level. ===The final decision=== Depending on which level is selected, the individual begins the decision procedure. The individual then arrives at a (possibly different) decision for each level available (if we have chosen imagination, we would arrive at a routine decision and possible and imagination decision). Selten argues that individuals can always reach a routine decision, but perhaps not the higher levels. Once the individuals have all their levels of decision, they can decide which answer to use...the Final Decision. The final decision is made on the routine level and governs actual behaviour. ==The economy of decision effort== Decision effort is a scarce commodity, being both time consuming and mentally taxing. Reasoning is more costly than Imagination, which, in turn is more costly than Routine. The highest level activated is not always the most accurate since the individual may be able to reach a good decision on the routine level, but makes serious computational mistakes on higher levels, especially Reasoning. Selten finally argues that strategic decisions, like those made by the monopolist in the chainstore paradox, are generally made by on the level of Imagination, where deterrence is a reality, due to the complexity of Reasoning, and the great inferiority of Routine (it does not allow the individual to see herself in the other player's position). Since Imagination cannot be used to visualise more than a few stages of an extensive form game (like the Chain-store game) individuals break down games into "the beginning" and "towards the end". Here, deterrence is a reality, since it is reasonable "in the beginning", yet is not convincing "towards the end". ==See also== *[[Unexpected hanging paradox]] *[[Repeated game]] ==References== {{No footnotes|date=November 2009}} * {{cite journal |last=Selten |first=Reinhard |year=1978 |authorlink=Reinhard Selten |title=The chain store paradox |journal=[[Theory and Decision]] |volume=9 |issn=0040-5833 |issue= 2 |pages=127–159 |doi=10.1007/BF00131770 }} <references /> ==Further reading== *[http://jtp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/5 Relation of Chain Store Paradox to Constitutional Politics in Canada] [[Category:Game theory]] [[Category:Paradoxes]] [[de:Chainstore-Paradoxon]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5836</id> <title>Challenge-response authentication</title> <text>{{For|the spam-filtering technique|Challenge-response spam filtering}} {{Other uses|CRAM (disambiguation)}} {{Unreferenced|date=November 2008}} In [[computer security]], '''challenge-response authentication''' is a family of protocols in which one party presents a question ("challenge") and another party must provide a valid answer ("response") to be [[authentication|authenticated]]. The simplest example of a challenge-response protocol is [[password]] authentication, where the challenge is asking for the password and the valid response is the correct password. Clearly an adversary that can eavesdrop on a password authentication can then authenticate itself in the same way. One solution is to issue multiple passwords, each of them marked with an identifier. The verifier can pick any of the identifiers, and the prover must have the correct password for that identifier. Assuming that the passwords are chosen independently, an adversary who intercepts one challenge-response message pair has no more chance of responding correctly to a different challenge than an adversary who has intercepted nothing. For example, when other [[communications security]] methods are unavailable, the [[United States|U.S.]] military uses the [[AKAC-1553]] DRYAD numeral cipher to authenticate and encrypt some communications. DRYAD includes a list of three-letter challenge codes, which the verifier is supposed to choose randomly from, and random three-letter responses to them. For added security, each set of codes is only valid for a particular time period which is ordinarily 24 hours. Software in the 1980s and 1990s often used a similar method for [[copy protection]]: challenges would be questions like "What is the second word in the third paragraph on page 418 of the manual?". The security assumption was that copying the manual was more difficult than copying the software disk. ==Other non-cryptographic protocols== Challenge-response protocols are also used to assert
