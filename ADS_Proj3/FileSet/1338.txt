and [[Arthur Rock]]. In the early 1990s, however, Elxsi went out of business because of the general shift away from the use of mainframes in the global computer industry and the advent of the personal computer. The [[Tata Group]] kept the name [[Tata Elxsi]] but it now belongs to the Tata group of companies. The large range of hardware expansion gave the machine some success in departmental technical computing environments. The 64-bit registers and ability to do parallel adds within them gave it an unanticipated advantage in [[COBOL]] benchmarks, where it outperformed some mainframes. And the extreme independence of the CPUs (lack of cache snooping and invalidation), coupled with the ability to lock processes into register sets and later, the ability to partition the caches, gave it some success in real time applications. == Hardware == The Elxsi machine was a [[Minisupercomputer|mini-supercomputer]]: a category of computers that was larger than a [[VAX]] 11/780 and smaller than a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]. This market segment disappeared as high end microprocessor based systems became more powerful. The architecture was unusual, especially for its day. The system bus connected as many as 12 CPUs and I/O processors. Each CPU was built from 3 large boards of ECL gate arrays. Key elements of its instruction set architecture were: * 16 registers ([[64-bit]]) * [[32-bit]] linear address space (64-bit integers but 32-bit pointers) * Multiple register sets per processor, with switches among processes loaded into register sets handled by microcode * Small set of basic addressing modes * Small set of instruction lengths, length determinable from first few nibbles of instruction * No hardware cache coherence among processors * Microcoded message system to communicate among software processes and with I/O controllers and CPU microcode * No supervisor modeâ€”equivalent restrictions applied by controlling which processes held special message system communication links and which virtual address space had the memory management tables mapped into it * Two generations of CPU were sold and a third developed but never sold. All plugged into the same backplane and could be intermixed in a single system. == Software == The EMBOS OS was written entirely from scratch in a slightly extended [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. It was a multi-server architecture (like [[GNU Hurd]], but long predating that project). The UI was [[Unix]]-like, especially at the shell level, with similar concepts but different commands, syntax, etc. (e.g. "files" instead of "ls"; "find" instead of "grep"). Later, a Unix kernel was hosted on top of the lower-level servers so that EMBOS and Unix processes and users could co-exist (ENIX). [[OpenVMS|VMS]] compatibility software running on top of EMBOS was also added to ease porting of [[VAX]] applications. == Famous employees == Although Elxsi was not a financial success, many of its employees did go on to fame and fortune. *[[Ralph Merkle]] (who wrote the Elxsi [[Fortran]] [[compiler]]) later became a noted nanotechnologist. *Rob Catlin became an early employee of [[Chips and Technologies]]. *Thampy Thomas became a founder of [[NexGen]], which was later acquired by [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]. The [[NexGen]] design became the design for the [[AMD K6]] processor. *Mac McFarland was also an early NexGen employee. Mac's role in the design of the [[PDP-11]] is given in Gordon Bell's history of [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] (page 87) [http://research.microsoft.com/~gbell/Digital/Digital%20at%20work%201992.pdf] *B.

Jagadeesh became a founder of [[Exodus Communications]] took it public in 1998 and became CEO of [[NetScaler]] in Aug 2000 and successfully sold to Citrix for $325M in 2005 *[[Bob Rau]] and Arun Kumar became founders of [[Cydrome]]. Bob then worked at HP Labs and was one of the developers of the [[IA-64]] architecture.
