elements, families of sets with the property that any subset of a set in the family also belongs to the family. Any antichain determines a simplicial complex, the family of subsets of antichain members, and conversely the maximal simplices in a complex form an antichain.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}}.</ref> ==Example== For ''n'' = 2, there are six monotonic Boolean functions and six antichains of subsets of the two-element set {''x'',''y''}: *The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = false that ignores its input values and always returns false corresponds to the [[empty set|empty antichain]] Ø. *The [[logical conjunction]] ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' ∧ ''y'' corresponds to the antichain { {''x'',''y''} } containing the single set {''x'',''y''}. *The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' that ignores its second argument and returns the first argument corresponds to the antichain { {''x''} } containing the single set {''x''} *The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''y'' that ignores its first argument and returns the second argument corresponds to the antichain { {''y''} } containing the single set {''y''} *The [[logical disjunction]] ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' ∨ ''y'' corresponds to the antichain { {''x''}, {''y''} } containing the two sets {''x''} and {''y''}. *The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = true that ignores its input values and always returns true corresponds to the antichain {Ø} containing only the empty set. ==Values== The exact values of the Dedekind numbers are known for 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 8: :2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 {{OEIS|id=A000372}}. The first six of these numbers are given by {{harvtxt|Church|1940}}. ''M''(6) was calculated by {{harvtxt|Ward|1946}}, ''M''(7) was calculated by {{harvtxt|Church|1965}} and {{harvtxt|Berman|Köhler|1976}}, and ''M''(8) by {{harvtxt|Wiedemann|1991}}. If ''n'' is even, then ''M''(''n'') must also be even.<ref>{{harvtxt|Yamamoto|1953}}.</ref> The calculation of the fifth Dedekind number ''M''(5) = 7581 disproved a conjecture by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] that ''M''(''n'') is always divisible by (2''n'' &minus; 1)(2''n'' &minus; 2).<ref>{{harvtxt|Church|1940}}.</ref> ==Summation formula== {{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}} proved the following formula for the Dedekind numbers: :<math>M(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{2^{2^n}} \prod_{j=1}^{2^n-1} \prod_{i=0}^{j-1} \left(1-b_i^k b_k^k \prod_{m=0}^{\log_2 i} (1-b_m^i+b_m^i b_m^j)\right),</math> where :<math>b_i^k=\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2^i}\right\rfloor - 2\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2^{i+1}}\right\rfloor.</math> However, this formula is not helpful for computing the values of ''M''(''n'') for large ''n'' due to the large number of terms in the summation. ==Asymptotics== The [[logarithm]] of the Dedekind numbers can be estimated accurately via the bounds :<math>{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\le \log_2 M(n)\le {n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\left(1+O\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)\right).</math> Here the left inequality counts the number of antichains in which each set has exactly <math>\lfloor n/2\rfloor</math> elements, and the right inequality was proven by {{harvtxt|Kleitman|Markowsky|1975}}. {{harvtxt|Korshunov|1981}} provided the even more accurate estimates :<math>M(n) = (1+o(1)) 2^{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\exp a(n)</math> for even ''n'', and :<math>M(n) = (1+o(1)) 2^{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\exp (b(n)+c(n))</math> for odd ''n'', where :<math>a(n)={n\choose n/2-1}(2^{-n/2} + n^2 2^{-n-5} - n2^{-n-4}),</math> :<math>b(n)={n\choose (n-3)/2}(2^{-(n+3)/2} - n^2 2^{-n-6} - n2^{-n+3}),</math> and :<math>c(n)={n\choose (n-1)/2}(2^{-(n+1)/2} + n^2 2^{-n-4}).</math> The main idea behind these estimates is that, in most antichains, all the sets have sizes that are very close to ''n''/2.<ref>{{harvtxt|Zaguia|1993}}.</ref> For ''n'' = 2, 4, 6, 8 Korshunov's formula provides an estimate that is inaccurate by a factor of 9.8%, 10.2%, 4.1%, and -3.3%, respectively.<ref>{{citation|first=K.
