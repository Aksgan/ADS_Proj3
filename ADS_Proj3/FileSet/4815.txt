compatibility of the Windows 9x line of operating systems was merged with [[Windows NT]] with the release of Windows XP, which was the successor to both [[Windows 2000]] and Windows Me. ==History== {{See also|History of Microsoft Windows}} ===Windows prior to 95=== The first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released on 20 November 1985, achieved little popularity. It was originally going to be called "Interface Manager" but [[Rowland Hanson]], the head of marketing at Microsoft, convinced the company that the name ''Windows'' would be more appealing to consumers. Windows 1.0 was not a complete operating system, but rather an "operating environment" that extended [[MS-DOS]], and shared the latter's inherent flaws and problems. Microsoft Windows version 2 came out on 9 December 1987, and used the [[real mode|real-mode]] [[computer storage|memory]] model, which confined it to a maximum of 1 [[megabyte]] of memory. In such a configuration, it could run under another multitasker like [[DESQview]], which used the [[Intel 80286|286]] [[protected mode|Protected Mode]]. Microsoft Windows scored a significant success with Windows 3.0, released in 1990. In addition to improved capabilities given to native applications, Windows also allowed users to better [[Computer multitasking|multitask]] older MS-DOS based software compared to Windows/386, thanks to the introduction of [[virtual memory]]. Microsoft developed [[Windows 3.1x#Windows 3.1|Windows 3.1]], which included several minor improvements to Windows 3.0, but primarily consisted of bugfixes and multimedia support. It also excluded support for Real mode, and only ran on an [[80286]] or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992. Meanwhile Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was [[Dave Cutler]], one of the chief architects of [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (later purchased by [[Compaq]], now part of [[Hewlett-Packard]]).<ref name="ntvmsrussinovich">{{cite web |url=http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1990s/98/12_b.htm |title=Windows NT and VMS: The Rest of the Story |last=Russinovich |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Russinovich |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2008-12-16 }}</ref> Microsoft hired him in August 1988 to create a successor to [[OS/2]], but Cutler created a completely new system instead. Microsoft announced at the conference its intentions to develop a successor to both Windows NT and Windows 3.1's replacement ([[Windows 95]], code-named Chicago), which would unify the two into one operating system. This successor was codenamed [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo]]. In hindsight, Cairo was a much more difficult project than Microsoft had anticipated and, as a result, NT and Chicago would not be unified until [[Windows XP]]. ===Windows 95=== {{main|Windows 95}} [[Image:Windows 95 logo.svg|thumb|left|Windows 95 Logo]] After [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.11]], Microsoft began to develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system code-named Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit preemptive multitasking like OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 [[Application programming interface|API]] first introduced with Windows NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 compatibility being preserved through a technique known as "[[thunking]]". A new GUI was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release (notably Plug and Play) slipped. Microsoft did not change all of the Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it remained 16-bit (albeit not directly using [[real mode]]) for reasons of compatibility, performance and development time. Additionally it was necessary to carry over design decisions from earlier versions of Windows for reasons of backwards compatibility, even if these design decisions no longer matched a more modern computing environment. These factors eventually began to impact the operating system's efficiency and stability. Microsoft marketing adopted [[Windows 95]] as the product name for Chicago when it was released on August 24, 1995. Microsoft went on to release five different versions of Windows 95: * Windows 95 - original release * Windows 95 A - included Windows 95 [[OEM_Service_Release_2#Editions|OSR]]1 [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstreamed]] into the installation. * Windows 95 B - (OSR2) included several major enhancements, [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) 3.0 and full [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] file system support. * Windows 95 B USB - (OSR2.1) included basic [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] support. * Windows 95 C - (OSR2.5) included all the above features, plus IE 4.0. This was the last 95 version produced. OSR2, OSR2.1 and OSR2.5 were not released to the general public; rather, they were available only to [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]] that would preload the OS onto computers. Some companies sold new hard drives with OSR2 preinstalled (officially justifying this as needed due to the hard drive's capacity). The first [[Microsoft Plus!]] add-on pack was sold for Windows 95. ===Windows 98=== {{main|Windows 98}} [[Image:Windows 98 logo.svg|thumb|left|Windows 98 logo]] On 25 June 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98. It included new hardware drivers and better support for the [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] file system which allows support for disk partitions larger than the 2 GB maximum accepted by Windows 95. The [[USB]] support in Windows 98 is more robust than the basic support provided by the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] editions of Windows 95.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/247969 Windows 95 OSR2.x Support for External USB Hubs]</ref> It also controversially integrated the [[Internet Explorer]] browser into the Windows GUI and Windows Explorer file manager. In 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, an interim release whose notables features were the addition of [[Internet Connection Sharing]] and improved WDM audio and modem support. Internet Connection Sharing is a form of [[network address translation]], allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single [[Internet connection]]. Windows 98 Second Edition has [[Windows 98#Windows 98 Second Edition|certain improvements]] over the original release. Hardware support through device drivers was increased. Many minor problems present in the original Windows 98 were found and fixed which make it, according to many, the most stable release of Windows 9x familyâ€”to the extent that commentators used to say that Windows 98's [[beta version]] was more stable than Windows 95's final (gamma) version.<ref>[http://aroundcny.com/Technofile/texts/tec032998.html Windows 98: Stable and fast, as well as 'new and improved']</ref>
