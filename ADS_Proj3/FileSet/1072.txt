for systems deployment and operation. New technologies and practices were designed to handle the scale and the operational requirements of such large-scale operations. These practices eventually migrated toward the private data centers, and were adopted largely because of their practical results. {{As of|2007}}, data center design, construction, and operation is a well-known discipline. Standard Documents from accredited professional groups, such as the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]], specify the requirements for data center design. Well-known operational metrics for data center availability can be used to evaluate the business impact of a disruption. There is still a lot of development being done in operation practice, and also in environmentally-friendly data center design. Data centers are typically very expensive to build and maintain. For instance, Amazon.com's new {{convert|116000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} data center in Oregon is expected to cost up to $100 million.<ref>[http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/11/07/amazon-building-large-data-center-in-oregon/ Amazon Building Large Data Center in Oregon « Data Center Knowledge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Requirements for modern data centers== [[Image:Datacenter-telecom.jpg|thumb|left|Racks of telecommunications equipment in part of a data center.]] IT operations are a crucial aspect of most organizational operations. One of the main concerns is '''business continuity'''; companies rely on their information systems to run their operations. If a system becomes unavailable, company operations may be impaired or stopped completely. It is necessary to provide a reliable infrastructure for IT operations, in order to minimize any chance of disruption. Information security is also a concern, and for this reason a data center has to offer a secure environment which minimizes the chances of a security breach. A data center must therefore keep high standards for assuring the integrity and functionality of its hosted computer environment. This is accomplished through redundancy of both fiber optic cables and power, which includes emergency backup power generation. Telcordia [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&DOCUMENT=GR-3160& GR-3160, ''NEBS Requirements for Telecommunications Data Center Equipment and Spaces''], provides guidelines for data center spaces within telecommunications networks, and environmental requirements for the equipment intended for installation in those spaces. These criteria were developed jointly by Telcordia and industry representatives. They may be applied to data center spaces housing data processing or Information Technology (IT) equipment. The equipment may be used to: *Operate and manage a carrier’s telecommunication network *Provide data center based applications directly to the carrier’s customers *Provide hosted applications for a third party to provide services to their customers *Provide a combination of these and similar data center applications. Effective data center operation requires a balanced investment in both the facility and the housed equipment. The first step is to establish a baseline facility environment suitable for equipment installation. Standardization and modularity can yield savings and efficiencies in the design and construction of telecommunications data centers. Standardization means integrated building and equipment engineering. Modularity has the benefits of scalability and easier growth, even when planning forecasts are less than optimal. For these reasons, telecommunications data centers should be planned in repetitive building blocks of equipment, and associated power and support (conditioning) equipment when practical. The use of dedicated centralized systems requires more accurate forecasts of future needs to prevent expensive over construction, or perhaps worse — under construction that fails to meet future needs. ==Data center classification== The [http://www.adc.com/Attachment/1270711929361/102264AE.pdf ''TIA-942:Data Center Standards Overview''] describes the requirements for the data center infrastructure. The simplest is a Tier 1 data center, which is basically a [[server room]], following basic guidelines for the installation of computer systems. The most stringent level is a Tier 4 data center, which is designed to host mission critical computer systems, with fully redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones controlled by [[biometric]] access controls methods. Another consideration is the placement of the data center in a subterranean context, for data security as well as environmental considerations such as cooling requirements.<ref>A ConnectKentucky article mentioning Stone Mountain Data Center Complex {{cite web|title=Global Data Corp. to Use Old Mine for Ultra-Secure Data Storage Facility|url=http://connectkentucky.org/_documents/connected_fall_FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=ConnectKentucky|accessdate=2007-11-01|date=2007-11-01}}</ref> The four levels are defined, and copyrighted, by the [[Uptime Institute]], a [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]-based think tank and professional services organization.

Most of the equipment is often in the form of servers mounted in [[19 inch rack]] cabinets, which are usually placed in single rows forming corridors (so-called aisles) between them. This allows people access to the front and rear of each cabinet. Servers differ greatly in size from [[Rack unit|1U server]]s to large freestanding storage silos which occupy many tiles on the floor. Some equipment such as [[mainframe computer]]s and [[computer storage|storage]] devices are often as big as the racks themselves, and are placed alongside them.
