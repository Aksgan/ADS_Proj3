single sinusoid is a special case of [[least-squares spectral analysis]]. ==Good starting value for ''C''== A good starting value for ''C'' can be obtained by calculating the [[mean]] of the data. If the data show a [[trend estimation|trend]], i.e., the assumption of constant location is violated, one can replace ''C'' with a linear or quadratic [[least squares]] fit. That is, the model becomes :<math>Y_i = (B_0 + B_1T_i) + \alpha\sin(2\pi\omega T_i + \phi) + E_i </math> or :<math>Y_i = (B_0 + B_1T_i+B_2T_i^2) + \alpha\sin(2\pi\omega T_i + \phi) + E_i </math> ==Good starting value for frequency== The starting value for the frequency can be obtained from the dominant frequency in a [[periodogram]]. A [[complex demodulation]] phase plot can be used to refine this initial estimate for the frequency.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} ==Good starting values for amplitude== A complex demodulation amplitude plot can be used to find a good starting value for the amplitude. In addition, this plot can indicate whether or not the amplitude is constant over the entire range of the data or if it varies. If the plot is essentially flat, i.e., zero slope, then it is reasonable to assume a constant amplitude in the non-linear model. However, if the slope varies over the range of the plot, one may need to adjust the model to be: :<math>Y_i = C + (B_0 + B_1 T_i)\sin(2\pi\omega T_i + \phi) + E_i</math> That is, one may replace Î± with a function of time. A linear fit is specified in the model above, but this can be replaced with a more elaborate function if needed. ==Model validation== As with any [[statistical model]], the fit should be subjected to graphical and quantitative techniques of [[model validation]]. For example, a [[run sequence plot]] to check for significant shifts in location, scale, [[start-up effect]]s, and [[outliers]]. A [[lag plot]] can be used to verify the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] are independent. The outliers also appear in the lag plot, and a [[histogram]] and [[normal probability plot]] to check for skewness or other non-[[normal distribution|normality]] in the residuals. ==External links== *[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda425.htm Beam deflection case study] ==References== {{NIST-PD}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Sinusoidal Model}} [[Category:Regression analysis]] [[Category:Time series models]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34558</id> <title>Siri (Software)</title> <text>{{unref|date=January 2011}} '''Siri''' Assistant is a personal assistant app for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]].
