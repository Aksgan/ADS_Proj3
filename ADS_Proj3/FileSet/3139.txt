The project homepage is hosted by the Unidata program at the [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] (UCAR). They are also the chief source of netCDF software, standards development, updates etc. The format is an [[open standard]]. The project is actively supported by UCAR. The recently released (2008) version 4.0 greatly enhances the data model by allowing the use of the [[HDF5]] data file format. Version 4.1 adds support for C and Fortran client access to specified subsets of remote data via [[OPeNDAP]]. The format was originally based on the conceptual model of the [[NASA]] [[Common Data Format|CDF]] but has since diverged and is not compatible with it. ==Format description== The netCDF libraries support 3 different binary formats for netCDF files: * The classic format was used in the first netCDF release, and is still the default format for file creation. * The 64-bit offset format was introduced in version 3.6.0, and it supports larger variable and file sizes. * The netCDF-4/HDF5 format was introduced in version 4.0; it is the HDF5 data format, with some restrictions. All formats are "[[Metadata|self-describing]]". This means that there is a [[header (information technology)|header]] which describes the layout of the rest of the file, in particular the data [[array]]s, as well as arbitrary file metadata in the form of name/value [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]]. The format is [[platform independent]], with issues such as [[endianness]] being addressed in the [[software libraries]]. The data are stored in a fashion that allows efficient subsetting. Starting with version 4.0 of the netCDF API<ref>[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/ Version 4.0 of the netCDF API]</ref> allows the use of the [[HDF5]] data format. NetCDF users can create HDF5 files with benefits not available with the netCDF format, such as much larger files and multiple unlimited dimensions.
