[[Joseph Schumpeter]] called vividly "[[creative destruction]]". From a different perspective, [[Irving E. Fang]] (1997) identified six 'Information Revolutions': writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the 'tool shed' (which we call 'home' now), and the Information Highway. In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media. ==Measuring and modeling the Information Revolution== Porat (1976) measured the Information Sector in the US using the [[input-output analysis]]; [[OECD]] has included statistics on the Information Sector in the economic reports of its member countries. [[Image:IR.jpg|thumb|Modeling the Informational Revolution. <br />Source: Veneris (1984)]] Veneris (1984, 1990) explored the theoretical, economic and regional aspects of the Informational Revolution and developed a [[systems dynamics]] [[simulation]] [[computer model]]. These works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of [[Fritz Machlup]] who in his (1962) book "The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States", claimed that the "knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product", which he saw as evidence that the Information Age has begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained. ==See also== * [[Business cycle]] * [[Global Village (Internet)]] * [[Infollution]] * [[Information Age]] * [[Information society]] * [[International Innovation Index]] * [[Kondratiev wave]] * [[Post-Fordism]] * [[Post-industrial society]] * [[Timeline of computing 1990-forward]] * [[White-collar worker]] *[[Digital transformation]] *[[Digital Dark Ages]] == References == * [[J.

A bank's management system, for example, is considered a silo if it cannot exchange information with other related systems within its own organization, or with the management systems of its customers, vendors, or business partners. "Information silo" is a [[pejorative]] expression that is useful for describing the absence of operational reciprocity. Derived variants are "silo thinking", "silo vision", and "silo mentality". The expression is typically applied to management systems where the focus is inward and information communication is vertical. Critics of silos contend that managers serve as information gatekeepers, making timely coordination and communication among departments difficult to achieve, and seamless interoperability with external parties impractical. They hold that silos tend to limit productivity in practically all organizations, provide greater opportunity for security lapses and privacy breaches, and frustrate consumers who increasingly expect information to be immediately available and complete. Although much has been written about them, information silos are becoming far more recognized as the major reason why organizations are unable to take full advantage of the [[Internet]]'s power to interconnect business processes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} == Silo effect == {{As of | 2010}} the phrase "silo effect", popular in the [[business community | business]] and [[organizational community | organizational communities]], refers to a lack of [[organizational communication|communication]] and common [[goal (management)|goals]] between [[Departmentalization|departments]] in an [[organization]]. It is the opposite of [[systems thinking]] in an organization. The silo effect gets its name from the [[farm]] [[storage silo]]; each silo is designated for one specific grain. A lack of communication causes departmental thinking to lack ideas from other departments. A notable example of the silo effect in the real world is the [[beer distribution game]], whose goal is to meet customer demand for cases of beer, through a multi-stage supply chain with minimal expenditure on back orders and inventory. Communication is
