It is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another. '''Marshalling''' is a process that is used to communicate to remote objects with an object (in this case a [[serialization|serialized object]]). It simplifies complex communication, using custom/complex objects to communicate - instead of '''primitives'''. The opposite, or reverse, of marshalling is called ''unmarshalling'' (or ''demarshalling'', similar to ''deserialization''). == Usage == Marshalling is used within implementations of different [[Remote Procedure Call|RPC]] mechanisms, where it is necessary for transporting data between [[Process (computing)|processes]] and/or between [[Thread (computer science)|threads]]. In [[Component Object Model|Microsoft's COM]], interface pointers must be marshalled when crossing COM apartment boundaries<ref>[http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/handouts/CSE775/presentations/apartments.ppt Apartments and COM Threading Models]</ref>. In the [[.NET Framework]], the conversion between an unmanaged type and a [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] type, as in the [[Platform Invocation Services|P/Invoke]] process, is also an example of an action that requires marshalling to take place<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/eaw10et3(VS.71).aspx Interop Marshaling Overview]</ref>. Additionally, marshalling is used extensively within scripts and applications that utilize the [[XPCOM]] technologies provided within the [[Mozilla application framework|Mozilla Application Framework]]. The [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser is a popular application built with this framework that additionally allows [[scripting language]]s to utilize [[XPCOM]] through [[XPConnect|Cross-Platform Connect]] (XPConnect). == Comparison with serialization == The term "marshal" is considered to be synonymous with "serialize" in the Python standard library<ref>[http://docs.python.org/library/marshal.html Marshal Python module]</ref>, but the terms are not synonymous in the Java-related RFC 2713: <blockquote> To "marshal" an object means to record its state and [[codebase]](s) in such a way that when the marshalled object is "unmarshalled", a copy of the original object is obtained, possibly by automatically loading the class definitions of the object. You can marshal any object that is serializable or remote. Marshalling is like serialization, except marshalling also records [[codebase]]s. Marshalling is different from serialization in that marshalling treats remote objects specially. (RFC 2713)</blockquote> To "serialize" an object means to convert its state into a byte stream in such a way that the byte stream can be converted back into a copy of the object. == References == <references/> == See also == * Microsoft's [[Component Object Model]] (COM) * [[CORBA|Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)]] [[Category:Persistence]] [[Category:Remote procedure call]] [[de:Marshalling]] [[pl:Marshalling (informatyka)]] [[ru:Маршалинг]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23574</id> <title>Martin Demaine</title> <text>'''Martin L.
