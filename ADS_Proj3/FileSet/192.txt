time. In fact, operating systems with modern filesystem data integrity checking are actually more capable of surviving this. * '''Responsiveness:''' Optimized to '''respond to user actions''' in an instant. A fully pre-emptive multitasking scheduler ensures that important tasks will get a fair share of processing time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ===Appearance=== [[File:AmiagOS 4 screen drag.png|right|thumb|Workbench screen in front, web browser screen behind.]] * '''Screens:''' You can have as many different screens as you like for any purpose, each with its own application on it. Or you can open a "public screen" which several applications can share. Switching between different screens takes an instant, and you can come back to an application and find it exactly how you left it. It is even possible to drag the current screen down to reveal another screen behind it (even with a different screen resolution), so that you can view two screens simultaneously, or even drag and drop files and other content from one screen to another.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 19, 2007 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSA-q1qniMY |title=YouTube video Amiga OS4 Intuition |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> * '''Customisable [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]:''' Allows replacement of window gadgets with new designs, application of [[gradient]]s or [[texture (computer graphics)|textures]] of your choice to virtually every graphical element in the interface. It is possible to alter the geometry of the window drawing to suit personal taste, change font usage throughout the interface, configure the appearance of menus and chose own 3D effects. Having a different look for each public screen is also feasible. * '''Menuing:''' The menu bar appears at the top of the screen when pressed down the right mouse button, and disappears when it is not needed, thus reducing screen clutter and giving more room to work. ===File handling=== * '''Clear file structure:''' Operating system files are divided up into clearly labelled drawers (folders) so you know exactly where to find whatever you're looking for. For example, all libraries are stored in "Libs:" standard virtual device and absolute path finder for "Libs" directory, Fonts are all in "Fonts:" absolute locator, the files for language localization are all stored in "Locale:" and so on. * '''[[RAM disk]]:''' Like a virtual hard drive, it acts like any other disk, and stores files and data in memory rather than on your actual hard drive. The RAM disk is dynamically resizable and takes up only as much of your memory as it needs to. It can be used as a temporary store for your own purposes or as a place for software installers to put temporary files, and is cleared out at reboot so you won't be cluttering up your computer with thousands of unnecessary files that bog down your system. Additionally there is an optional '''RAD disk''', a recoverable version of the RAM disk, which preserves contents after a reboot.<ref>[http://www.amigaos4.com/index.php%3Foption=content&task=view&id=8&Itemid=.html Feature Spotlight: The RAM Disk.]</ref> * '''Datatypes:''' Recognises and '''handles file types''': displaying a picture, playing a music file, decoding a video file, rendering a web page etc. Any application can access Datatypes transparently, and thus have the ability to use any file that you have a Datatype for. * '''Icon handling:''' A file can have a default icon representing the type of file or a custom icon specific to the individual file. Additionally icons can store extra commands and [[metadata]] about the associated file â€” which program to open it in, for example. * '''Assigning devices:''' Instead of assigning drives (devices) a letter or fixed label, each drive can be given a name. Drives can be given more than one name so the system always knows where things are, if it is the system boot drive it is also known as "Sys:". Areas of hard drive can be assigned a label as if they were a virtual disk. For example, it is possible to mount MP3 players as "MP3:" and external networked resources as logical devices. ===Other=== [[File:AmigaOS 4.1 Update 1 Live CD.png|thumb|right|Booted from AmigaOS 4.1 Update 1 Live CD.]] * '''Live CD:''' The OS4 installation CD can be used as a [[Live CD]]. * '''Dockies:''' It is a fully configurable docking bar for icons, allowing quick access to most used applications. These dock bar icons, "Dockies", are fully dynamic, which means they can show real-time content and act as useful micro tools. A Docky might act as a magnifying glass, display the time, or show you the latest weather forecast or stock market information direct from the Internet. * '''Scripting:''' Implemented scripting as a fundamental feature. Using the [[AREXX]] scripting language and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] it is possible to automate, integrate and remote control almost every application and function of the computer. Function sets and tools from several applications can be brought together into a single, integrated interface to allow the most complex jobs to be performed with the utmost simplicity. [[File:Amiga-grim1.png|thumb|right|A visit from the Grim Reaper.]] * '''[[Guru Meditation|The Grim Reaper]]:''' The "[[Guru Meditation]]" is replaced by "The Grim Reaper", a crash handling system that catches crashes and lock ups, and stops them from getting out of control. It can provide complete information about the crash and can simply kill the offending task and free up the resources it was using. * '''AmiUpdate:''' Is an updating system designed purely for the latest incarnation of the AmigaOS 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiupdate.net/ |title=AmigaOS 4 updating system |publisher=Amiupdate.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> It is capable to update OS files and also all Amiga programs which are registered to use the same update program that is standard for Amiga. Updating AmigaOS requires only few libraries to be put in standard OS location "Libs:", "Fonts:" etc. This leaves Amiga users with a minimal knowledge of the system almost free to perform by hand the update of the system files. ==Compatible hardware== {{See also|Amiga models and variants}} ===Amiga=== Released (only version 4.0) for Amigas: * [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Blizzard PPC|Blizzard PPC]] equipped [[Amiga 1200]] * [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Blizzard 2604e|Blizzard 2604e]] (rare) equipped [[Amiga 2000]] * [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]] equipped [[Amiga 3000]] or [[Amiga 4000]] ===AmigaOne=== Released for [[AmigaOne]] motherboards: * AmigaOne-SE (A1-SE) * AmigaOne-XE (A1-XE) * Micro-AmigaOne
