As a tool for clinical geneticists, cytogeneticists and [[molecular biologist]]s, DECIPHER is used to determine whether gene [[copy number variation]]s identified in patients are of clinical significance. Members can visualise the genes within the region of DNA altered in their patients, and ascertain whether any are known to be implicated in disease.<ref name=Clinicians>{{cite web |url= https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/pdfs/DecipherCliniciansResearchersLeaflet.pdf |title=DECIPHER: A molecular cytogenetic database for clinicians and researchers linking genomic microarray data with phenotype using the Ensembl genome browser |author= Firth, HV|date= 23 August 2007 |work= |publisher= Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute |accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Chromosomal imbalances are a major cause of developmental delay, learning disabilities and congential abnormalities and — according to Emily Niemitz writing in ''[[Nature Genetics]]'' — the database facilitates collaboration between researchers and clinicians who have patients with similar clinical characteristics, which can "assist in the discovery of new syndromes and in the recognition of genes of clinical importance."<ref name=Policy/><ref name=Niemitz/> ==Process== Patients are entered into DECIPHER by registered consortium members. Typically a clinical geneticist arranges for a chromosome analysis (usually [[microarray]] based) of a patient's DNA. A potential microdeletion/microduplication may be identified, but the medical significance is not known.<ref name="flow">{{cite web |url= https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/pdfs/DecipherDatabaseFlowchart.pdf |title=Data Flow Chart for the DECIPHER Database |author= Firth, HV|date= |work= |publisher= Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> The clinician may enter the anonymised data into the restricted, password protected DECIPHER database and map the location and size of the chromosomal deletion/duplication to the [[reference genome]]. Using DECIPHER, the clinician can then identify the specific genes affected by the deletion/duplication, determine whether any have known clinical significance (for example, whether [[tumour suppressor genes]] have been deleted),<ref>Genes of established clinical significance, including those listed in [[OMIM]], are highlighted as are [[imprinted gene]]s.</ref> and view the region in the Ensembl genome browser to see whether there are any other consented patients in DECIPHER with overlapping deletion/duplications.<ref name=Clinicians/><ref name="flow"/> This enables a better ascertainment of whether a copy number change is a normal [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] variant, or the likely cause of the patient’s [[clinical symptom]]s.<ref name=Clinicians/> The clinician can then counsel the patient on the likely significance of the deletion/duplication, and its implications for their health.<ref name="flow"/> Each patient's data is anonymized, and represented only by an ID with an associated [[genotype]] and set of clinical symptoms ([[phenotype]]s). Patient data is made accessible to other members of the consortium and viewable through Ensembl if a [[Informed consent|consent]] form is signed by the patient.<ref name="flow"/> With informed consent, the anonymized deletion/duplication and phenotypes become available for view to DECIPHER consortium members and public users, with different levels of access (e.g. only logged users can see the contact details of the centre that entered the data). Public users who wish to find more information about a patient may send a request to DECIPHER, which then will forward it to the clinician coordinator responsible for the submitting center. Most patients deposited in DECIPHER display genetic mutations with a very low occurrence in the general population. Hence the probability of the same clinicians encountering similar patients are also low. Since DECIPHER is opened to any accredited clinician or cytogeneticist from around the world, the chances of finding similar rare cases are significantly increased. This on-line sharing of clinical genetic information not only promotes better understanding of microdeletions/microduplications and their associated pathogenic phenotypes, it has also facilitated the discovery of new [[syndrome]]s.<ref name=synd1>{{cite journal |author=Shaw-Smith C, Redon R, Rickman L, ''et al.'' |title=Microarray based comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) detects submicroscopic chromosomal deletions and duplications in patients with learning disability/mental retardation and dysmorphic features |journal=J.
