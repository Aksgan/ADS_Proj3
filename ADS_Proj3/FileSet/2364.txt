In its most basic form, "vanilla siteswap", it is very easy to use, as each pattern is reduced to a simple sequence of digits, such as "3", "97531" or "744". However, vanilla siteswap can notate only the most basic two-handed patterns. For more slightly more complicated patterns, extra rules and syntax are added to create the following two siteswap extensions: *''Synchronous Siteswap'', or "Synch" Siteswap. This is used to notate patterns where both hands throw at the same time, rather than alternating left and right hands. *''Multiplex Siteswap''. "Multiplex", in the world of juggling, means "more than one ball is in the hand at the time of the throw". Multiplex Siteswap allows you to notate such patterns, and also can be mixed with synchronous siteswap. Vanilla, synch, and multiplex siteswap are the "standard" forms of siteswap. Not only are they understood by jugglers, there are also many computer programs capable of animating juggling patterns entered in siteswap notation. Other extensions to siteswap have been developed for specific purposes. These are far less common than the "standard" forms of siteswap, understood by far fewer jugglers and only specialized software. *'''Passing siteswap''' - used for simple passing patterns. *'''Multi-Hand Notation''' (MHN) - Developed by Ed Carstens for use with his juggling program JugglePro, MHN can describe patterns with any number of hands and at any rhythm, but use is limited due to its being as complex as a computer programming language. *'''Generalized Siteswap''' (GS) - Developed by Ben Beever, GS places siteswap into a matrix that uses optional, additional rows to describe any desired attributes of the throws or catches within a pattern, such as timing issues (e.g. for synch patterns), number of spins (e.g. for clubs) and hand position/orientation (e.g. for backcrosses, claw catches etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jugglingdb.com/compendium/geek/notation/siteswap/bensguide.html?page=3|title=SS Ben's Guide to Juggling Patterns|last=Beever|first=Ben|date=20 January 2002|work=The Internet Juggling Database|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> ===Beatmap=== '''Beatmap''' is a new juggling notation system, developed in 2004 by [[Luke Burrage]].<ref>[http://jugglewiki.org/wiki/Beatmap_Notation Beatmap Notation - JuggleWiki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While there are some similarities between beatmap and synch siteswap, there are also fundamental differences. The most important is that beatmap notates every "hand" on every beat during a pattern, unlike all forms of siteswap, which only notate each hand on every other beat. This means that beatmap can notate any number of hands and in any rhythm with no added complexity, unlike siteswap, which needs many extended sets of rules and syntax to be able to communicate the same patterns. Beatmap notates not only each throw, but also the time and place of each catch. By including a simple indication of crossing and uncrossing arms, beatmap can notate [[Mills Mess]]&ndash;style patterns. Within beatmap it is also possible and easy to notate not only the balls in a pattern, but also the hands or arms of the juggler, as well as the position, location or orientation of the body of a juggler. Users claim that beatmap can more accurately describe more patterns than all ladder diagrams, causal diagrams, Mills Mess state transition diagrams, vanilla siteswap, synch siteswap, passing siteswap, and multi-hand notation combined. So far use of beatmap has been very limited, as most jugglers and juggling software understand only variations of siteswap. ==Footnotes== {{Refs}} ==External links== *[http://www.jugglingdb.com/compendium/geek/notation/ Juggling notation] entry at The Internet Juggling Database *{{dmoz|Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus/Juggling/Notation_and_Theory/}} *[http://www2.bc.edu/~lewbel/BostonGlobeJugglingArticle/BostonGlobeJugglingArticleGraphic1.htm Juggling notation] interactive graphic at [[Boston.com]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Juggling Notation}} [[Category:Notation]] [[Category:Toss juggling]] [[fr:Notation en jonglerie]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20265</id> <title>July Systems</title> <text>{{Infobox_Company | company_name = July Systems | company_logo = [[Image:July New logo.jpg|center|171px]] | company_type = Private | foundation = [[2001]] | location = [[Los Angeles, California]]<br /> Offices in [[New York, NY]], [[United States|USA]] and [[Bangalore]], [[India]] | industry = [[Mobile media]], [[Mobile Internet]], [[Mobile 2.0]] | products = Mi Platform - Publishing & Distribution, Personalization & User Management, Ad Management | homepage = [http://www.julysystems.com/ www.julysystems.com] }} '''July Systems,'''a mobile media company, was co-founded in 2001<ref name = "bw"> {{cite journal | title =July Systems, Inc. | journal =Business Week | url =http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1997546 }} </ref> by the technology entrepreneur Rajesh TS Reddy<ref name = "Forbes"> {{cite journal | title =There's Something About Rajesh | journal =Forbes Magazine, July 2009 | url =http://business.in.com/article/work-in-progress/theres-something-about-rajesh/2372/1 }} </ref>.
