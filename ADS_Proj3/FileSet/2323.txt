Hullot''' (born February 16, 1954) is a French [[computer scientist]] and [[programmer]] who authored important programs for the original [[Macintosh]], [[NeXTSTEP]] and [[Mac OS X]] platforms. These include the SOS Interface for the Mac,<ref>[http://rixstep.com/2/0/people/ The Nextonian]</ref> which later became [[Interface Builder]] for NeXTSTEP (1985),<ref>[http://www.mac-guild.org/wwdc/wwdc03.html WWDC 2003 notes]</ref> and later still evolved into an important part of Mac OS X. He also led the [[iCal]] and [[iSync]] development teams for Mac OS X (2002).<ref>[http://www.appleinsider.com/print.php?id=3316 AppleInsider, 17 October 2007]</ref> In 1981, Jean-Marie Hullot received a Ph.D. in computer science from the [[Paris-Sud 11 University|University of Paris at Orsay]],<ref>http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-286207-3.pdf</ref> where his adviser was [[Gérard Huet]]. He was a researcher at [[INRIA]] from 1979 to 1985, when he joined [[NeXT]]. In 1996 he co-founded [[RealNames]], a URL translation service which closed in 2002. He worked as CTO of Application Division at [[Apple Inc.]] from 2001 to 2005. Currently, he is the President and CEO of [[Fotopedia]], a collaborative photo encyclopaedia. ==See also== * [[Fotopedia]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.fotopedia.com/users/jmhullot Jean-Marie Hullot - fotopedia] * [http://www.inria.fr/40ans/forum/intervenants.en.php#hullot INRIA] * [http://docs.abondance.com/interview_realnames.html Interview, December 1999] (in French) * [http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/18/ex-apple-team-prepares-to-launch-stealth-startup/ Ex-Apple Team To Launch Stealth Startup Fotonauts] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME =Hullot, Jean-Marie | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH =1954-02-16 | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Paris, France]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Hullot, Jean-Marie}} [[Category:1954 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Apple Inc. employees]] [[Category:French computer programmers]] [[Category:French computer scientists]] [[Category:University of Paris alumni]] [[fr:Jean-Marie Hullot]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19821</id> <title>Jean-Raymond Abrial</title> <text>[[Image:Replace this image male.svg|right]] '''Jean-Raymond Abrial''' (born 1938) is a [[France|French]] computer scientist and inventor of the [[Z notation|Z]] and [[B-Method|B]] [[formal methods]]. J.-R. Abrial is the father of the [[Z notation]] (typically used for [[formal specification]] of software), during his time at the [[Programming Research Group]] within the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory]], and later the [[B-Method]] (normally used for software development), two leading [[formal methods]] for [[software engineering]]. He is the author of ''The B-Book: Assigning Programs to Meanings'' (ISBN 0-521-49619-5). For much of his career he has been an independent consultant, as much at home working with industry as academia. Currently he is a [[Professor]] at [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Switzerland]]. ==See also== * [http://videotorium.hu/en/recordings/details/1674,Have_we_learned_from_the_Wasa_disaster_ Have we learned from the Wasa disaster (video)] ==External links== * {{dblp name|id=a/Abrial:Jean=Raymond|name=Jean-Raymond Abrial}} * [http://web.archive.org/web/20071202063524/http://www.jpbowen.com/publications/thes-b.html Review of ''The B-Book''] *''[http://www.inf.ethz.ch/news/focus/res_focus/feb_2005 Managing the Construction of Large Computerized Systems]'' — article {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Abrial, Jean-Raymond | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Abrial, Jean-Raymond}} [[Category:1938 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:French computer scientists]] [[Category:Members of Oxford University Computing Laboratory]] [[Category:Formal methods people]] [[Category:Z notation]] [[Category:Computer science writers]] [[Category:Software engineers]] {{France-compu-bio-stub}} [[fr:Jean-Raymond Abrial]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19827</id> <title>Jean Serra</title> <text>{{Infobox scientist | name = Jean Serra | image = |277px | image_width = 313px | birth_date = 1940 | birth_place = [[Algeria]] | citizenship = {{flag|France}} | work_institution = [[Centre de Morphologie Mathématique]], [[École des Mines de Paris]] | field = [[Mathematics]], [[geology]] | known_for = co-founding [[Mathematical morphology]] }} '''Jean Paul Frédéric Serra''' (born 1940 in [[Algeria]]) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and [[engineer]], and known as one of the co-founders (together with [[Georges Matheron]]) of [[mathematical morphology]]. ==Biography== ===Education=== Serra received a scientific [[baccalauréat]] in 1957, and an [[engineering]] [[academic degree|degree]] from the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy]] in 1962. He also obtained a [[Bachelor]] degree in [[philosophy]]/[[psychology]], from the [[University of Nancy]], in 1965. He obtained a [[PhD]] in [[Mathematical Geology]] from the University of Nancy in 1967, and a ''[[doctorat]] d'etat'' in [[Mathematics]], from the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]], [[Paris]], in 1986. He speaks [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. ===Mathematical morphology=== From 1962 to 1966, while a research engineer at the ''[[Institut de recherche de la sidérurgie]]'', France, Serra was a PhD student under the supervision of [[Georges Matheron]]. The subject of his [[thesis]] was "[[stochastic]] [[Geologic modelling|modeling]] of the [[iron]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposit]] of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], at various scales," one of the goals of which was to quantify [[petrographic]] characteristics of its iron [[ore]]body. During that period, Serra came up with the idea of using [[structuring element]]s for transforming images of [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]s of the ore, in order to gain information about it. The result was a device called "Texture Analyser", which was [[patent]]ed in 1965. This work also lead to the concept of [[hit-or-miss transform]], which evolved into the concepts of [[erosion (morphology)|erosion]], [[dilation (morphology)|dilation]], [[opening (morphology)|opening]] and [[closing (morphology)|closing]] due to Matheron. [[Granulometry (morphology)|Granulometry]] and other concepts followed. In the Winter of 1966, in a pub of Nancy,<ref>"Appendix A: The 'centre de morphologie mathematique': An overview" by Jean Serra, in ([[#serra94|Serra and Soille (Eds.) 1994]]).</ref> Matheron, [[Philippe Formery]], and Serra decided to give a name to this body of works: "Mathematical morphology". The new theory and method has since evolved to be applied in a variety of [[image processing]] problems and tasks, and is researched worldwide<ref>See, e.g., ([[#banon07|Banon, Barrera, and Braga-Neto (Eds.) 2007]])</ref> (''main article: [[Mathematical morphology]]''). In 1968, the [[Centre of Mathematical Morphology]] (CMM) of the [[École des Mines de Paris]] was created (after 1979, it was called ''Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology''). Matheron was named director, and Serra was hired as master of research ("Maître de Recherches") and [[assistant director]]. In 1986, upon the split of the ''Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology'' into two separate centers, Serra became director of research ("Directeur de Recherches") and the director of the new CMM. Serra has continued to contribute to mathematical morphology over the years; In fact, some of the most important theoretical developments are due to him: * Generalization of mathematical morphology to [[complete lattice]]s * Theory for [[morphological filtering]], with Matheron * [[Connection (morphology)|Connections]] ===Additional highlights=== * 1979&ndash;1983: [[Vice-president]] of the [[International Society for Stereology]]. * 1983&ndash;: Member of the [[editorial board]] of [[Acta Stereologica]]. * 1988&ndash;1991:
