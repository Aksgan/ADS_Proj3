(MRL) at McGill on many problems involving aspects of artificial perception, robot navigation, "hiring secretaries" problem, and recommender systems. ==Education== Dudek obtained his B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science and [[Queen's University]] and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [[University of Toronto]]. ==Activities== Gregory always enjoys the challenge of using a new gadget. He keeps up to date with the latest technologies and very much enjoys coding things. Gregory's research interests often overlap with his personal life and allow him to travel to many interesting places. He and other students in the MRL lab take trips to run experiments on Aqua, an amphibious robot. Greg visited Mexico in 2009. Greg has also visited many other countries. ==External links== * [http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dudek/ Gregory Dudek web site] * [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=313783 Localizing a robot with minimum travel (official link, but only abstract is free)] * [http://citeseer.comp.nus.edu.sg/657624.html Localizing a robot with minimum travel (free link)] {{DEFAULTSORT:Dudek, Gregory}} [[Category:Canadian computer scientists|Dudek, Gregory]] [[Category:Canadian people of Polish descent]] [[Category:People from Montreal]] [[Category:Queen's University alumni]] [[Category:University of Toronto alumni]] [[Category:McGill University faculty|Dudek, Gregory]] [[Category:Anglophone Quebec people]] [[Category:Canadian bloggers]] [[Category:Living people]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15826</id> <title>Grid.org</title> <text>{{lowercase}} '''grid.org''' was a website and online community established in [[2001]] that focuses on [[cluster computing]] and [[grid computing]] software for users. For the first 6 years of its history it operated several different [[volunteer computing]] projects that allowed members to donate their spare computer cycles to worthwhile causes. More recently, it has been relaunched as a community for [[open source]] cluster and grid computing software. The website now points to the [[UniCluster]] website. == Open Source grid community == Since its relaunch in November 2007, grid.org has been repositioned by [[Univa]] as a community to allow users to interact and discuss open source cluster and grid related topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grid.org/about-grid-org|title=About grid.org|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref> It also allows users to download, get support for, contribute to, and report issues about the open source [[Globus Toolkit]] based products offered by Univa. == Past volunteer computing projects == From its establishment in April 2001 until April 27, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.grid.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=599007#599007|title=All Good Things Come To An End…|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> grid.org was the website and organization that ran [[distributed computing]] projects such as the [[United Devices]] Cancer Research Project. It was sponsored philanthropically by [[United Devices]] (UD) and members participated in [[volunteer computing]] by running the UD Agent software (version 3.0). {| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" !

The program, which can also be set to run continually, uses "virtual screening" to find possible interactions between molecules and target proteins, i.e. a drug. These molecules ([[ligand]]s) are sent to the host computer's UD Agent. When these molecules dock successfully with a target protein this interaction is scored for further investigation. The research consisted of two phases: * Phase 1 tested over 3 billion drug-like molecules against 12 proteins which were known to be suitable targets for anti-cancer drugs. It used the "THINK" software for the simulation of the molecular interactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/cancer/thinkcalculations.html|title=Think phase 1 computation|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> * Phase 2, using the "LigandFit" software developed by [[Accelrys]] to model interactions, sought to refine the Phase 1 data to produce a more manageable list of drug candidates for testing that would require experimental collaborators, including some from industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/cancer/ligandfit.htm|title=LigandFit explained|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/cancer/phaseii.html|title=Phase 2 of the Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> === Human Proteome Folding Project, phase 1 === {{main|Human Proteome Folding Project}} The [[IBM]]-sponsored ''Human Proteome Folding Project'' ("HPF"), phase 1, was announced on November 16, 2004 and was completed July 3, 2006.

The status of the Human Proteome Folding Project caused some discussion on the grid.org forums.
