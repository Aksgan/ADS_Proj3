of the economic actors (corporations, government, households) in an economy, including their relations with other countries' economies, and their wealth. They present both flows during a period and stocks at the end of a period, ensuring that the flows are fully reconciled with the stocks. National accounts also include measures of the stocks and flows of financial assets and liabilities (commonly called "financial accounts" or "[[Flow of Funds|flow of funds]]" accounts). There are a number of aggregate measures in the national accounts, most notably gross domestic product or [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] - which is the most widely used measure of aggregate economic activity in a period - disposable income, saving and investment. These provide examples of [[macroeconomic|macro]]-[[economic data]]. Such aggregate measures and their development over time are generally of strongest interest to economic policymakers, although the detailed national accounts contain a rich source of information for economic analysis, for example in the [[Input-output model|input-output tables]] which show how industries interact with each other in the production process. For example, in the United States the [[National Income and Product Accounts|national income and product accounts]] (NIPA) provide estimates for the money value of income and output respectively per year or quarter, including [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. NIPA entries are called ''[[Stock and flow|flows]]'', to indicate that they are measured over time. Another application is the national [[balance sheet]] as to assets on one side, including the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] stock, and liabilities and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] on the other, measured as of the end of the accounting period. Entries here are called ''[[Stock and flow|stocks]]'', to indicate their accumulation to a point in time, as distinct from a ''[[Stock and flow|flow]]'', which is measured over time. National accounts can be presented in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal from real amounts]], that is, correcting money totals for price changes over time.<ref> • [[Amartya Sen]], 1979.

The accounts are derived from a wide variety of [[statistics|statistical]] source data including [[Statistical survey|surveys]], administrative and census data, and regulatory data, which are integrated and harmonized in the conceptual framework. They are usually compiled by national statistical offices and/or central banks in each country, though this is not always the case, and may be released on both an annual and (less detailed) quarterly frequency. Two developments relevant to the national accounts since the 1980s include the following. [[Generational accounting]] is a method for measuring redistribution of lifetime [[tax burden]]s across generations from [[social insurance]], including [[social security]] and [[social health insurance]]. It has been proposed as a better guide to the sustainability of a [[fiscal policy]] than [[budget deficit]]s, which reflect only taxes minus spending in the current year.<ref> • ''[[The Economist]]'', Economics A-Z, [http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/searchActionTerms.cfm?query=generational+accounting "Generational Accounting."] Accessed 9 Aug. 2010.<br/> • Jagadeesh Gokhale, 2008.

The balancing item of the accounts is value added, which is equal to GDP when expressed for the whole economy at market prices and in gross terms; ::'''income accounts''', which show primary and secondary income flows - both the income generated in production (e.g. wages and salaries) and distributive income flows (predominantly the redistributive effects of government taxes and social benefit payments). The balancing item of the accounts is disposable income ("National Income" when measured for the whole economy); ::'''expenditure accounts''', which show how disposable income is either consumed or saved. The balancing item of these accounts is saving. *Capital accounts, which record the net accumulation, as the result of transactions, of non-financial assets; and the financing, by way of saving and capital transfers, of the accumulation. Net lending/borrowing is the balancing item for these accounts *Financial accounts, which show the net acquisition of financial assets and the net incurrence of liabilities. The balance on these accounts is the net change in financial position. *Balance sheets, which record the stock of assets, both financial and non-financial, and liabilities at a particular point in time. Net worth is the balance from the balance sheets (United Nations, 1993). The accounts may be measured as gross or net of consumption of fixed capital (a concept in national accounts similar to depreciation in business accounts). ==History== The original motivation for the development of national accounts and the systematic measurement of employment, was the need for accurate measures of aggregate economic activity. This was made more pressing by the [[Great Depression]] and as a basis for [[Keynesian]] [[macroeconomic]] stabilisation policy and wartime economic planning. The first efforts to develop such measures were undertaken in the late 1920s and 1930s, notably by [[Colin Clark]] and [[Simon Kuznets]].
