5600 processors; and supports up to 96GB of RAM running at 800MHz, 1066MHz or 1333MHz. The diskless nature of the Compute Blades permit a failed Compute Blade to be easily ‘’swapped out’’ (removed and replaced with another Compute Blade), and have the failed Compute Blade’s volume(s) simply re-assigned to the replacement Compute Blade . This provides for increased uptime in a production environment. == Integrated Storage Area Network == The integrated SAN consists of the HDD Module (which accommodates up to fourteen 2.5” HDDs in the MFSYS25 Chassis, and up to six 3.5” HDDs in the MFSYS35 chassis) and the Storage Control Module(s). Each Compute Blade accesses volume(s) which are assigned to it by connecting to the Storage Control Module(s) through its integrated SAS HBA. == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.intelmodularserver.com/ Product microsite] * [http://www.intel.com/Products/Server/Modular-Server/Modular-Server/Modular-Server-overview.htm Product homepage] on the Intel website [[Category:Intel products]] [[Category:Computer hardware]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18721</id> <title>Intel Reader</title> <text>The '''Intel Reader''' is a portable, handheld assistive technology device that allows users to take a photo of printed material and have it read back to them aloud.

Their primary product line, SOA Expressway, is a family of software and hardware XML Gateways ([[XML appliance]]s) that are used in [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA architectures]] on-premise or in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. The appliances interoperate with SOA [[middleware]] & [[SOA Governance|governance]] products and handle [[SOAP]] and [[REST]] for cross-domain integration & security. The Intel SOA Expressway core runtime engine is based on highly-performing XML technology that includes the utilization of an [[X86|Intel Architecture]] using the [[SSE4|SSE 4.2]] instruction set as well as [[Event stream processing|Event Stream]] optimizations developed by [[Sarvega]] (acquired by Intel in 2005.) Intel SOA Expressway for Healthcare is a software product that provides secure interoperability across different domains such as hospitals, state [[Health information exchange|Health Information Exchanges]] (HIE), or national healthcare integration networks. ==Timeline== * March 2000 - Founded by John G.
