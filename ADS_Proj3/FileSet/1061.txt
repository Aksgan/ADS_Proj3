darkness, black. The emotional reaction to darkness has metaphorical importance in many cultures. The dark is monochromatic.Many unspeakable and unknown things happen in the dark. Though some may find it scary, while some may not. The dark is where Shadow Men reside according to Norse Mythology. They reside in the dark and prey on the fear of humans. ==Scientific== A dark object absorbs [[photons]], and therefore appears dim in comparison to other objects. For example, matte black paint does not reflect visible light and appears dark, but white paint reflects all visible light and appears bright.<ref>{{cite paper | author = Mantese, Lucymarie | title = Photon-Driven Localization: How Materials Really Absorb Light | publisher = American Physical Society | date = March 2000 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000APS..MAR.E2001M | accessdate = 2007-01-21 }} </ref> For more information see [[color]]. However light cannot simply be absorbed without limit. [[Energy]], like visible light, cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be converted from one type of energy to another. Most objects that absorb visible light reemit it as infrared light.<ref>{{cite paper | author = Dr. Denise Smith | title = Exploring the Electromagnetic Spectrum: The Herschel Experiment | publisher = Space Telescope Science Institute | url = http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/work_con_lec/astro_wkshp_res/boston_herschel.ppt | format = powerpoint | accessdate = 2007-01-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206175002/http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/work_con_lec/astro_wkshp_res/boston_herschel.ppt <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-06}} </ref> So, although an object may appear dark, it is likely bright at a frequency that a human being cannot see.

[[File:Dividing Light from Darkness.jpg|thumb|Separation of light and darkness, from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] by [[Michelangelo]]]] A dark area has limited light sources, making things hard to see. Exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness. When a [[vertebrate]], like a human, enters a dark area, its [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] dilates, allowing more light to enter the eye and improving [[night vision]]. Also, the light detecting cells in the human eye ([[rods and cones]]) will regenerate more unbleached [[rhodopsin]] when adapting to darkness. One scientific measure of darkness is the [[Bortle Dark-Sky Scale]], which indicates the night sky's and stars' brightness at a particular location, and the observability of celestial objects at that location. (See also: [[Sky brightness]]) ==Cultural== {{see|Light and darkness}} ===Poetic=== As a poetic term in the [[Western world]], darkness can also mean the presence of shadows, evil, or depression. Religious texts often use darkness to make a visual point. In the [[Bible]], darkness was the second to last plague (Exodus 10:21) and the location of “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew 8:12)<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/ BibleGateway.com]</ref> The [[Qur’an]] has been interpreted to say that those who transgress the bounds of what is right are doomed to “burning despair and ice-cold darkness.” (Nab 78.25)<ref>{{cite web | title = Online translation of The Quran | url = http://www.islamicity.com/quransearch/ | accessdate = November 2010 }}</ref> In [[Chinese philosophy]] Yin is the feminine part of the [[Taijitu]] and is represented by a dark lobe. The use of darkness as a [[rhetorical device]] has a long standing tradition. Shakespeare, working in the 16th and 17th centuries, made a character called Satan, the “[[prince of darkness]]” ([[King Lear]]: III, iv) and gave darkness jaws with which to devour love.

''Genip'' meant “mist” and fell out of use like many [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]]s. It is however still used in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] saying "in het geniep" which means secretly. ''Sceadu'' meant “shadow” and remained in use. The word ''dark'' eventually evolved from the word ''deorc''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglass | title = Dark | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | month = November | year = 2001 | url = http://www.etymonline.com | accessdate = 2007-01-18 }}</ref> ===Artistic=== [[File:CaravaggioContarelli.jpg|thumb|[[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of St Matthew]]'' uses darkness for its [[chiaroscuro]] effects.]] {{unreferenced-section|date=January 2010}} Artistically, darkness can also be used to emphasize or contrast with light. See [[chiaroscuro]] for a discussion of the uses of such contrasts in visual media. Color [[paints]] are mixed together to create darkness, because each color absorbs certain frequencies of light. Theoretically, mixing together the three primary colors, or the three secondary colors, will absorb all visible light and create black. In practice it is difficult to prevent the mixture from taking on a brown tint. The color of a [[pixel|point]], on a standard 24-bit [[computer display]], is defined by three numbers between 0 and 255, one each for red, green, and blue. Because the absence of light creates darkness, darker colors are closer to (0,0,0). Paintings may use darkness to create [[leading lines]] and [[voids]], among other things. These shapes are designed to draw the eye around the painting. Shadows add perspective. ==See also== {{wiktionary}} {{commonscat}} *[[Lightness (color)]] *[[Dark tourism]] - [[travel]] to sites associated with [[death]] and [[suffering]] *[[Shadow]] ==References==
