TENS by definition covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain.<ref>Robetson et al., 4th ed.</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (>50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (<10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.<ref>{{Cite book | edition = Third | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | isbn = 0781744849 | last = Robinson | first = Andrew J | coauthors = Lynn Snyder-Mackler | title = Clinical Electrophysiology: Electrotherapy and Electrophysiologic Testing | date = 2007-09-01 }} </ref> ==History== Electrical stimulation for pain control was used in [[ancient Greece]], 63 A.D. It was reported by [[Scribonius Largus]] that pain was relieved by standing on an electrical fish at the seashore.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jensen JE, Conn RR, Hazelrigg G, Hewett JE |title=The use of transcutaneous neural stimulation and isokinetic testing in arthroscopic knee surgery |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=1985 |pmid=3872082 |url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/27 |doi=10.1177/036354658501300105}}</ref> In the 16th through the 18th century various [[electrostatic]] devices were used for headache and other pains. [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a proponent of this method for pain relief. In the nineteenth century a device called the electreat, along with numerous other devices were used for pain control and cancer cures. Only the electreat survived into the twentieth century, but was not portable, and had limited control of the stimulus. The first modern, patient-wearable TENS was patented in the United States in 1974.<ref>{{US patent|3817254}}</ref> It was initially used for testing the tolerance of [[chronic pain]] patients to electrical stimulation before [[spinal Cord Stimulator|implantation of electrodes in the spinal cord dorsal column]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Burton C |title=Instrumentation for dorsal column stimulator implantation |journal=Surg Neurol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=39–40 |year=1974 |month=Jan |pmid=4810453 }}</ref> The electrodes were attached to an implanted receiver, which received its power from an antenna worn on the surface of the skin. Although intended only for testing tolerance to electrical stimulation, many{{Weasel-inline|date=June 2009}} of the patients got so much relief from the TENS itself that they never returned for the implant. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} A number of companies began manufacturing TENS units after the commercial success of the [[Medtronic]] device became known.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The neurological division of Medtronic, founded by Don Maurer, Ed Schuck and Dr. Charles Ray, developed a number of applications for implanted electrical stimulation devices for treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the nervous system. Maurer founded Empi, Inc. in 1977, and in the late 1980s purchased the TENS product line from Medtronic. Today many people confuse TENS with [[Electro Muscle Stimulation]] (EMS). EMS and TENS devices look similar, with both using long electric lead wires and electrodes. TENS is for blocking pain, where EMS is for stimulating muscles. ==Uses== === Medical === {{Ref improve section|date=July 2010}} TENS is a non-invasive, safe nerve stimulation intended to reduce pain, both acute and chronic. While controversy exists as to its effectiveness in the treatment of chronic pain, a number of systematic reviews or meta-analyses have confirmed its effectiveness for postoperative pain, osteoarthritis, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Johnson M, Martinson, M |title=Efficacy of electrical nerve stimulation for chronic musculoskeletal pain: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Pain |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=157–165 |year=2006 |pmid= 17383095|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.02.007 |url=http://www.painjournalonline.com/article/S0304-3959(07)00073-5/abstract}}</ref> Conversely, results from the Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain, reported in early 2008, showed no clinically significant benefit to TENS for the treatment of neck pain when compared to sham treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= |title=The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders: Executive Summary |journal=Spine |volume=33 |issue=4S Supplement |pages=S5–7 |date=15 February 2008 |url=http://www.spinejournal.com/pt/re/spine/fulltext.00007632-200802151-00004.htm;jsessionid=JnnRzQxYsPbn2R14TVybSpYpR4yD9z2PG9TQl6Rcdh4HgpJwSJ9v!1173332523!181195629!8091!-1 |doi= 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181643f40 |last1= Haldeman |first1= Scott |pmid= 18204400 |last2= Carroll |first2= L |last3= Cassidy |first3= JD |last4= Schubert |first4= J |last5= Nygren |first5= A |author6= Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders}}</ref> A January 2010, systematic literature search published in the journal ''Neurology'',<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c918fc | issn = 1526-632X | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–176 | last = Dubinsky | first = Richard M | coauthors = Janis Miyasaki | title = Assessment: efficacy of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in the treatment of pain in neurologic disorders (an evidence-based review): report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology | journal = Neurology | accessdate = 2010-03-05 | date = 2010-01-12 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042705 | pmid = 20042705 }}</ref> advised against recommending TENS for chronic low back pain since evidence is controversial
