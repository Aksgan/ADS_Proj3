of philosophy as a criterion.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 5&ndash;6.</ref> ===Intuition=== [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] is an assumed truth with an unknown, or unexamined, source. It is a judgment without [[Rationality|rational]] examination of the facts. Many persons experience intuitive epiphanies which later prove to be true. Scholars have sometimes come upon valid theories and proofs while daydreaming or otherwise mentally occupied with something bearing no apparent relationship to the truth they seek to reveal. Intuition is at best a source for truths, rather than a criterion with which to evaluate them. Intuitive knowledge requires testing by means of other criteria of truth in order to confirm its accuracy.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 6.</ref> ===Majority rule=== [[Majority rule]] is a statistical method of accepting assertions and proposals. In [[democracy|democratic systems]], majority rule is used to determine group decisions, particular those relating to personal [[morality]] and [[social behavior]]. Some systems divided into several oppositional factions may depend on mere [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]].{{dn}} While majority rule may make for a good democratic system, it is a poor determinant of truth, subject to the criticisms of the broad version of ''[[consensus gentium]]''.<ref name=sahakian1993p7/> ===Naïve Realism=== [[Naïve realism|Naïve Realism]] posits that only that which is directly observable by the [[human senses]] is true. First-hand observation determines the truth or falsity of a given statement. Naïve Realism is an insufficient criterion of truth. A host of natural phenomena are demonstrably true, but not observable by the unaided sense. For example, Naïve Realism would deny the existence of [[ultrasound|sounds beyond the range of human hearing]] and the existence of [[x-rays]]. Similarly, there are a number of sense experiments which show a disconnect between the perceived sensation and the reality of its cause.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 7&ndash;8.</ref> ===Pragmatic=== {{See also|Pragmatic theory of truth}} {{See also|Scientific method}} If an idea works then it must be true, to the Pragmatist. The consequences of applying a concept reveal its [[truth value]] upon examination of the results. The full meaning of an idea is self-apparent in its application. For example, the therapeutic value and effect of penicillin in relation to infections is proven in its administration. Although [[Pragmatism]] is considered a valuable criterion, it must be used with caution and reservation, due to its potential for false positives. For example, a doctor may prescribe a patient medication for an illness, but it could later turn out that a placebo is equally as effective. Thus, untrue concepts could appear to be working contrary to the purpose of the pragmatic test. However, it has validity as a test, particularly in the form [[William Hocking]] called "Negative Pragmatism". In essence, it states that ideas that do not work cannot possibly be true, though ideas which do work may or may not be true.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 9.</ref> Though Hocking defined Negative Pragmatism prior to 1912, it was never popularized. In his 7th lecture of the series he gave at Cornell in 1964-65, Noble Prize winning physicist, [[Richard Feynman]], again defined Negative Pragmatism: "We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong."<ref>Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 152.</ref> However, Feynman did not name this criteria of truth, and since he did not reference Hocking, Feynman may have been unaware that this criteria had already been defined and published. To highlight the potency and validity of Negative Pragmatism, Feynman used a failure of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] which had held "true" for "several hundred years".<ref>Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 152.</ref> Thus, Newton's law of universal gravitation was a "false positive" using the Pragmatic approach, but Negative Pragmatism caught the error in the end. ===Revelation=== The principal distinction between intuition and [[revelation]] is that revelation has an assumed source: [[God]] (or another higher power). Revelation may be defined as truth emanating from God. Many [[religion]]s fundamentally rely on revelation as a test of truth. This criterion is subject to the same criticisms as intuition. It may be a valid reference of truth for an individual, but it is inadequate for providing a coherent proof of the knowledge to others.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 6&ndash;7.</ref> ===Time=== Time is a criterion commonly appealed to in debate, often referred to as "[[the test of time]]". This criterion posits that over time erroneous beliefs and logical errors will be revealed, while if the belief is true, the mere passage of time cannot adversely affect its [[validity]]. Time is an inadequate test for truth, since it is subject to similar flaws as custom and tradition (which are simply specific variations of the time factor). Many demonstrably false beliefs have endured for centuries and even millennia. It is commonly rejected as a valid criterion. For example, most people will not convert to another faith simply because the other religion is centuries (or even millennia) older than their current beliefs.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 4&ndash;5.</ref> ===Tradition=== [[Tradition]], closely related to custom, is the standard stating that which is held for generations is true. Those accepting tradition argue that ideas gaining the loyalty multiple generations possesses a measure of credibility. Tradition possesses many of the same failings as custom. It is possible for falsehoods to be passed down from generation to generation, since tradition generally emphasizes repetition over [[critical thinking|critical evaluation]].<ref name=sahakian1993p4/> == See also == {{Portal|Thinking}} {{Wikipedia-Books|Epistemology}} {{Columns-list|2| * [[Conceptual framework]] * [[Contextualism]] * [[Fallibilism]] * [[Anekantavada]] * [[Exclusive disjunction]] * [[Degrees of truth]] * [[False dilemma]] * [[Fuzzy logic]] * [[Logical equality]] * [[Logical value]] * [[Multi-valued logic]] * [[Propositional logic]] * [[Relativism]] * [[Principle of Bivalence]] }} ==Footnotes== {{Reflist|2}} {{Philosophy topics}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Criteria Of Truth}} [[Category:Epistemology]] [[Category:Philosophical logic]] [[Category:Theories of truth]] [[sk:Kritérium pravdivosti]] [[uk:Критерій істини]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8450</id> <title>Critical Internet infrastructure</title> <text>{{orphan|date=December 2009}} '''Critical Internet infrastructure''' is a collective term for all hardware and software systems that constitute essential components in the operation of the [[Internet]].
