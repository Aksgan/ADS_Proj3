The current stable version of ALynx is 1.29 and is still available for downloaded from the Amiga Aminet Repository. Version 1.31 is also available. == History == ALynx: Amiga port of Lynx was ported to Amiga in 1995 by P. Marquardt. It was a porting of Lynx, which is a general-purpose distributed information browser and is part of the World Wide Web project. Lynx was designed to support a Campus Wide Information System (CWIS), but can be used for many other applications. This browser is no longer being developed on Amiga. == See also == * [[AMosaic (web browser)|AMosaic]] * [[AWeb (web browser)|AWeb]] * [[IBrowse (web browser)|IBrowse]] * [[NetSurf]] * [[Origyn Web Browser]] * [[Sputnik browser|Sputnik]] * [[TimberWolf Browser|TimberWolf]] * [[Voyager (web browser)|Voyager]] == External links == * [http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~alynx/ ALynx homepage] * [http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~alynx/ALynx/history.HTML History] * [http://aminet.net/ Aminet] {{Earlybrowsers}} {{Web browsers}} {{AmigaOS}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Alynx}} [[Category:Text-based web browsers]] [[Category:Amiga software]] [[Category:Web browsers for AmigaOS]] [[Category:Discontinued web browsers]] {{web-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>416</id> <title>AMPL</title> <text>{{Infobox programming language | name = AMPL | logo = [[Image:Ampl.jpg]] | caption = | paradigm = | year = 1990 | designer =
