Modals qualify the truth of a judgment. For example, if it is true that "John is happy," we might qualify this statement by saying that "John is ''usually'' happy," in which case the term "usually" would be a modality. Traditionally, there are three "modes" or "moods" or "modalities" represented in modal logic, namely, ''[[Logical possibility|possibility]]'', ''[[probability]]'', and ''[[Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions#Necessary_conditions|necessity]]''. A formal modal logic represents modalities using [[modal operator]]s. For example, "It might rain today" and "It is possible that rain will fall today" both contain the notion of possibility. In a modal logic this is represented as an operator, ''Possibly'', attached to the sentence ''It will rain today''. The basic [[Unary operation|unary]] (1-place) modal operators are usually written <math>\Box</math> for ''Necessarily'' and <math>\Diamond</math> for ''Possibly''. In a [[classical modal logic]], each can be expressed by the other with [[negation]]: :<math>\Diamond P \leftrightarrow \lnot \Box \lnot P;</math> :<math>\Box P \leftrightarrow \lnot \Diamond \lnot P.</math> Thus it is ''possible'' that it will rain today if and only if it is ''not necessary'' that it will ''not'' rain today;<br /> and it is ''necessary'' that it will rain today if and only if it is ''not possible'' that it will ''not'' rain today. ==Development of modal logic == Although [[Aristotle]]'s logic is almost entirely concerned with the theory of the [[categorical syllogism]], there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with potentiality and time. Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the [[Scholastics]], in particular [[William of Ockham]] and [[John Duns Scotus]], who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about [[essence]] and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]. [[C. I. Lewis]] founded modern modal logic in his 1910 Harvard thesis and in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912. This work culminated in his 1932 book ''Symbolic Logic'' (with C. H. Langford), which introduced the five systems ''S1'' through ''S5''. Ruth C. Barcan (later Ruth Barcan Marcus) developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic &mdash; first and second order extensions of Lewis's "S2", "S4", and "S5". The contemporary era in modal semantics began in 1959, when [[Saul Kripke]] (then only a 19 year old [[Harvard University]] undergraduate) introduced the now-standard [[Kripke semantics]] for modal logics. These are commonly referred to as "possible worlds" semantics. Kripke and [[A. N. Prior]] had previously corresponded at some length. [[A. N. Prior]] created modern [[temporal logic]], closely related to modal logic, in 1957 by adding modal operators [F] and [P] meaning "henceforth" and "hitherto". [[Vaughan Pratt]] introduced [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] in 1976. In 1977, [[Amir Pnueli]] proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating concurrent programs. Flavors of temporal logic include propositional dynamic logic (PDL), propositional linear temporal logic (PLTL), [[linear temporal logic]] (LTL), [[computational tree logic]] (CTL), [[Hennessy-Milner logic|Hennessy&ndash;Milner logic]], and ''T''. The mathematical structure of modal logic, namely [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s augmented with [[unary operation]]s (often called "modal algebras"), began to emerge with J. C. C. McKinsey's 1941 proof that ''S2'' and ''S4'' are decidable, and reached full flower in the work of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his student [[Bjarni Jonsson]] (Jonsson and Tarski 1951&ndash;52). This work revealed that ''S4'' and ''S5'' are models of [[interior algebra]], a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the [[interior operator|interior]] and [[closure operator]]s of [[topology]]. Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[topology]]. For a thorough survey of the history of formal modal logic and of the associated mathematics, see [http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~rob/papers/modalhist.pdf Goldblatt (2006).] ==Formalizations== ===Semantics=== The semantics for modal logic are usually given like so:<ref>Fitting and Mendelsohn. ''First-Order Modal Logic''. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998. Section 1.6</ref> First we define a ''frame'', which consists of a non-empty set, ''G'', whose members are generally called possible worlds, and a binary relation, ''R'', that holds (or not) between the possible worlds of ''G''. This binary relation is called the ''[[accessibility relation]]''. For example, ''w'' ''R'' ''v'' means that the world ''v'' is accessible from world ''w''. That is to say, the state of affairs known as ''v'' is a live possibility for ''w''. This gives a pair, <''G'', ''R''>. Next, the ''frame'' is extended to a ''model'' by specifying the [[truth-value]]s of all propositions at each of the worlds in ''G''. We do so by defining a relation ⊨ between possible worlds and propositional letters. If there is a world ''w'' such that ''w'' ⊨ P, then P is true at ''w''. A model is thus an ordered triple, <''G'', ''R'', ⊨>. Then we
