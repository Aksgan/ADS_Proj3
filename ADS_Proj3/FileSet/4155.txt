With [[Steam (software)|Steam]], Valve can distribute automatic updates with new versions of the engine among its many users. In practice however, there have been occasional breaks in this chain of compatibility. The release of [[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] and [[The Orange Box]] both introduced new versions of the engine that could not be used to run older games or [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] without the developers performing upgrades to code and, in some cases, content. But both times the work required to move from the older version to the newer was significantly less than what one might have come to expect from other engines - as was demonstrated in 2010, when Valve updated all of their core Source games to the very latest engine build.<ref name="vdc_src2009">{{cite web|title=Source 2009|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_2009#Availability|work=Valve Developer Community|accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> ; [[High dynamic range rendering]] (2005, [[Day of Defeat: Source]]) : Simulation of a camera [[aperture]] and the ability to fake the effects of brightness values beyond computer monitors' actual range.
