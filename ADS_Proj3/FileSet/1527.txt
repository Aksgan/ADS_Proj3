negative aerodynamic stability in some flight regimes, the rapid-reacting CCV controls compensating for the lack of natural stability.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Pre-flight safety checks of a fly-by-wire system are often performed using [[Built-In Test Equipment]] (BITE). On programming the system, either by the pilot or groundcrew, a number of control movement steps are automatically performed. Any failure will be indicated to the crews.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Some aircraft, the [[Panavia Tornado]] for example, retain a very basic hydro-mechanical backup system for limited flight control capability on losing electrical power, in the case of the Tornado this allows rudimentary control of the [[stabilator]]s only for pitch and roll axis movements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ===Weight Saving=== A FBW aircraft can be lighter than a similar design with conventional controls. Partly due to the lower overall weight of the system components; and partly because the natural aerodynamic stability of the aircraft can be relaxed, slightly for a transport aircraft and more for a maneuverable fighter, which means that the stability surfaces that are part of the aircraft structure can therefore be made smaller. These include the vertical and horizontal stabilizers (fin and tailplane) that are (normally) at the rear of the [[fuselage]]. If these structures can be reduced in size, airframe weight is reduced. The advantages of FBW controls were first exploited by the military and then in the commercial airline market. The Airbus series of airliners used full-authority FBW controls beginning with their A320 series, see [[A320 flight control]] (though some limited FBW functions existed on A310).<ref>Dominique Bri√®re, Christian Favre, Pascal Traverse, ''Electrical Flight Controls, From Airbus A320/330/340 to Future Military Transport Aircraft: A Family of Fault-Tolerant Systems'', chapitre 12 du ''Avionics Handbook'', Cary Spitzer ed., CRC Press 2001, ISBN 0-8493-8348-X</ref> Boeing followed with their 777 and later designs. Electronic fly-by-wire systems can respond flexibly to changing aerodynamic conditions, by tailoring [[flight control surfaces|flight control surface]] movements so that aircraft response to control inputs is appropriate to flight conditions. Electronic systems require less maintenance, whereas mechanical and hydraulic systems require lubrication, tension adjustments, leak checks, fluid changes, etc. Furthermore, putting circuitry between pilot and aircraft can enhance safety; for example the control system can try to prevent a stall, or it can stop the pilot from over stressing the airframe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The main concern with fly-by-wire systems is reliability. While traditional mechanical or hydraulic control systems usually fail gradually, the loss of all flight control computers could immediately render the aircraft uncontrollable. For this reason, most fly-by-wire systems incorporate either redundant computers (triplex, quadruplex etc.), some kind of mechanical or hydraulic backup or a combination of both. A "mixed" control system such as the latter is not desirable and modern FBW aircraft normally avoid it by having more independent FBW channels, thereby reducing the possibility of overall failure to minuscule levels that are acceptable to the independent regulatory and safety authority responsible for aircraft design, testing and certification before operational service.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} ===History=== [[Image:F-8C FBW.jpg|thumb|right|[[F-8 Crusader|F-8C Crusader]] digital fly-by-wire testbed]] Electronic signalling of the control surfaces was tested in the 1950s. This replaced long runs of mechanical and hydraulic connections with electrical ones. The first non-experimental aircraft that was designed and flown (in 1958) with a fly-by-wire flight control system was the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]].<ref>W.

This system also included solid-state components and system redundancy, was designed to be integrated with a computerised navigation and automatic search and track radar, was flyable from ground control with data uplink and downlink, and provided artificial feel (feedback) to the pilot.<ref name=Whitcomb/> The first digital fly-by-wire aircraft to take to the air (in 1972) was an [[F-8 Crusader]], which had been modified electronically by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] of the [[United States]] as a [[experimental aircraft|test aircraft]],<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-024-DFRC.html] NASA F-8 www.nasa.gov Retrieved:3 June 2010</ref> a feat mirrored in the USSR by the [[Sukhoi T-4]]. At about the same time in the [[United Kingdom]] a [[trainer aircraft|trainer]] variant of the British [[Hawker Hunter]] fighter was modified at the British [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] with fly-by-wire flight controls for the right-seat pilot. This was [[experimental aircraft|test-flown]], with the left-seat pilot having conventional flight controls for safety reasons, and with the capability for him to override and turn off the fly-by-wire system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} ==Analog systems== All "fly-by-wire" flight control systems eliminate the complexity, the fragility, and the weight of the mechanical circuit of the hydromechanical or electromechanical flight control systems. Fly-by-wire replace those with [[electronics|electronic]] circuits. The control mechanisms in the cockpit now operate signal transducers, which in turn generate the appropriate electronic commands. These are next processed by an electronic controller, either an [[analogue electronics|analog]] one, or more modernly, a [[digital electronics|digital]] one. Aircraft and [[spacecraft]] [[autopilot]]s are now part of the electronic controller.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The hydraulic circuits are similar except that mechanical servo valves are replaced with electrically-controlled servo valves, operated by the electronic controller. This is the simplest and earliest configuration of an analog fly-by-wire flight control system. In this configuration, the flight control systems must simulate "feel". The electronic controller controls electrical feel devices that provide the appropriate "feel" forces on the manual controls. This was used in [[Concorde]], the first production fly-by-wire airliner.<ref>The Tay-Viscount was the first airliner to be fitted with electrical controls [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%200838.html ''Flight'' 1986]</ref> In more sophisticated versions, [[analog computer]]s replaced the electronic controller. The canceled 1950s Canadian supersonic intercepter, the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]], employed this type of system. Analog computers also allowed some customization of flight control characteristics, including [[relaxed stability]]. This was exploited by the early versions of [[F-16]], giving it impressive maneuverability.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} ==Digital
