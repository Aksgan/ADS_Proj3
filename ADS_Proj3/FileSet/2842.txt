mech pilots were accidentally flash frozen in a strange cryogenic accident involving the stasis chambers a few weeks back. Something about scamming parts from the stasis system in an attempt to build a zero-G hottub. The plan was to deal with them when the ship returned to the homeworld. Since your own experience with driving a mech is limited to cheap VR systems, it looks like you will have to pull some fancy tricks with the programmable autopilot systems onboard each mech. Comm systems look operational, but the large amount of dust in the air seems to really mess with the operational range of the laser guided targeting systems. This isn't going to be easy. As if it ever is. It is time to get some hot food and start coding. Unfortunately the crash landing caused the replicators to go on the fritz -- every time you ask for a pizza, a slice is missing. When you ask the computer why it keeps holding back a slice, it claims it needs to taste the pizza first to be sure it's kosher, and that this is a feature. Feature. Right. As if that isn't bad enough, the only drinks the replicators seem to be able to produce are Diet Mountain Dew and Caffeine Free Pepsi. Here you are, the night before the battle, and you are going to die of thirst. Pulling one of your most prized possessions from your vest - a backup tape with the quantum matrix for both Mountain Dew and Jolt Cola - it isn't long before you get the replicator making something useful. With a fresh ANSI standard code-pie (minus one slice) and something decent to drink, you crank the sound system. A smirk crosses your face when you realize what you are wearing. It was an old promotional T-shirt that says "[[CodeWarrior]]: Blood, Sweat, and CODE" How ironic. The enemy will attack at dawn (don't they always?) and you must be ready. Let the hacking begin. ===Dev Team=== * Brian J.

MechManiaII Teams will code the intelligence behind a fleet of starships in a capture-the-flag, Galactic Conquest scenario. 1. The Universe The MechManiaII Universe is composed of N StarSystems, arranged in an XY grid (representing their distances from each other in Hyperspace). N will probably be between 20 and 30, and the grid is looking to be 42x42, but this may change during playtesting. 2. Ships Each Team (the client program written by a MechManiaII Team) controls the actions of a fleet of starships. These Ships may be at a StarSystem, or in Hyperspace, en route to a new StarSystem. Ships have a fixed amount of Power (provided by a fusion reactor or whatnot) that may be allocated to Engines, Shields, Weapons, etc. 3. The Game The game itself will be most likely be a capture-the-flag type thing. Exact specifications will be documented in the "MechManiaII Universe Conquest Manual". It will be turn based -- each 'turn' is a year in game time: all ships in hyperspace move, all ships in a StarSystem may take an action, any combat is evaluated. 4. Game Architecture The game itself is a client-server system. The server maintains the game world, evaluates all actions, and keeps the peace (or lack thereof). The server will run the game. Two team clients will battle for control of the universe. Any number of observer clients will display data (starmaps, team status, etc.) ===Source of the name=== "I will let your Mech live if, in addition to yourself, you turn over to me all material concerning a project called…Caffeine."

No one yet living remembers its exact cause, but no one was too young to be spared its merciless horror as rival terran and colonial clans waged bitter conflict throughout the solar system. Most humans learned to live new lives in hidden bunkers--timid rabbits fearful of slaughter by the most ruthless of the elite warrior class. The only humans who lived in security and comfort were the employees of weapons manufacturers who readily supplied all clans with advanced armaments. Most notable was the line of "MECH" systems, whose sophisticated artificial intelligences aided their pilots and allowed for very complex
