extends the Verbal Behaviorist's explanation of psychological states (like fear, love, desire, thinking etc.) to cognitive states (being aware, knowing, etc.) while denying the premise that [[falsifiability]] criteria can give statements their meaning. The Psychological Nominalist concedes that survival of mental terminology in natural language can be explained in terms of the practical utility of mental-state ascriptions, but denies that this constitutes an analysis of the meaning of any particular mental-state ascription because the Psychological Nominalist contends that the meaning of any term, mental or otherwise, is irreducibly bound with its usage. Thus, the Verbal Behaviorist fails to give a completely philosophically satisfying account of psychological statements because he fails to recognize that the linguistic statements are themselves meaningful in light of the kinds of behavior associated with them.

The system is maintained by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI), a component of the [[National Library of Medicine]], which is part of the United States [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). PubChem can be accessed for free through a [[web user interface]]. Millions of compound structures and descriptive datasets can be freely downloaded via [http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pc_fetch/pc_fetch-help.html FTP]. PubChem contains substance descriptions and small molecules with fewer than 1000 atoms and 1000 bonds. The [[American Chemical Society]] tried to get the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] to restrict the operation of PubChem, because they claim it competes with their [[Chemical Abstracts Service]].<ref>http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/acs_pubchem.html</ref> More than 80 database vendors contribute to the growing PubChem database.<ref>http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sources/sources.cgi</ref> == Databases == PubChem consists of three dynamically growing primary databases. As of 7 January 2011: * Compounds, 31 million entries, contains pure and characterized chemical compounds.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pccompound&term=all%5Bfilt%5D all[filt&#93; - PubChem Compound Results<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> * Substances, 75 million entries, contains also mixtures, [[extract]]s, [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] and uncharacterized substances.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pcsubstance&term=all%5Bfilt%5D all[filt&#93; - PubChem Substance Results<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> * BioAssay, [[bioactivity]] results from 1644 [[high-throughput screening]] programs with several million values.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pcassay&term=all%5Bfilt%5D all[filt&#93; - PubChem BioAssay Results<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> == Searching == Searching the databases is possible for a broad range of properties including chemical structure, name fragments, [[chemical formula]], [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]], [[XLogP]], and [[hydrogen bond]] donor and acceptor count. PubChem contains its own online [[molecule editor]] with [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]]/SMARTS and [[International Chemical Identifier|InChI]] support that allows the import and export of all common [[chemical file format]]s to search for structures and fragments. Each hit provides information about synonyms, chemical properties, chemical structure including SMILES and InChI strings, bioactivity, and links to structurally related compounds and other NCBI databases like [[PubMed]]. In the text search form the database fields can be searched by adding the field name in square brackets to the search term. A numeric range is represented by two numbers separated by a colon. The search terms and field names are case-insensitive. Parentheses and the [[logical operator]]s AND, OR, and NOT can be used. AND is assumed if no operator is used. Example ([[Lipinski's Rule of Five]]): 0:500[mw] 0:5[hbdc] 0:10[hbac] -5:5[logp] ==ACS's concerns== The [[American Chemical Society]] has raised concerns about the publicly supported PubChem database, since it appears to directly compete with their existing [[Chemical Abstracts Service]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.308.5723.774a |year=2005 |month=May |author=Kaiser J |title=Science resources. Chemists want NIH to curtail database |volume=308 |issue=5723 |pages=774 |pmid=15879180 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]}}</ref> They have a strong interest in the issue since the Chemical Abstracts Service generates a large percentage of the society's revenue. To advocate their position against the PubChem database, ACS has actively lobbied the US Congress. == Database fields == {{Cleanup|section|date=November 2009}} {| |- | colspan="3" | <br /> '''Identification numbers''' |- | • || Identification number in current database || [UID] |- | • || Substance identification number || [SID] |- | • || Compound identification number || [CID] |- | • || BioAssay identification number || [BAID], [AID] |- | colspan="3" | <br /> '''General''' |- | • || Any database field || [ALL] |- | • || Comment || [CMT] |- | • || Deposition date || [DDAT], [DEPDAT] |- | • || Depositor's external ID || [SRID], [SRCID] |- | • || Source name || [SRC], [SRCNAM], [SRCNAME] |- | • || Source release date || [SRD], [SRDAT], [RLSDAT] |- | • || [[Medical Subject Heading]] (MeSH) term || [MSHT], [MESHT] |- | • || MeSH tree node || [MSHN], [MESHTN] |- | • || MeSH pharmacological actions || [PHMA], [PHARMA] |- | colspan="3" | <br /> '''Substance properties''' |- | • || Substance synonyms || [SYNO] |- | • || [[IUPAC name]] || [UPAC], [IUPAC] |- | • || [[International Chemical Identifier]] (InChI) || [INCHI] |- | • || [[Molecular mass|Molecular weight]] || [MW], [MWT], [MOLWT] |- | • || [[Chemical element]]s || [ELMT], [EL] |- | • || Non-Hydrogen atoms || [HAC], [HACNT] |- | • || [[Isotope]] count || [IAC], [IACNT] |- | • || Total [[formal charge]] || [TFC], [CHG], [CHRG] |- | • || [[Chirality (chemistry)|Chiral]] atom count || [ACC], [ACCNT] |- | • || Defined chiral atom count || [ACDC], [ACDCNT] |- | • || Undefined chiral atom count || [ACUC], [ACUCNT] |- | • || [[Hydrogen bond]] acceptor count || [HBAC], [HBACNT] |- | • || Hydrogen bond donor count || [HBDC],
