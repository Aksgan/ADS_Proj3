In October 1992 it has grown into a large scientific organization in computer science - Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems of Ukraine (IMMSP NASU ). <br /> SDB MMS, which was the successor of the Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems Problem of [[National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_Ukraine|National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], with full right to be called the cradle of the famous MIR first PC, and managing computers Dnipro, special purpose computer, Delta and other management systems. Today IMMSP NASU is a leading national research centre in the area of contingency management, modelling, decision-making and other innovative technologies. <br /> Immediately after the Chernobyl disaster on the basis of SDB MMS using Situation and Crisis Centre Development Prof. A. Morozov and under his leadership was a system safety assessment of water resources and identified the use of water in the Dnieper River, from which consumes more water half the population of Ukraine. Today the most important research and development of the Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems of NAS of Ukraine devoted to the Situation Centre Defence Minister of Ukraine, information-analytical system "The" Supreme Council of Ukraine. By the way, IMMSP NASU is the basic organization that develops the organizational system of the Ukrainian parliament. Customers developments to support decision-making is also the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the Central Election Commission, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Machine Building, Ministry of Environment and others. <br /> Based IMMSP NASU established and has its own Situation Centre - National Research development support management decisions. <br /> Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems Problem has wide scientific ties. Conducts joint research with scientists from Russia, USA, France, Germany and other countries. <br /> work of scientists of our organization awarded 28 State Prizes of the USSR, Ukraine and NAS of Ukraine, prizes, honours, awards winners have 44 employees. In addition, the Institute scientists have different sings higher legislative and executive authorities (orders, diplomas, etc.). == Field of Studies== The institute focuses basic and applied research in such priority areas as intellectualized system in state building, the automated system of ecological monitoring, modelling, decision making, intelligent information system based on neurocomputers, testing microelectronic production NCS-technology, information security in computer and telephone networks, information technology healthcare and many other areas of modern application of advanced information technologies in practice. <br /> The main activities under the Charter of the Institute - a scientific basis,
