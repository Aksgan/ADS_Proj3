only installed by games or explicitly by the user. [[Windows 95]] did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.<ref>[http://www.computerhope.com/directx.htm DirectX Help<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows NT 4.0]] both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples. Direct3D 9Ex, Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11 are only available for [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] because each of these new versions were built to depend upon the new [[Windows Display Driver Model]] that was introduced for Windows Vista. The new Vista/WDDM graphics architecture includes a new video memory manager that supports virtualizing graphics hardware to multiple applications and services such as the [[Desktop Window Manager]]. ==History== [[Image:DxDiag 4.06.02.0436 showing DirectX 1.0.png|thumb|271px|[[DxDiag]] from DirectX 6.1 (4.06.02.0436) running on<br/>[[Windows 95]] and DirectX 1.0]] In late 1994 Microsoft was on the verge of releasing its next [[operating system]], [[Windows 95]]. The main factor that would determine the value consumers would place on their new operating system very much rested on what programs would be able to run on it. Three Microsoft employees – Craig Eisler, [[Alex St. John]], and Eric Engstrom – were concerned because [[game programmer|programmers]] tended to see Microsoft's previous operating system, [[MS-DOS]], as a better platform for game programming, meaning few games would be developed for Windows 95 and the operating system would not be as much of a success. DOS allowed direct access to video cards, [[computer keyboard|keyboards]], [[computer mouse|mice]], [[sound card|sound devices]], and all other parts of the system, while Windows 95, with its protected memory model, restricted access to all of these, working on a much more standardized model. Microsoft needed a way that would let programmers get what they wanted, and they needed it quickly; the operating system was only months away from being released. Eisler (development lead), St. John, and Engstrom (program manager) worked together to fix this problem, with a solution that they eventually named DirectX. The first version of DirectX was released in September 1995 as the Windows Games SDK. It was the [[Windows API|Win32]] replacement for the DCI<ref>[http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/video-faq/54-What-is-DCI.html What is DCI?]</ref> and [[WinG]] APIs for [[Windows 3.1]]. Simply put, DirectX allowed all versions of Microsoft Windows, starting with Windows 95, to incorporate high-performance multimedia. Eisler wrote about the frenzy to build DirectX 1 through 5 in his blog.<ref>[http://craig.theeislers.com/2006/02/directx_then_and_now_part_1.php Craig Eisler's blog post about the frenzy to build DirectX 1 through 5] on craig.theeislers.com</ref> DirectX 2.0 became a component of Windows itself with the releases of [[Windows 95]] OSR2 and [[Windows NT 4.0]] in mid-1996. As Windows 95 was itself still new and few games had been released for it, Microsoft engaged in heavy promotion of DirectX to developers who were generally distrustful of Microsoft's ability to build a gaming platform in Windows. Alex St. John, working as an evangelist for DirectX, staged an elaborate event at the 1996 [[Game Developers Conference|Computer Game Developers Conference]] which game developer [[Jay Barnson]] described as a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theme, including real [[lion]]s, togas, and something resembling an indoor carnival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rampantgames.com/blog/2006/07/wildest-birthday-party-ever.html |title=Wildest Birthday Party EVER |author=Jay Barnson |date=July 13, 2006 }}</ref> It was at this event that Microsoft first introduced [[Direct3D]] and [[DirectPlay]], and demonstrated multi-player [[MechWarrior 2]] being played over the Internet. The DirectX team faced the challenging task of testing each DirectX release against an array of hardware and software. A variety of different graphics cards, audio cards, motherboards, CPUs, input devices, games, and other multimedia applications were tested with each beta and final release. The DirectX team also built and distributed tests that allowed the hardware industry to confirm that new hardware designs and driver releases would be compatible with DirectX. Prior to DirectX, Microsoft had included [[OpenGL]] on their [[Windows NT]] platform.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windows NT 3.51 Product Overview|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/124814|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=16 September 2010|date=31 October 2006 }}</ref> At the time, [[OpenGL]] required "high-end" hardware and was focused on [[engineering]] and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] uses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Direct3D was intended to be a lightweight partner to OpenGL, focused on game use. As 3D gaming grew, OpenGL evolved to include better support for programming techniques for interactive multimedia applications like games, giving developers choice between using OpenGL or Direct3D as the 3D graphics API for their applications. At that point a "battle" began between supporters of the cross-platform OpenGL and the Windows-only Direct3D. Incidentally, OpenGL was supported at Microsoft by the DirectX team. If a developer chose to use OpenGL 3D graphics API, the other APIs of DirectX are often combined with OpenGL in [[computer games]] because OpenGL does not include all of DirectX's functionality (such as sound or joystick support). In a console-specific version, DirectX was used as a basis for Microsoft's [[Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] [[video game console|console]] API. The API was developed jointly between Microsoft and [[Nvidia]], who developed the custom graphics hardware used by the original Xbox. The Xbox API is similar to DirectX version 8.1, but is non-updateable like other console technologies. The Xbox was code named DirectXbox, but this was shortened to Xbox for its commercial name.<ref>J. Allard, [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/55995/games-interview-xbox-supremo-allard-on-the-future-of-microsofts-console-part-ii.html PC Pro Interview], April 2004</ref> In 2002 Microsoft released DirectX 9 with support for the use of much longer shader programs than before with pixel and vertex shader version 2.0. Microsoft has continued to update the DirectX suite since then, introducing shader model 3.0 in DirectX 9.0c, released in August 2004. As of April 2005, [[DirectShow]] was removed from DirectX and moved to the [[Microsoft Platform SDK]] instead. The DirectX SDK is, however, still required to build the DirectShow samples.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/sdk/readmepage/default.aspx DirectX SDK Release Notes] on [[MSDN]]</ref> ===Releases=== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; font-size: 90%;" |- !
