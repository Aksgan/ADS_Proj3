An important part of nonabelian algebraic topology is concerned with the properties and applications of [[homotopy group]]oids and [[filtered space]]s. Noncommutative [[double groupoid]]s and double [[algebroid]]s are only the first examples of such higher dimensional structures that are nonabelian. The new methods of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT) ''``can be applied to determine [[homotopy invariant]]s of spaces, and [[homotopy classification]] of maps, in cases which include some classical results, and allow results not available by classical methods"''.<ref>http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&from=books&id=374 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered Spaces, Crossed Complexes and Cubical Homotopy groupoids'', by Ronald Brown, Bangor University, UK, Philip J.

Brown et al., '''Axiomathes''', Volume '''17''', Numbers 3-4, 409-493, DOI: 10.1007/s10516-007-9010-3</ref> Further examples of such applications include the generalisations of [[noncommutative geometry]] formalizations of the [[noncommutative standard model]]s ''via'' fundamental double groupoids and [[spacetime]] structures even more general than [[topos|topoi]] or the lower-dimensional [[noncommutative spacetime]]s encountered in several [[topological quantum field theories]] and noncommutative geometry theories of quantum gravity. A fundamental result in NAAT is the generalised, higher homotopy [[van Kampen theorem]] proven by R. Brown which states that ``''the homotopy type of a topological space can be computed by a suitable [[colimit]] or [[homotopy colimit]] over homotopy types of its pieces''''.
