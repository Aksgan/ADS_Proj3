'''[[Meagre set|Meagre]]'''. ;[[First-countable space|First-countable]]: A space is [[First-countable space|first-countable]] if every point has a [[countable]] local base. ;Fréchet: See '''T<sub>1</sub>'''. ;Frontier: See '''[[Boundary (topology)|Boundary]]'''. ;Full set: A [[compact space|compact]] subset ''K'' of the [[complex plane]] is called '''full''' if its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] is connected. For example, the [[closed unit disk]] is full, while the [[unit circle]] is not. ;Functionally separated: Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' in a space ''X'' are functionally separated if there is a continuous map ''f'': ''X'' → [0, 1] such that ''f''(''A'') = 0 and ''f''(''B'') = 1. == G == ;[[G-delta set|''G''<sub>δ</sub> set]]: A [[G-delta set|''G''<sub>δ</sub> set]] is a [[countable]] intersection of open sets. == H == ; [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]: A [[Hausdorff space]] (or '''[[T2 space|T<sub>2</sub>]] space''') is one in which every two distinct points have [[disjoint]] neighbourhoods. Every Hausdorff space is T<sub>1</sub>. ; H-closed: A space is H-closed if it is closed in every Hausdorff space containing it. ; [[Hereditary property|Hereditary]]: A property of spaces is said to be hereditary if whenever a space has that property, then so does every subspace of it. For example, second-countability is a hereditary property. ; [[Homeomorphism]]: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are spaces, a [[homeomorphism]] from ''X'' to ''Y'' is a [[bijection|bijective]] function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' such that ''f'' and ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup> are continuous. The spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are then said to be '''homeomorphic'''. From the standpoint of topology, homeomorphic spaces are identical. ; [[Homogeneous space|Homogeneous]]: A space ''X'' is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] if, for every ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'', there is a homeomorphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. Intuitively, the space looks the same at every point. Every [[topological group]] is homogeneous. ; [[homotopic|Homotopic maps]]: Two continuous maps ''f'', ''g'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' are [[homotopic]] (in ''Y'') if there is a continuous map ''H'' : ''X'' &times; [0, 1] → ''Y'' such that ''H''(''x'', 0) = ''f''(''x'') and ''H''(''x'', 1) = ''g''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. Here, ''X'' &times; [0, 1] is given the product topology. The function ''H'' is called a '''homotopy''' (in ''Y'') between ''f'' and ''g''. ; Homotopy: See '''[[homotopic|Homotopic maps]]'''. ; [[Hyperconnected space|Hyper-connected]]: A space is hyper-connected if no two non-empty open sets are disjoint. Every hyper-connected space is connected. == I == ; Identification map: See '''[[Quotient map]]'''. ; [[Quotient space|Identification space]]: See '''[[Quotient space]]'''. ; [[Indiscrete space]]: See '''[[Trivial topology]]'''. ; [[Infinite-dimensional topology]]: See '''[[Hilbert manifold]]''' and '''[[Q-manifolds]]''', i.e. (generalized) manifolds modelled on the Hilbert space and on the Hilbert cube respectively. ; [[Interior (topology)|Interior]]: The [[interior (topology)|interior]] of a set is the largest open set contained in the original set. It is equal to the union of all open sets contained in it. An element of the interior of a set ''S'' is an '''interior point''' of ''S''. ; Interior point: See '''[[Interior (topology)|Interior]]'''. ; [[Isolated point]]: A point ''x'' is an [[isolated point]] if the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''x''} is open. More generally, if ''S'' is a subset of a space ''X'', and if ''x'' is a point of ''S'', then ''x'' is an isolated point of ''S'' if {''x''} is open in the subspace topology on ''S''. ; Isometric isomorphism: If ''M''<sub>1</sub> and ''M''<sub>2</sub> are metric spaces, an isometric isomorphism from ''M''<sub>1</sub> to ''M''<sub>2</sub> is a [[bijection|bijective]] isometry ''f'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub>. The metric spaces are then said to be '''isometrically isomorphic'''. From the standpoint of metric space theory, isometrically isomorphic spaces are identical. ; Isometry: If (''M''<sub>1</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>) and (''M''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>2</sub>) are metric spaces, an isometry from ''M''<sub>1</sub> to ''M''<sub>2</sub> is a function ''f'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub> such that ''d''<sub>2</sub>(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''y'')) = ''d''<sub>1</sub>(''x'', ''y'') for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''M''<sub>1</sub>. Every isometry is [[Injective function|injective]], although not every isometry is [[surjection|surjective]]. == K == ;[[Kolmogorov space|Kolmogorov axiom]]: See [[T0 space|'''T<sub>0</sub>''']]. ;[[Kuratowski closure axioms]]: The [[Kuratowski closure axioms]] is a set of [[axiom]]s satisfied by the function which takes each subset of ''X'' to its closure: :# ''[[Isotone function|Isotonicity]]'': Every set is contained in its closure. :# ''[[Idempotent function|Idempotence]]'': The closure of the closure of a set is equal to the closure of that set. :# ''Preservation of binary unions'': The closure of the union of two sets is the union of their closures. :# ''Preservation of nullary unions'': The closure of the empty set is empty. :If ''c'' is a function from the [[power set]] of ''X'' to itself, then ''c'' is a '''closure operator''' if it satisfies the Kuratowski closure axioms. The Kuratowski closure axioms can then be used to define a topology on ''X'' by declaring the closed sets to be the [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of this operator, i.e. a set ''A'' is closed [[if and only if]] ''c''(''A'') = ''A''. == L == ;Larger topology: See '''[[Finer topology]]'''. ;[[Limit point]]: A point ''x'' in a space ''X'' is a [[limit point]] of a subset ''S'' if every open set containing ''x'' also contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself. This is equivalent to requiring that every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself. ;Limit point compact: See '''Weakly countably compact'''. ;[[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]]: A space is [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] if every open cover has a [[countable]] subcover. ;[[Local base]]: A set ''B'' of neighbourhoods of a point ''x'' of a space ''X'' is a local base (or '''local basis''', '''neighbourhood base''', '''neighbourhood basis''') at ''x'' if every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains some member of ''B''. ;Local basis: See '''Local base'''. ;Locally closed subset: A subset of a topological space that is the intersection of an open and a closed subset. Equivalently, it is a relatively open subset of its closure. ;[[Locally compact space|Locally compact]]: A space is [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] if every point has a local base consisting of compact neighbourhoods. Every locally compact Hausdorff space is Tychonoff. ;[[Locally connected]]: A space is [[locally connected]] if every point has a local base consisting of connected neighbourhoods. ;Locally finite: A collection of subsets of a space is
