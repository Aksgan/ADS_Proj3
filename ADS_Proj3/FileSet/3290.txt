[[locator software]] and picks the product up at the closest store. This is the method often used in the [[bricks and clicks]] business model. * [[Printing]] out, provision of a code for, or [[email]]ing of such items as [[Ticket (admission)|admission ticket]]s and [[scrip]] (e.g., gift certificates and coupons). The tickets, codes, or coupons may be redeemed at the appropriate physical or online premises and their content reviewed to verify their eligility (e.g., assurances that the right of admission or use is redeemed at the correct time and place, for the correct dollar amount, and for the correct number of uses). * [[Shipping]]: The product is shipped to the customer's address or that of a customer-designated third party. * [[Will call]], COBO (in Care Of Box Office), or "at the door" pickup: The patron picks up pre-purchased tickets for an event, such as a play, sporting event, or concert, either just before the event or in advance. With the onset of the Internet and e-commerce sites, which allow customers to buy tickets online, the popularity of this service has increased. ===Shopping cart systems=== * Simple systems allow the offline administration of products and categories. The shop is then generated as HTML files and graphics that can be uploaded to a webspace. These systems do not use an online database. * A high end solution can be bought or rented as a standalone program or as an addition to an [[enterprise resource planning]] program. It is usually installed on the company's own webserver and may integrate into the existing [[supply chain]] so that ordering, payment, delivery, accounting and warehousing can be automated to a large extent. * Other solutions allow the user to register and create an online shop on a [[web portal|portal]] that hosts multiple shops at the same time. * [[Open source]] shopping cart packages include advanced platforms such as [[Interchange (software)|Interchange]], and off the shelf solutions as [[Avactis]], [[Satchmo (online store)|Satchmo]], [[osCommerce]], [[Magento]], [[Zen Cart]], [[VirtueMart]], [[Batavi (software)|Batavi]], [[PrestaShop]] and [[OpenCart]]. * Commercial systems can also be tailored to one's needs so the shop does not have to be created from scratch. By using a pre-existing framework, software modules for various functionalities required by a web shop can be adapted and combined. ===Online Shopping Malls=== Like many [[online auction]] websites, many websites allow small businesses to create and maintain an [[online shops]] (ecommerce online [[shopping carts]]), without the complexity that involved in purchasing and developing an expensive stand alone [[ecommerce]] software solutions. ==Design== Why does electronic shopping exist? For customers it is not only because of the high level of convenience, but also because of the broader selection; competitive pricing and greater access to information.<ref>Jarvenpaa, S.

King en Juhn-Shiuan Liou, "A framework for internet channel evaluation", International Journal of Information & Management 24 (2004), 473–488</ref> ===Information load=== Designers of online shops should consider the effects of information load. Mehrabian and Russel (1974) introduced the concept of information rate (load) as the complex spatial and temporal arrangements of stimuli within a setting.<ref>Mehrabian, A., & Russel J.A. (1974) An Approach to Environmental Psychology. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.</ref> The notion of information load is directly related to concerns about whether consumers can be given too much information in virtual shopping environments. Compared with conventional retail shopping, computer shopping enriches the information environment of virtual shopping by providing additional product information, such as comparative products and services, as well as various alternatives and attributes of each alternative, etc.<ref name="huang">Huang, M. (2000) Information load: its relationship to online exploratory and shopping behavior. International Journal of Information Management 20: 337–347.</ref> Two major sub-dimensions have been identified for information load: complexity and novelty.<ref>Campbell, D.J. (1988) Task complexity: A review and analysis. Academy of Management Review, 13(1), 40–52.</ref> Complexity refers to the number of different elements or features of a site, which can be the result of increased information diversity. Novelty involves the unexpected, suppressing, new, or unfamiliar aspects of the site. A research by Huang (2000) showed that the novelty dimension kept consumers exploring the shopping sites, whereas the complexity dimension has the potential to induce impulse purchases.<ref name="huang" /> ===Consumer expectations=== The main idea of online [[shopping]] is not just in having a good looking [[website]] that could be listed in a lot of search engines or the art behind the site.<ref name="louisfalk">Falk, Louis K.; Sockel, Hy; Chen, Kuanchin. (2005) "E-Commerce and Consumer's Expectations: What Makes a Website Work." Journal of Website Promotion, 1(1) (65–75)</ref> It also is not only just about disseminating information, because it is also about building relationships and making money.<ref name="louisfalk" /> Mostly, [[organizations]] try to adopt techniques of online shopping without understanding these techniques and/or without a sound business model.<ref name="louisfalk" /> Rather than supporting the organization's culture and brand name, the website should satisfy consumer's expectations.<ref name="louisfalk" /> A majority of consumers choose online shopping for a faster and more efficient shopping experience. Many researchers notify that the uniqueness of the web has dissolved and the need for the design, which will be user centered, is very important.<ref name="louisfalk" /> Companies should always remember that there are certain things, such as understanding the customer's wants and needs, living up to promises, never go out of style, because they give reason to come back.<ref name="louisfalk" /> And the reason will stay if consumers always get what they expect. [[McDonaldization]] theory can be used in terms of online shopping, because online shopping is becoming more and more popular and a website that wants to gain more shoppers will use four major principles of McDonaldization: efficiency, calculability, predictability and control.
