This Diamondback was Deborah "Debbie" Bertrand. Debbie attended the University of North Carolina on an athletics scholarship, becoming an All-American Olympic athlete and gymnast. For undisclosed reasons, apparently quitting this career to try her hand as a mercenary, she purchased equipment from the [[Tinkerer]], which he had designed for Diamondback (Rachel Leighton). Perhaps hoping to use Leighton's reputation to boost her own fledgling career, Bertrand adopted the same code name, despite Leighton still being active in that identity. [[Nick Fury]] thought to himself that when Rachel found out, she would "kick the impostor's butt".<ref>''Secret War'' #3</ref> Bertrand teamed with Scorcher to attack Daredevil in his apartment.

Nick Fury then explained that the "new" Rachel was an advanced [[Life Model Decoy]], in fact so advanced as to believe itself to be human, and kept her in storage while working at a way to restore her proper programming. Before "she" could be restored, the [[Iron Maniac]] wiped out all her memories, and reshaped her body in a new neurokinetical armor for himself.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} ==Powers and abilities== Leighton is an athletic woman with no superhuman powers.
