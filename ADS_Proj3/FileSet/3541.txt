The FDF uses the MIME content type application/vnd.fdf, filename extension .fdf and on Mac OS it uses file type 'FDF '.<ref name="iso32000" /> A support for importing and exporting FDF stand-alone files is not widely implemented in free or freeware PDF software. For example, there is no support in Evince, Okular, KPDF or Sumatra PDF. Import support for stand-alone FDF files is implemented in Adobe Reader; export and import support (including saving of FDF data in PDF) is for example implemented in Foxit Reader and PDF-XChange Viewer Free; saving of FDF data in a PDF file is also supported in pdftk. =====XML Forms Data Format (XFDF)===== {{Infobox file format | name = XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) | icon = | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | extension = .xfdf | mime = application/vnd.adobe.xfdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.adobe.xfdf |title=IANA Application Media Types - Vendor Tree - vnd.adobe.xfdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref> | type code = 'XFDF' | uniform type = | magic = | owner = [[Adobe Systems]] | released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> | latest release version = 2.0 | latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> | genre = | container for = | contained by = | extended from = PDF, FDF, [[XML]] | extended to = | standard = | free = | url = [http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfdf_2.0.pdf XFDF 2.0 specification] }} XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary - such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''<ref name="xfdf" />. The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard. XFDF can be used the same way as FDF - e.g. form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. A support for importing and exporting FDF stand-alone files is not widely implemented in free or freeware PDF software. Import of XFDF is implemented in Adobe Reader 5 and later versions; import and export is implemented in PDF-XChange Viewer Free; embedding of XFDF data in PDF form is implemented in pdftk (pdf toolkit). ==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ==== {{Main|XFA|l1=XML Forms Architecture}} In the PDF 1.5 format, [[Adobe Systems]] introduced a new, proprietary format for forms, namely Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) forms. The XFA 2.02 is referenced in the PDF 1.5 specification (and also in later versions) but is described separately in ''Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification'', which has several versions.<ref name="acroforms-and-xfa" /><ref name="xfa-adobe">{{cite web |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/xml/index_arch.html |title=Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with AcroForms. Creating XFA Forms for use in Adobe Reader requires Adobe LiveCycle Forms Designer or Avoka SmartForm Composer.<ref name="acroforms-appligent" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/readerextensions/ |title=Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES2 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> Adobe Reader contains "disabled features" for use of XFA Forms, that will activate only when opening a PDF document that was created using enabling technology available only from Adobe.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.adobe.com/products/eulas/pdfs/Reader_Player_AIR_WWEULA-Combined-20080204_1313.pdf |format=PDF |title=Adobe Reader - Software license agreement |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/go/readerextensions |title=LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES features and benefits |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> The XFA Forms are not compatible with Adobe Reader prior to version 6.<ref name="acroforms-appligent" /> XFA forms can be created and used as PDF files or as XDP ([[XML Data Package]]) files. The format of an XFA resource in PDF is described by the XML Data Package Specification.<ref name="iso32000" /> The XDP may be a standalone document or it may in turn be carried inside a PDF document. XDP provides a mechanism for packaging form components within a surrounding XML container. An XDP can also package a PDF file, along with XML form and template data.<ref name="xfa-adobe" /> PDF may contain XFA (in XDP format), but also XFA may contain PDF.<ref name="xfa-adobe" /> When the XFA (XML Forms Architecture) grammars used for an XFA form are moved from one application to another, they must be packaged as an XML Data Package.<ref name="xfa25">{{citation |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfa_spec_2_5.pdf |format=PDF |title=XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification Version 2.5 |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> When the PDF and XFA are combined, the result is a form in which each page of the XFA form overlays a PDF background. This architecture is sometimes referred to as XFAF (XFA Foreground). The alternative is to express all of the form, including boilerplate, directly in XFA. It is sometimes called ''full'' XFA.<ref name="xfa25" /> Starting with PDF 1.5, the text contents of variable text form fields, as well as markup annotations may include formatting information (style information). These rich text strings are XML documents that conform to the rich text conventions specified for the XML Forms Architecture specification 2.02, which is itself a subset of the XHTML 1.0 specification, augmented with a restricted set of CSS2 style attributes.<ref name="iso32000" /> In PDF 1.6, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.2. In PDF 1.7, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.4<ref name="iso32000" /> === Logical structure and accessibility === {{Expand section|date=May 2008}} A PDF may contain structure information to enable better text extraction and accessibility.
