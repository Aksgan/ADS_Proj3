a back story along the lines of the Japanese series, with the Machine Robo mecha being used to defend Earth from the alien Devil Invaders. The Battle Suits were also issued at this stage. ==GoBots== In 1983, [[Tonka]] purchased the rights to distribute ''Machine Robo'' in America, and began refashioning it into the ''GoBot'' line. Bandai began to adapt elements of this line, notably the idea of the mecha being individual robots and naming them (generally using the GoBot names). During this phase, a wider range of figures were issued, including the Super GoBots, Puzzler and the playsets. Later on, as the animated ''[[Challenge of the GoBots]]'' series began appearing in Europe, the line went through a period of rebranding, becoming known by a variety of names, including ''Challenge of the GoBots – A Robo Machine Product'' or ''Robo Machine featuring Challenge of the Gobots''. The line began to parallel the American one more closely (with American names being used on all figures), and gradually petered out after that range failed. ==Media== ''Main Article [[Robo Machines (comic)]]'' The only true ''Robo Machines'' media produced in Europe was a [[Robo Machines (comic)|comic serial]] in the British ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' comic, which ran from 10 November 1984 to 29 July 1985. This depicted the battle between Ex-El’s Security Forces and Stron-Domez’ criminal Robo Machines. As the comic went on, GoBot terms such as [[Guardian (GoBot)|Guardian]] began to appear. The main human character, Charlie Bampton, appeared later in the series, and was shown to possess the powers of [[ESP]] and [[telekinesis]]. Later media tied in more closely with the ''Challenge of the GoBots'' continuity. ==Differences from Japanese & American Lines== * Some figures from the Japanese line were released in Europe that didn’t come out in America – three of the Double Machine Robo were issued as Combinators, while the Deluxe vehicles from Bandai’s ''[[Zenmai Kahen Winch Robo]]'' line were also issued. Both of these ranges came without individual names, thought the [[Toyota New Hi-Lux]] is often referred to as "The Winch" or "Winch Robo". * Several colour schemes were different from the American releases – figures such as [[Slicks (Gobots)|Slicks]], [[Herr Fiend]] and [[Night Ranger (Gobots)|Night Ranger]] were issued in their Japanese schemes, while several others, such as [[Gunnyr]] and [[Carry-All]] were given brand new schemes. * MR-45, the Blackbird Robo, was originally scheduled to be part of the Gobot line as the [[Renegade (Gobots)|Renegade]] [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]], but failed to appear in the toyline despite the character featuring in the [[Challenge of the Gobots|cartoon series]]. Initially the toy was released in Europe as Sky-Spy. * Bandai used the ''Robo Machine'' brand for a number of robot toys, many with minimal connection to ''Gobots'' - a motorised, [[remote control]] non-transforming Bandai robot was issued under the banner, named as the Robot Arm Machine; non-transforming remote control robot was issued as Robot Kong. Toys from the ''[[Godiakin]]'' and ''[[Dancougar]]'' lines were issued with the branding too. * Several figures were given different names to their American counterparts: {| | valign="top" | {| | '''Gobot Name'''|| '''Robo Machine Name'''|| |---- | [[Wrong Way (Gobots)|Wrong Way]]|| Sky Gun|| |---- | [[Twin Spin]]|| [[Carry-All]]|| |---- | [[Road Ranger (Gobots)|Road Ranger]]|| Truck|| |---- | [[Vamp (Gobots)|Vamp]]|| Casmodon|| |---- | [[Pincher (Gobots)|Pincher]]|| Falgos|| |---- | [[Scorp (Gobots)|Scorp]]|| Zarios|| |---- | [[Bad Boy (Gobots)|Bad Boy]]|| Tank-Bust|| |} However, later in the line these would fall in line with the American standard. * Similarly, several assortments were renamed – the Powersuits were known as Battle Suits, while the names [[Puzzler (Gobots)|Puzzler]] (combining robots) and [[Zod (Gobots)|Zod]] ('action' figures) were used as subset names. ==Revival== ''Main Article [[Robo Machines]]'' In 1993, Bandai attempted to relaunch the line as ''Robo Machines'', using toys from the ''[[Machine Robo#CG_Robo_.281993.29|Machine Robo CG Robo]]'' line, as well as some from the 1980s series. Due to all the Gobot [[trademark]]s being owned by [[Hasbro]], the figures were largely issued with designations once again, rather than names. It was not a financial success, and was cancelled after one year. {{Tonka Gobots}} [[Category:Fictional robots]] [[Category:Transforming toy robots]] [[Category:Bandai brands]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32257</id> <title>Robochrist Industries</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}} '''Robochrist Industries''' is a robotic performance art troupe most notably recognized for its performances in and around Los Angeles during the years 1997 - 2005. The performances feature large radio-controlled robots moving among and eventually destroying props and set-pieces intended to convey specific theatrical narratives. The troupe is a direct offshoot of [[Survival Research Laboratories]] and was featured briefly in "[[Coachella (2006 film)|Coachella]]", the feature-length film documenting the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. From 1993 to 1997, Christian Ristow, who would later go on to found Robochrist Industries, volunteered for the seminal robotic performance art collective [[Survival Research Laboratories]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. During these years Ristow worked on several SRL performances, contributing not only props but also, particularly in the years 1996 and 1997, robots that he had constructed. During this period Ristow also participated in several collaborative performances with another San Francisco based performance group, [[The Seemen]], including the often cited [[Hellco]] performance at the 1996 [[Burning Man]] festival. In early 1997 Ristow relocated to [[Los Angeles]] in search of film special effects work as well as fresh audiences uninitiated to the world of robot performance art. Shortly thereafter the name "Robochrist Industries" was first employed and a small group of volunteers coalesced to form a working performance group. The gradual inclusion of artistic and technical professionals from disciplines such as film special effects and the aerospace industry helped fuel larger and more frequent shows over the ensuing years. During this time there was significant crossover, both in terms of personnel and co-performing, with the performance-art/musical outfits Woodpussy and [[The Mutaytor]]. Starting in 1999 Ristow and cohorts began performing at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. The performances at the first two years of the festival, 1999 and 2001, were relataively modest, featuring only two or three robots with few props. The four performances from 2002 to 2005, however, saw greatly
