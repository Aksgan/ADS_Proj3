State University]]. In order to apply, institutions must first obtain certification by NSA of their curriculum in information security – for NSU this was accomplished in April 2004. The benefits of such certification: # NSU was added to NSA's list of referrals for students who seek training in the information security. # Federal civilian and military personnel are able to take NSU’s security courses under government sponsorship and obtain special recognition under the certification. # NSU is authorized to issue certificates using NSA’s logo to students who complete its certified courses. NSU’s proposal for the National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education had to satisfy ten NSA major criteria (including 32 sub-criteria). The major criteria are listed below: # Partnerships in IA Education # IA treated as a Multidisciplinary Science (taught within existing courses in other programs) # University Encourages the Practice of Information Assurance (NSU security policy, appointed Information Systems Security Officer) # Academic Program Encourages Research in IA (more than 15 ongoing dissertations in IA; six already completed) # IA Curriculum Reaches Beyond Geographic Borders # Faculty Active in IA Practice and Research and Contribute to IA Literature (over 30 paper in last 2 years) # State-of the-Art IA Resources (new security laboratory (SARDIS); state-of-the-art library in IA) # Declared concentrations (e.g., B.S., M.S., PhD) # Declared center (focus) for IA education/research (GSCIS) # Full-time IA Faculty Below is a very brief summary of NSU's capabilities and recent accomplishments in IA: # Academic Programs: NSU offers a master of science degree in information security, three master's degree concentrations in IA, two graduate certificate programs in IA, two Ph.D. concentrations in IA, and a range of IA courses in non-IA graduate programs (law, business, criminal justice, and medical informatics). # Research: Over the last few years, NSU faculty authored 16 papers in IA that were published in journals or presented at major technical conferences. Currently, 15 Ph.D. students are writing dissertations in IA, and graduate students have completed more than 30 IA research projects. # State-of-the-Art Resources: NSU recently created an IA laboratory to be a significant research and teaching facility. Its advanced computer system facilitates research in new IA technologies. In mid-2005, it will be connected to the Florida Lambda Rail. The laboratory is also dedicated for use in partnerships with other institutions. NSU has established an online IA repository that provides access to both historical IA material and current research material from NSU and other academic IA research centers. It also provides access to seminal IA-related documents collected at other centers of excellence and IA papers presented at major conferences. ==External links== *[http://www.scis.nova.edu Official Website] {{Nova Southeastern University}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Nova Southeastern University Graduate School Of Computer And Information Sciences}} [[Category:Nova Southeastern University]] [[Category:Computer science departments]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26726</id> <title>Novell Cloud Security Service</title> <text>{{Infobox software |name = Novell Cloud Security Service |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |collapsible = |author = |developer = [[Novell]] |released = early 2010 <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |discontinued = |latest release version = |latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |latest preview version = |latest preview date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |frequently updated = |programming language = |operating system = |platform = |size = |language = |status = |genre = [[Web application]] |license = |website = [http://www.novell.com/products/cloud-security-service/ Novell Cloud Security Service] }} '''Novell Cloud Security Service''' (NCSS) is a Web-based (SaaS) [[identity management|identity]] and [[access management]] solution, currently in private beta but scheduled for release in early 2010<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-326544.html|title=Novell aims to tighten cloud security|publisher=ZDNet|date=2009-07-30|accessdate=2010-25-1}}</ref>. NCSS allows [[SaaS]], [[PaaS]], and [[IaaS]] providers to offer their enterprise customers the ability to deploy their existing identity infrastructure in the [[cloud computing|cloud]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crn.com/software/222000865|title=Novell To Unveil Strategy For Cloud Computing, Virtualization|publisher=CRN|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>. ==Core Functionality== At the core of NCSS is the Cloud Security Broker, a collection of cloud elements that work together to provide a secure place for cloud workloads and cloud [[computer data storage|storage]]. SaaS and PaaS platforms access the Security Broker via identity and event connectors provided by NCSS, while the enterprise accesses the broker via an on-premise secure bridge run from the [[data center]]. This secure bridge, which is [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] friendly, provides a protocol proxy, policy agent, audit agent, secure communication manager and key agent. The broker ensures that sensitive information always remains behind the firewall. ==How It Works== When an enterprise engages a SaaS provider that uses Novell Cloud Security Service, a user at that enterprise will either log on to the service directly or via the enterprise’s existing identity systems. A "Cloud Security Broker" will then verify the identity of the user. If the user is valid, the broker generates and passes an identity token in the format requested by the cloud provider. NCSS supports multiple industry standards and identity management systems enabling different SaaS vendors to connect to different enterprise identity systems easily. NCSS also provides connectors on the SaaS provider side that provide deep [[audit log|audit tracking logs]] that enterprises can use for compliance purposes. ==Additional Features== NCSS features a graphical dashboard interface for providers and their customers to easily manage all their connections via a single unified interface. It also includes a [[key management]] functionality that maintains the cryptographic keys necessary for communication between the various components. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.novell.com/connectionmagazine/2010/01/novell_cloud_security_service.html/"Annexing the Cloud"] *[http://www.novell.com/products/cloud-security-service// NCSS Web Page] {{Novell}} [[Category:Novell]] [[Category:Novell software]] [[Category:Upcoming products|Software]] [[Category:Web applications]] [[Category:Cloud computing]] [[Category:Computer security]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26729</id> <title>Novell NetWare</title> <text>{{Lead too short|date=October 2009}} {{Infobox OS | name = Novell NetWare | logo = | screenshot = [[Image:NetWare console screenshot.png|250px|The NetWare console screen]] | caption = The NetWare console screen (August 22, 2006) | developer = [[Novell, Inc.]] | source_model = [[Closed source]] | kernel_type = [[Hybrid kernel]] | supported_platforms = | ui = [[Command line interface]] | family = | released = 1983 | latest_release_version = 6.5 SP8 | latest_release_date = May 6, 2009 | latest_test_version = | latest_test_date = | marketing_target = | programmed_in = | prog_language = | language = [[English language|English]] | updatemodel =
