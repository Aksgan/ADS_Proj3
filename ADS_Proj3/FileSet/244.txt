tool developed by XJ Technologies. ==History of AnyLogic== In the beginning of 1990s there was a big interest in the mathematical approach to modeling and simulation of parallel processes. This approach may be applied to the analysis of correctness of parallel and distributed programs. The Distributed Computer Network (DCN) research group at Saint Petersburg Technical University developed such a software system for the analysis of program correctness; the new tool was named COVERS (Concurrent Verification and Simulation). This system allowed graphical modeling notation for system structure and behavior. The tool was applied for the research granted by Hewlett Packard (?). In 1998 the success of this research inspired the DCN laboratory to organize a company with a mission to develop a new age simulation software. The emphasis in the development was placed on applied methods: simulation, performance analysis, behavior of stochastic systems, optimization and visualization. New software released in 2000 was based on the latest advantages of information technologies: an object-oriented approach, elements of the UML standard, the use of Java, a modern GUI, etc. [[Image:Different simulation methods.JPG|thumb | 500px| right |Three business simulation approaches]] The tool was named AnyLogic, because it supported all three well-known modeling approaches: * [[System dynamics]], * [[Discrete event simulation]], * [[Agent-based model]]ing<ref>Cynthia Nikolai, Gregory Madey.

These applets make AnyLogic models very easy to share or place on websites. In addition to Java applets the Professional version allows for the creation of Java runtime applications which can be distributed to users. These pure Java applications can be a base for decision support tools<ref>Christian Wartha, Momtchil Peev, Andrei Borshchev, Alexei Filippov.

System dynamics and discrete event are traditional simulation approaches, agent based is new. Technically, the system dynamics approach deals mostly with continuous processes whereas "discrete event" (by which we mean all descendants of [[GPSS]] also known as process-centric simulation approach) and agent based models work mostly in discrete time, i.e. jump from one event to another. System dynamics and discrete event simulation historically have been taught at universities to very different groups of students, namely [[management]] and [[economy]], industrial and [[Operations research|operation research]] engineers. As a result,
