geometric, but it had a topological gap, filled by [[Alexander Ostrowski]] in 1920, as discussed in Smale 1981. A rigorous proof was published by [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]] in 1806; it was here that, for the first time, the fundamental theorem of algebra was stated for polynomials with complex coefficients, rather than just real coefficients. Gauss produced two other proofs in 1816 and another version of his original proof in 1849. The first textbook containing a proof of the theorem was [[Cauchy]]'s ''Cours d'analyse de l'École Royale Polytechnique'' (1821). It contained Argand's proof, although [[Jean Robert Argand|Argand]] is not credited for it. None of the proofs mentioned so far is [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]]. It was [[Weierstrass]] who raised for the first time, in the middle of the 19th century, the problem of finding a [[constructive proof]] of the fundamental theorem of algebra. He presented his solution, that amounts in modern terms to a combination of the [[Durand–Kerner method]] with the [[Homotopy|homotopy continuation principle]], in 1891. Another proof of this kind was obtained by [[Hellmuth Kneser]] in 1940 and simplified by his son [[Martin Kneser]] in 1981. Without using [[countable choice]], it is not possible to constructively prove the fundamental theorem of algebra for complex numbers based on the [[construction of the real numbers|Dedekind real numbers]] (which are not constructively equivalent to the Cauchy real numbers without countable choice<ref>For the minimum necessary to prove their equivalence, see Bridges, Schuster, and Richman; 1998; <cite>A weak countable choice principle</cite>; available from [http://www.math.fau.edu/richman/HTML/DOCS.HTM].</ref>). However, [[Fred Richman]] proved a reformulated version of the theorem that does work.<ref>See Fred Richman; 1998; <cite>The fundamental theorem of algebra: a constructive development without choice</cite>; available from [http://www.math.fau.edu/richman/HTML/DOCS.HTM].</ref> ==Proofs== All proofs below involve some [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], at the very least the concept of [[continuous function|continuity]] of real or complex functions. Some also use [[Derivative|differentiable]] or even [[Analytic function|analytic]] functions. This fact has led some to remark that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is neither fundamental, nor a theorem of algebra. Some proofs of the theorem only prove that any non-constant polynomial with real coefficients has some complex root. This is enough to establish the theorem in the general case because, given a non-constant polynomial ''p''(''z'') with complex coefficients, the polynomial :<math>q(z)=p(z)\overline{p(\overline z)}</math> has only real coefficients and, if ''z'' is a zero of ''q''(''z''), then either ''z'' or its conjugate is a root of ''p''(''z''). A large number of non-algebraic proofs of the theorem use the fact (sometimes called “growth lemma”) that an ''n''-th degree polynomial function ''p''(''z'') whose dominant coefficient is 1 behaves like ''z<sup>n</sup>'' when |''z''| is large enough. A more precise statement is: there is some positive real number ''R'' such that: :<math>\tfrac{1}{2}|z^n|<|p(z)|<\tfrac{3}{2}|z^n|</math> when |''z''| > ''R''. ===Complex-analytic proofs=== Find a closed [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] ''D'' of radius ''r'' centered at the origin such that |''p''(''z'')| > |''p''(0)| whenever |''z''| ≥ ''r''. The minimum of |''p''(''z'')| on ''D'', which must exist since ''D'' is [[compact set|compact]], is therefore achieved at some point ''z''<sub>0</sub> in the interior of ''D'', but not at any point of its boundary. The [[Maximum modulus principle|minimum modulus principle]] implies then that ''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>) = 0. In other words, ''z''<sub>0</sub> is a zero of ''p''(''z''). '''A variation of this proof''' that does not require the use of the minimum modulus principle (most of whose proofs in turn require the use of [[Cauchy's integral theorem]] or some of its consequences) is based on the observation that for the special case of a polynomial function, the minimum modulus principle can be proved directly using elementary arguments. More precisely, if we assume by contradiction that <math>a:=p(z_0) \neq 0</math>, then, expanding <math>p(z)</math> in powers of <math>z-z_0</math> we can write :<math> p(z) = a + c_k (z-z_0)^k + c_{k+1} (z-z_0)^{k+1} + \ldots + c_n (z-z_0)^n. </math> Here, the <math>c_j</math>'s are simply the coefficients of the polynomial <math>z\to p(z+z_0)</math>, and we let <math>k</math> be the index of the first coefficient following the constant term that is non-zero. But now we see that for <math>z</math> sufficiently close to <math>z_0</math> this has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial <math>q(z) = a+c_k (z-z_0)^k</math>, in the sense that (as is easy to check) the function <math> \left|\frac{p(z)-q(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}\right| </math> is bounded by some positive constant <math>M</math> in some neighborhood of <math>z_0</math>. Therefore if we define <math>\theta_0 = (\arg(a)+\pi-\arg(c_k)) /k</math> and let <math>z = z_0 + r e^{i \theta_0}</math>, then for any sufficiently small positive number <math>r</math> (so that the bound <math>M</math> mentioned above holds), using the triangle inequality we see that :<math>\begin{align} |p(z)| &< |q(z)| + r^{k+1} \left|\frac{p(z)-q(z)}{r^{k+1}}\right|\\[.2em] &\le \left|a +(-1)c_k r^k e^{ i(\arg(a)-\arg(c_k))}\right| + M r^{k+1} \\[.5em] &= |a|-|c_k|r^k + M r^{k+1}. \end{align}</math> When ''r'' is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for |''p''(''z'')| is strictly smaller than |''a''|, in contradiction to the definition of ''z''<sub>0</sub>. (Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction θ<sub>0</sub> such that if one approaches ''z''<sub>0</sub> from that direction one can obtain values ''p''(''z'') smaller in absolute value than |''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>)|.) '''Another''' analytic proof can be obtained along this line of thought observing that, since |''p''(''z'')| > |''p''(0)| outside ''D'', the minimum of |''p''(''z'')| on the whole complex plane is achieved at ''z''<sub>0</sub>. If |''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>)| > 0, then 1/''p'' is a bounded [[holomorphic function]] in the entire complex plane since, for each complex number ''z'', |1/''p''(''z'')| ≤ |1/''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>)|. Applying [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], which states that a bounded entire function must be constant, this would imply that 1/''p'' is constant and therefore that ''p'' is constant. This gives a contradiction, and hence ''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>) = 0. '''Yet another''' analytic proof uses the [[argument principle]]. Let ''R'' be a positive real number large enough so that every root of ''p''(''z'') has absolute value smaller than ''R''; such a number must exist because every non-constant polynomial function of degree ''n'' has at most ''n'' zeros. For each ''r'' > ''R'', consider the number :<math>\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c(r)}\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}\,dz,</math> where ''c''(''r'') is the circle centered at 0 with radius ''r'' oriented counterclockwise; then the [[argument principle]] says that this number is the number ''N'' of zeros of ''p''(''z'') in the
