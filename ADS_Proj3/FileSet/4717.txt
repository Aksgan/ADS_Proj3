capable of working on 32-bit image data as opposed to Voodoo2's pure 16-bit output. Avenger's other remarkable features included the 128-bit [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI accelerator]] first debuted in Banshee. This 2D engine led the Voodoo3 to be considered one of the more high-performance video cards of its generation.<ref>Fastsite.

[http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=923 3dfx Voodoo3], Anandtech, April 3, 1999.</ref> The Voodoo3 2000, 3000 and 3500 differed mainly in clock frequencies (memory and core were synchronous). The clock rates were 143 [[Hertz|MHz]], 166 MHz and 183 MHz respectively. While this gave the 3000 and 3500 a notable theoretical advantage in multi-textured fillrate over its main rival, the 125 MHz TNT2,the TNT2 had nearly twice the single-textured fillrate of the Voodoo3. In addition, the Voodoo3 consisted of one multi-texturing pipeline, the TNT series consisted of twin single texturing pipelines.<ref>[http://www.beyond3d.com/misc/chipcomp/ Beyond3D 3D Chip Tables], Beyond3D.Com, accessed August 30, 2006.</ref> As a result, Voodoo3 was disadvantaged in games not using multiple texturing. The 2000 and 3000 boards generally differed in their support for TV output; the 3500 boards also carried a TV tuner and provided a wide range of video inputs and outputs. At the time modern multi-texturing games such as [[Quake3]] and [[Unreal Tournament]] were considered Voodoo3's performance territory, as Voodoo3's primary competition upon release was the dated RIVA TNT.<ref name=AnandVoodoo3 /> NVIDIA's RIVA TNT2 arrived shortly thereafter and the two traded places frequently in benchmark results.<ref>Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=940 NVIDIA Riva TNT2], Anandtech, April 27, 1999.</ref> Voodoo3 remained performance competitive throughout its life, eventually being comprehensively outclassed by NVIDIA's [[GeForce 256]] and ATI's [[Radeon R100|Radeon]]. 3dfx created the ill-fated [[Voodoo 5]] to counter. ==3dfx Velocity== 3dfx released a line of business / value-oriented cards based on the Voodoo3 Avenger chipset. With the purchase of STB Technologies, 3dfx had acquired several popular brand names. The Velocity brand had appealed to OEM system builders for years, with boards such as the [[S3 Graphics]] [[S3 ViRGE|ViRGE VX]]-based ''STB Velocity 3D'' and [[NVIDIA]] [[RIVA 128]]-based ''Velocity 128'' being used in many OEM systems from companies such as [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]]. The 3dfx Velocity boards came with only 8 MiB of RAM, compared to 16 MiB on a regular Voodoo3. In addition, one of the texture management units came disabled as well, making the board more like a Banshee. Enthusiasts discovered that it was possible to enable the disabled TMU with a simple registry alteration. The board's clock speed was set at 143 MHz, exactly the same as a Voodoo3 2000.<ref>Andrawes, Mike.
