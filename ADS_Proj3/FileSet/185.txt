In 2006, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating "''Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer''".<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,8-c,systems/article.html PC World, The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time]</ref> Following the A1000, Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. However, the best selling models were the budget models, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.<ref>[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a500plus.html Commodore Amiga 500+]</ref> The [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]] launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success. Commodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Though discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe. Following purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity. Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52's]]. Early A500 units, at least, had the words "B52/ROCK LOBSTER"<ref>[http://www.rollerfink.de/wp-content/rollerfink.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/img_1518.JPG RollerFink.de]</ref> [[Printed circuit board#Manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the popular song "[[Rock Lobster]]" The [[Amiga 600]] referenced "JUNE BUG" (after the song "Junebug") and the [[Amiga 1200]] had "CHANNEL Z" (after "[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]").<ref>{{cite web |last =Knight |first =Gareth |author-link = |last2 = |first2 = |author2-link = |title =References to B52 songs on Amiga Motherboards |date = |year =1997-2006 |url =http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/b52board.html |accessdate =2008-05-20 |postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> === AmigaOS
