technology=== [[Image:Rwheadmacro.jpg|thumb|right|A read/write head from a circa-1998 Fujitsu 3.5-inch hard disk. The area pictured is approximately 2.0 mm x 3.0mm.]] [[Image:Rwheadmicro.JPG|thumb|right|[[Micrograph|Microphotograph]] of an older generation hard disk head and slider (1990s). The size of the front face (which is the "trailing face" of the slider) is about 0.3 mm × 1.0 mm. It is the location of the actual head (magnetic sensors). The non-visible bottom face of the slider is about 1.0 mm × 1.25 mm (so-called "nano" size) and faces the platter. It contains the lithographically micro-machined air bearing surface (ABS) that allows the slider to fly in a highly controlled fashion. One functional part of the head is the round, orange structure visible in the middle—the [[photolithography|lithographically]] defined copper coil of the write [[transducer]]. Also note the electric connections by wires bonded to gold-plated pads.]] Modern HDDs prevent power interruptions or other malfunctions from landing its heads in the data zone by '''parking''' the heads either in a '''landing zone''' or by unloading (i.e., '''load/unload''') the heads. Some early PC HDDs did not park the heads automatically and they would land on data. In some other early units the user manually parked the heads by running a program to park the HDD's heads. A '''landing zone''' is an area of the platter usually near its inner diameter (ID), where no data are stored. This area is called the Contact Start/Stop (CSS) zone. Disks are designed such that either a [[spring (device)|spring]] or, more recently, rotational [[inertia]] in the platters is used to park the heads in the case of unexpected power loss. In this case, the [[brushless DC electric motor|spindle motor]] temporarily acts as a [[electrical generator|generator]], providing power to the actuator. Spring tension from the head mounting constantly pushes the heads towards the platter. While the disk is spinning, the heads are supported by an air bearing and experience no physical contact or wear. In CSS drives the sliders carrying the head sensors (often also just called ''heads'') are designed to survive a number of landings and takeoffs from the media surface, though wear and tear on these microscopic components eventually takes its toll. Most manufacturers design the sliders to survive 50,000 contact cycles before the chance of damage on startup rises above 50%. However, the decay rate is not linear: when a disk is younger and has had fewer start-stop cycles, it has a better chance of surviving the next startup than an older, higher-mileage disk (as the head literally drags along the disk's surface until the air bearing is established). For example, the Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 series of desktop hard disks are rated to 50,000 start-stop cycles, in other words no failures attributed to the head-platter interface were seen before at least 50,000 start-stop cycles during testing.<ref>[http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/manuals/sata/100402371a.pdf Barracuda 7200.10 Serial ATA Product Manual]</ref> Around 1995 IBM pioneered a technology where a landing zone on the disk is made by a precision laser process (''Laser Zone Texture'' = LZT) producing an array of smooth nanometer-scale "bumps" in a landing zone,<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=490199 IEEE.org], Baumgart, P.; Krajnovich, D.J.; Nguyen, T.A.; Tam, A.G.; IEEE Trans. Magn.</ref> thus vastly improving [[stiction]] and wear performance. This technology is still largely in use today (2008), predominantly in desktop and enterprise (3.5 inch) drives. In general, CSS technology can be prone to increased stiction (the tendency for the heads to stick to the platter surface), e.g. as a consequence of increased humidity. Excessive stiction can cause physical damage to the platter and slider or spindle motor. '''Load/Unload''' technology relies on the heads being lifted off the platters into a safe location, thus eliminating the risks of wear and stiction altogether. The first HDD [[IBM 305 RAMAC|RAMAC]] and most early disk drives used complex mechanisms to load and unload the heads. Modern HDDs use ramp loading, first introduced by [[Memorex]] in 1967,<ref>Pugh et al.; "IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems"; MIT Press, 1991, pp.270</ref> to load/unload onto plastic "ramps" near the outer disk edge. All HDDs today still use one of these two technologies listed above. Each has a list of advantages and drawbacks in terms of loss of storage area on the disk, relative difficulty of mechanical tolerance control, non-operating shock robustness, cost of implementation, etc. Addressing shock robustness, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] also created a technology for their [[ThinkPad]] line of laptop computers called the Active Protection System. When a sudden, sharp movement is detected by the built-in [[accelerometer]] in the Thinkpad, internal hard disk heads automatically unload themselves to reduce the risk of any potential data loss or scratch defects. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] later also utilized this technology in their [[PowerBook]], [[iBook]], [[MacBook Pro]], and [[MacBook]] line, known as the [[Sudden Motion Sensor]].

Do not change it. --> Most major hard disk and motherboard vendors now support [[S.M.A.R.T.]] (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), which measures drive characteristics such as [[operating temperature]], spin-up time, data error rates, etc. Certain trends and sudden changes in these parameters are thought to be associated with increased likelihood of drive failure and data loss. However, not all failures are predictable. Normal use eventually can lead to a breakdown in the inherently fragile device, which makes it essential for the user to periodically back up the data onto a separate storage device. Failure to do so can lead to the loss of data. While it may sometimes be possible to recover lost information, it is normally an extremely costly procedure, and it is not possible to guarantee success. A 2007 study published by [[Google]] suggested very little correlation between failure rates and either high temperature or
