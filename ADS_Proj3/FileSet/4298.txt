The system is called '''Canberra Automated Traffic Signal System''' ('''CATSS''') in [[Canberra]]. In total, about 23,000 intersections in over 100 countries use the system. In Australia, the majority of signalised intersections are SCATS operated (around 11,000). The system uses [[traffic camera]]s or [[Radio-frequency induction|induction]] loops installed within the road pavement to count vehicles at each intersection, and adapts the timing of traffic signals in the network through a centralised [[Data center|datacentre]]. Detailed signal diagnostics are also passed to the datacentre, with the ability to notify staff when a traffic signal has a fault. A SCATS system is able to operate over [[Permitted Attached Private Lines|PAPL]], [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] or [[Public Switched Telephone Network|PSTN]] network connections to each intersection. While SCATS is a recognised worldwide market leader in intelligent transport systems, the New South Wales [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] is continuing to develop SCATS and has also entered into collaborative research and development agreements in order to progress research on a number of longer term improvements to managing traffic. '''Hong Kong'''<br /> In Hong Kong, SCATS is currently adopted in the area traffic control systems at Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, Tsuen Wan and Shatin.
