of water and fat). For example, whereas MRI can tell doctors where a [[tumour]] ([[cancer]]) is located within a patient's body, MRS can, in theory, tell them how aggressive (malignant) the tumour is. MRS equipment can be tuned (just like a [[radio]] receiver) to pick up signals from different [[NMR#Isotopes|chemical nuclei]] within the body. The most common nuclei to be studied are [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]]), [[phosphorus]], [[carbon]], [[sodium]] and [[fluorine]]. The types of biochemicals ([[Metabolomics|metabolites]]) which can be studied include [[choline]]-containing compounds (which are used to make [[Cell (biology)|cell]] membranes), [[creatine]] (a chemical involved in energy [[metabolism]]), [[inositol]] and [[glucose]] (both [[sugar]]s), [[N-Acetylaspartate|N-acetyl aspartate]] (a chemical associated with the [[myelin]] sheaths of [[axon|nerve cell]] fibres), and [[alanine]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] which are elevated in some [[tumor]]s. At present MRS is mainly used as a tool by [[scientist]]s (e.g. [[Medical physics|medical physicists]] and [[Biochemistry|biochemists]]) for [[medical research]] projects, but it is becoming clear that it also has the ability to give [[Physician|doctors]] useful [[clinic]]al information which can be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of disease. MRS is currently used to investigate a number of [[disease]]s in the [[human body]], most notably [[cancer]] (in [[brain]], [[breast]] and [[prostate]]), [[epilepsy]], [[Alzheimer's Disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Huntington's Chorea]]. ==Example== Shown below is an MRI brain scan (in the [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Planes|axial]] plane, that is slicing from front-to-back and side-to-side through the [[head]]) showing a brain tumour ([[meningioma]]) at the bottom right. The red box shows the volume of interest from which chemical information was obtained by MRS (a cube with 2 cm sides which produces a square when intersecting the 5 mm thick slice of the MRI scan). The [[proton]] MRS [[spectrum]] from this tumour is also shown (as acquired with a 1.5 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] whole-body [[MRI|MRI scanner]]). The horizontal [[Cartesian Coordinate System|axis]] is NMR [[frequency]] (or [[chemical shift]] in parts per million, p.p.m., relative to a [[Chemical shift|reference chemical]] at 0 p.p.m. rather than in the absolute units of [[hertz]]) and the vertical axis is signal strength (in arbitrary units). Each biochemical, or metabolite, has a different peak in the spectrum which appears at a known frequency. The peaks corresponding to the amino acid [[alanine]], are highlighted in red (at 1.4 p.p.m). This is an example of the kind of biochemical information which can help doctors to make their [[diagnosis]]. Other metabolites of note are [[choline]] (3.2 p.p.m.) and [[creatine]] (3.0 p.p.m.).

The vulnerability arises by allowing unchecked user data to be passed to include directives in scripting languages, such as [[PHP]]. ==A PHP example== In PHP, <code>include()</code>, <code>require()</code> and similar [[subroutine|functions]] may allow the application developer to include an external PHP script in the running script. If it is possible for the user to control [[parameter (computer science)|arguments]] to the include function, it may be possible for a malicious user to direct the vulnerable script to execute arbitrary code on the host server, allowing complete control of PHP execution on the host server. The proper solution to this vulnerability is to modify the vulnerable code in order to prevent user control of file include directives. A PHP include vulnerability may be partially mitigated in some cases by using PHP's allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include options in an effort to limit file inclusion to local files, but this may be evaded in some cases (e.g. by including Apache's logfile which may contain arbitrary PHP code). ==See also== * [[Server Side Includes]] * [[Remote File Inclusion]] [[Category:Servers]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Include Vulnerability}} {{Compsci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>18105</id> <title>Independence system</title> <text>In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, an '''independence system''' ''S'' is a pair (''E'', '''I'''), where ''E'' is a finite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and '''I''' is a collection of [[subset]]s of ''E'' (called the '''independent sets''') with the following properties: # The [[empty set]] is independent, i.e., ∅ ∈ '''I'''. (Alternatively, at least one subset of ''E'' is independent, i.e., '''I''' ≠ ∅.) # Every subset of an independent set is independent, i.e., for each ''E' '' ⊆ ''E'', ''E'' ∈ '''I''' → ''E' '' ∈ '''I'''. This is sometimes called the '''hereditary property'''. Adding the '''augmentation property''' or the '''independent set exchange property''' yields a [[matroid]].

Computation is an area in which indeterminacy is becoming increasingly important because of the massive increase in concurrency due to networking and the advent of [[Multi-core processor|many-core]] computer architectures. These computer systems make use of [[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiters]] which give rise to [[indeterminacy]]. ==A limitation of logic programming== [[Patrick J.
