The function of this new super race would not be to dominate others but to lead [[Human race|humanity]] toward [[world peace]].<ref>Satprem. ''Sri Aurobindo, or The Adventure of Consciousness''. 1968.</ref> According to Sri Aurobindo, the central theme of Integral Yoga<ref>[http://www.sriaurobindosociety.org.in/sriauro/aurovsn.htm See www.sriaurobindosociety.org.in]</ref> is the evolution of life into a "life divine". In Sri Aurobindo’s words: "Man is a transitional being. He is not final. The step from man to [[superman]] is the next approaching achievement in the earth evolution. It is inevitable because it is at once the intention of the inner spirit and the logic of Nature's process".{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Sri Aurobindo’s disciple [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] established a [[ashram]]-[[city]] called [[Auroville]] in [[Viluppuram district]] in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] near [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]] in [[South India]] in 1968 to train and develop this new super-race through yogic practices.<ref>[http://www.boloji.com/architecture/00053.htm Roger Anger as architect]</ref><ref>[http://www.architectureweek.com/2005/1116/culture_1-1.html Auroville founded by Mira Richards]</ref><ref>[http://www.auroville.info/ACUR/templates/avfuture.htm Mirra Alfassa as other name]</ref> According to Aurobindo, "The supramental transformation is the final stage in the integral yoga, enabling the birth of a new individual fully formed by the supramental power. Such individuals would be the forerunners of a new truth-consciousness based supra-humanity. All aspects of division and ignorance of consciousness at the vital and mental levels would be overcome, replaced with a unity of consciousness at every plane, and even the physical body transformed and divinised. A new supramental species would then emerge, living a supramental, [[gnostic being|gnostic, divine life]] on earth".<ref>[[Aurobindo Ghose|Sri Aurobindo]]. ''The Life Divine'', book II, ch.27-28.</ref> On January 1, 1969, Sri Aurobindo’s Integral yoga co-worker and disciple, The Mother (at age 90) announced the "arrival" of the "superman consciousness" – "the intermediary between man and the supramental being".<ref>The Mother's Agenda, 1969, Volume 10: from January 1, 1969.</ref> ==Transhumans== {{main|Transhumanism}} {{primary sources|section|date=December 2010}} In 2005, the [[inventor]] and [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] predicted that over a 40 year period between 2005 and 2045, most human beings will gradually evolve into a super race of [[Immortality|immortal]] [[androids]] called ''[[Transhuman]]s'' with super-bodies and super-brains (the super brains of the humanoid androids will have greater capacity not only in and of themselves, but also because they will be able to function more efficiently by storing some of their mental capacity in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]] of the future greatly expanded [[Internet]] through [[brain-computer interface|brain-computer interfacing]]) by gradually replacing their [[Cell (biology)|biological cells]] with new cells having a more efficient [[Adenosine triphosphate|cellular energy processing system]] that will be based on [[nanobot]]s manufactured using [[nanotechnology]]. These nanobot based cells will enable those who possess these initially quasi android bodies ("Human body 2.0") to have much greater physical endurance as if they were permanently on [[steroid]]s, and many [[Olympic records]] will be routinely broken. The [[five senses]] will be enhanced first by [[genetic enhancement]] and then by additional brain-computer interfacing. By about 2040, most humans will have become fully android ("Human body 3.0"). Finally, predicts Kurzweil, by 2045, because of the operation of [[Moore's law]], [[supercomputer]]s linked together by the [[Internet]] will have developed enough [[Memory (computers)|memory capacity]] such that most of the now mostly android human race (except those who don’t want to) will be able to upload themselves into the worldwide Internet supercomputer of 2045 and live forever after in [[virtual reality]]—an event he calls the ''[[Singularity (technological)|Singularity]]''.<ref name=Kurzweil>Kurzweil, Ray. ''The Singularity is Near''. 2005.</ref> Kurzweil predicts that soon after the "Singularity", the worldwide supercomputer will deploy other humanoid androids and [[robot]]s in the [[meat world]]. A [[space navy]] of these androids and robots will radiate outward from Earth (by now itself a gigantic worldwide [[supercomputer]], except for extensive areas of the surface of Earth set up as [[nature reserve]]s for those humans who wanted to remain in their natural state as well as to preserve the [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s in their natural [[ecosystem]]s) on large fleets of [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary spaceships]] that will rocket outward into the [[Solar System|solar system]] and convert all the matter they encounter into [[megacomputer]]s made of [[computronium]] (such as [[Jupiter Brain]]s) in order to continually expand the [[Computer capacity measurements|computer capacity]] of the solar system. This will make possible the creation of ever more realistic virtual reality and the solution of ever more [[Computational complexity theory|complex computer problems]]. Once the matter of the solar system has been mostly converted to computer substrate, forming a [[Matrioshka brain]], according to Kurzweil, [[life]] will then expand outward into [[interstellar space]] in all directions, deploying miniature [[starship]]s (to save on expensive [[anti matter]] starship fuel) that will be [[Von Neumann probes]] crewed by [[swarm]]s of [[nanobot]]s, to colonize the entire Milky Way Galaxy. When these nanobots arrive in a [[planetary system]], the nanobots will be programmed with [[software]] to begin converting some of the matter they encounter into more androids and robots. While in the process of doing so, they will continue converting all other matter they encounter not being used to create additional androids and robots into more megacomputers--the androids and robots created by the nanobots will build interplanetary spaceships to fan out into the planetary system and themselves help get this job done. Some of the androids and robots will then settle
