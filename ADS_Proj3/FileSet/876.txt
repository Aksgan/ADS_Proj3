Each school of ethics influences a situation in a certain direction and pushes the final outcome of an [[ethical dilemma]] to fit its target schema. Modern computer ethic has built its foundation from [[Relativism]] , [[Kantianism]] , [[Utilitarianism]] , and [[Social Contract]] and continues to intertwine with modern ethical theory. [[Relativism]] is the understanding that there are no universal moral norms of right and wrong. In the school of relativistic ethical belief, ethicists divide it into two connected but different structures, subject (Moral) and culture (Anthropological). [[Moral relativism]] is the idea that each person decides what is right and wrong for them. [[Anthropological relativism]] is the concept of right and wrong is decided by a society’s actual moral belief structure. [[Kantianism]] is the belief that people’s actions are to be guided by moral laws, and that these moral laws are universal. [[Kantianism]] is the name given to the ethical theory of German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. He believed that in order for any ethical school of thought to apply to all rational beings, they must have a foundation in reason. Kant split this school into two categorical imperatives. The first categorical imperative states to act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws. The second categorical imperative states to act so that you always treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves, and never only as a means to an end. [[Utilitarianism]] is the belief that if an action is good if it benefits someone and an action is bad if it harms someone. This ethical belief can be broken down into two different schools, [[Act Utilitarianism]] and [[Rule Utilitarianism]]. [[Act Utilitarianism]] is the belief that an action is good if its overall affect is to produce more happiness than unhappiness. [[Rule Utilitarianism]] is the belief that we should adopt a moral rule and if followed by everybody, would lead to a greater level of overall happiness. [[Social contract]] is the concept that for a society to arise and maintain order, a morality based set of rules must be agreed upon. Social contract theory has influenced modern government and is heavily involved with societal law. Philosophers like [[John Rawls]] , [[Thomas Hobbes]] , [[John Locke]] , and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] helped created the function foundation of [[social contract]] . The conceptual foundations of computer ethics are investigated by [[information ethics]], a branch of philosophical [[ethics]] established by [[Luciano Floridi]]. The term computer ethics was first coined by Dr. Walter Maner, a professor at [[Bowling Green State University]]. Since the 1990s the field has started being integrated into professional development programs in academic settings. ==Identifying issues== Identifying ''ethical'' issues as
