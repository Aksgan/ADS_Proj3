During World War II, Michie worked for the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS)|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]], contributing to the effort to solve "[[Lorenz SZ 40/42|Tunny]]," a German teleprinter cipher. ==Early life and career== Michie was born in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]].<ref name="cv">{{cite web | first=Donald | last=Michie | url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~dm/dmcv.html | title=Curriculum Vitae | accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> He attended [[Rugby School]] and won a scholarship to study [[classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. In Spring 1943, however, looking for some way to contribute to the war effort, Michie instead attempted to enroll on a Japanese language course in [[Bedford]] for intelligence officers. On arrival, it transpired that the course was full, and instead he trained in cryptography, displaying a natural aptitude for the subject. Six weeks later, he was recruited to [[Bletchley Park]] and was assigned to the "[[Testery]]," a section which tackled a German teleprinter cipher.<ref name="budiansky">{{Cite book | first=Stephen | last=Budiansky | title=Colossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers | pages=52–63 | editor=B. Jack Copeland | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2006}}</ref> During his time at Bletchley Park he worked with [[Alan Turing]] and [[I. J. Good|Jack Good]]. ==Postwar research== Between 1945 and 1952 he studied at Balliol College, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; he received his [[DPhil]], in mammalian [[genetics]], in 1953.<ref name="cv"/> In 1960, he developed the ''Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine'' (MENACE), one of the first programs capable of learning to play a perfect game of [[Tic-Tac-Toe]]. Since computers were not readily available at this time, Michie implemented his program with about 300 matchboxes, each representing a unique board state. Each matchbox was filled with colored beads, each representing a different move in that board state. The quantity of a color indicated the "certainty" that playing the corresponding move would lead to a win. The program was trained by playing hundreds of games and updating the quantities of beads in each matchbox depending on the outcome of each game. Michie was director of the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception (previously the Experimental Programming Unit) from its establishment in 1965. The machine intelligence unit predated the university's computer science unit. He remained at Edinburgh until 1985,<ref>[http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/about/Michie.pdf Special Minute of Senatus, University of Edinburgh, 23rd Jan., 1985]</ref> when he left to found the Turing Institute in Glasgow. Active in the research community into his eighties, he devoted the last decade of his life to the UK charity The Human Computer Learning Foundation, and worked with Stephen Muggleton, [[Claude Sammut]], Richard Wheeler, and others on natural language systems and theories of intelligence. In 2007 he was completing a series of scientific articles on the Sophie Natural Language System and a book manuscript entitled "Jehovah's Creatures". Michie invented the [[memoization]] technique.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Memo functions: a language feature with 'rote-learning' properties. | other=Research Memorandum MIP-R-29 | location=Edinburgh | publisher=Department of Machine Intelligence & Perception | year=1967}}</ref> He was involved in many different groups during his lifetime. He was a: *Fellow of the [[British Computer Society]]; *Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]; *Honorary Fellow of the American [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]; *Honorary Fellow of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences. *Founder and Treasurer of the Human-Computer Learning Foundation, a charity registered in the UK.<ref>[http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~dm/dm.html Donald Michie<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Personal life== He was married three times, the second to biologist [[Anne McLaren]] from 1952 to 1959. He had four children, one by his first wife, and three by Prof. McLaren, including economist [[Jonathan Michie]] and health psychologist [[Susan Fiona Dorinthea Michie]]. Michie and McLaren remained friends after their divorce, and became close again after the death of his third wife. Michie aged 83 and his ex-wife McLaren died in a car crash on July 7, 2007 whilst they were travelling from Cambridge to London.<ref name="bbcobit" /> ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~dm/ Academic home page] * [http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/dictionary/detail.asp?guid=&searchtype=1&DicID=17027&RefType=Encyclopedia Biography] at SmartComputing *[http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/famousperson/michie/2598145 Donald Michie - Obituary and Tribute] *{{MathGenealogy|id=102659}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Michie, Donald | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = November 11, 1923 | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]] | DATE OF DEATH = July 7, 2007 | PLACE OF DEATH = [[England]] }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Michie, Donald}} [[Category:1923 births]] [[Category:2007 deaths]] [[Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh]] [[Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford]] [[Category:British computer scientists]] [[Category:Fellows of the British Computer Society]] [[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] [[Category:History of artificial intelligence]] [[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]] [[Category:Old Rugbeians]] [[Category:People associated with Bletchley Park]] [[Category:Road accident deaths in England]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]] [[de:Donald Michie]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10971</id> <title>Donna Auguste</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=October 2009}} '''Donna Auguste''' (born 1958) is an [[African-American]] [[Businessman|businesswoman]], [[entrepreneur]], and [[philanthropist]].
