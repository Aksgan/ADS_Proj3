may take many forms. Publishing may be the act of pushing content out to others, or simply granting digital access rights to certain content to a particular person or group of persons. Later that content may be superseded by another form of content and thus retired or removed from use. Content management is an inherently collaborative process. It often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities: * Creator - responsible for creating and editing content. * Editor - responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization. * Publisher - responsible for releasing the content for use. * Administrator - responsible for managing access permissions to folders and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles. Admins may also assist and support users in various ways. * Consumer, viewer or guest- the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared. A critical aspect of content management is the ability to manage versions of content as it evolves (''see also'' [[version control]]). Authors and editors often need to restore older versions of edited products due to a process failure or an undesirable series of edits. Another equally important aspect of content management involves the creation, maintenance, and application of review standards. Each member of the content creation and review process has a unique role and set of responsibilities in the development and/or publication of the content. Each review team member requires clear and concise review standards which must be maintained on an ongoing basis to ensure the long-term consistency and health of the knowledge base. A [[content management system]] is a set of automated processes that may support the following features: * Import and creation of documents and multimedia material. * Identification of all key users and their roles. * The ability to assign roles and responsibilities to different instances of content categories or types. * Definition of workflow tasks often coupled with messaging so that content managers are alerted to changes in content. * The ability to track and manage multiple versions of a single instance of content. * The ability to publish the content to a repository to support access to the content. Increasingly, the repository is an inherent part of the system, and incorporates [[enterprise search]] and retrieval. Content management systems take the following forms: *a [[web content management system]] is [[computer software|software]] for [[web site]] management - which is often what is implicitly meant by this term *the work of a [[newspaper]] editorial staff organization *a [[workflow]] for [[essay|article]] publication *a [[document management system]] *a [[Single source publishing|single source]] content management system - where content is stored in chunks within a relational database ''' ==Implementations== Content management implementations must be able to manage content distributions and digital rights in content life cycle. Content management systems are usually involved with [[Digital Rights Management]] in order to control user access and digital rights. In this step the read only structures of [[Digital Rights Management]] Systems force some limitations on Content Management implementations as they do not allow the protected contents to be changed in their life cycle. Creation of new contents using the managed(protected) ones is also another issue which will get the protected contents out of management controlling systems. There are a few Content Management implementations covering all these issues. ==See also== * [[List of content management systems]] * [[Enterprise content management]] * [[Enterprise information management]] * [[Content management system]] * [[Information architecture]] * [[Website architecture]] * [[Web content lifecycle]] * [[Website governance]] * [[Web design]] * [[Digital asset management]] * [[Content engineering]] * [[Content delivery]] * [[Content Management Interoperability Services]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Data management]] [[de:Content-Management]] [[fr:Système de gestion de contenu]] [[ko:콘텐츠 관리]] [[it:Content management]] [[he:ניהול תוכן]] [[nl:Contentmanagement]] [[no:Innholdsforvaltning]] [[ro:Content management]] [[fi:Sisällönhallinta]] [[tr:İçerik yönetimi]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7956</id> <title>Context MBA</title> <text>'''Context MBA''' was the first [[integrated software]] application for personal computers, providing five functions in one program: [[spreadsheet]], [[database]], [[chart]]ing, [[word processing]], and [[communication software]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?page_id=8250 |title = Whatever Happened to Context MBA? |accessdate = 2007-12-24 |authorlink = John C Dvorak |publisher = Dvorak Uncensored }}</ref> It was first released in 1981 by Context Management Systems for the [[Apple III]] computer,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.aresluna.org/attached/computerhistory/articles/spreadsheets/tenyearsofrowsandcolumns |title = Ten Years of Rows and Columns |accessdate = 2007-12-24 |author = Tracy Robnett Licklider |date = 1989 |work = [[Byte Magazine]] }}</ref> but was later ported to the [[IBM PC]] platform as well. Since the program was written in [[UCSD Pascal]], it was easy to port to different platforms, but did so at the expense of performance, which was critical at the time of its release, given the limited amount of memory, processing power, and disk I/O available on a desktop computer. It was soon overtaken by [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a more limited integrated software package, but one written in [[assembly language]], yielding much better performance. == References == {{Reflist}} {{business-software-stub}} [[Category:DOS software]] [[Category:Spreadsheet software]] [[Category:History of software]] [[ms:Context MBA]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7976</id> <title>Continued fraction factorization</title> <text>In [[number theory]], the '''continued fraction factorization method''' ('''CFRAC''') is an [[integer factorization]] [[algorithm]].
