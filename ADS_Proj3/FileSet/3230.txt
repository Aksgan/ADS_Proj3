All NTFS versions used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows are supported. No defragmentation is required prior to resizing since version 1.11.2. ntfsresize is included in the [[ntfsprogs]] package, developed by the [[Linux-NTFS]] project. For those that don't have a [[Unix]] system installed, it is still possible to run ntfsresize by using one of the many Linux [[Live CD]]s. == ntfsresize features== * Full compatibility with all known NTFS versions from Windows NT 3.1 to Windows Vista * Checks internal structures for errors * Will work in various difficult situations: ** No [[defragmentation]] needed prior to use ** Supports both shrinking and expanding NTFS ** Supports resizing volumes with known [[bad sector]]s in them * Will refuse to run under certain conditions: ** When the volume is flagged dirty, that is marked for Windows to run [[CHKDSK]] at boot. The --force switch will over-ride this ** When Windows is hibernated on the partition == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://man.linux-ntfs.org/ntfsresize.8.html?id=1 ntfsresize man] *[http://www.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=ntfsresize ntfsresize homepage] *[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13956&package_id=14232 Download page at sourceforge] [[Category:Free storage software]] [[Category:Unix]] [[vi:ntfsresize]] {{storage-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>26749</id> <title>Ntop</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=February 2010}} {{Infobox software | name = Ntop | developer = [[Luca Deri]] | programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]] | platform = [[Cross-platform]],including [[Unix]], [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] | language = English | genre = Network analyzer | license = [[GPLv3]] | website = http://www.ntop.org }} {{Lowercase|ntop}} '''ntop''' is a network probe that shows network usage in a way similar to what [[Top (Unix)|top]] does for processes. In interactive mode, it displays the [[Computer networking|network]] status on the user's terminal. In Web mode, it acts as a [[web server]], creating a [[HTML]] dump of the network status. It sports a [[NetFlow]]/[[sFlow]] emitter/collector, a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]-based client interface for creating ntop-centric monitoring applications, and [[RRDtool|RRD]] for persistently storing traffic statistics.<ref>[http://www.ntop.org/overview.html Ntop Feature Overview]</ref> ntop is available for both [[Unix]] and Win32-based platforms. It has been developed by [[Luca Deri]], an [[Italy|Italian]] research scientist and network manager at [[University of Pisa]]. Common usage on a [[Linux]] system is to start the ntop daemon (/etc/init.d/ntopd start), then one can use the web interface to ntop via visiting http://127.0.0.1:3000 provided the loopback device has been started (/etc/init.d/net.lo start) and the listening port for ntop is 3000 (look out for the -w option in ps aux | grep ntop). ==External links== * [http://www.ntop.org/ ntop homepage] * [http://wiki.ntop.org/ ntop wiki] * [http://www.ntop.org/blog ntop blog] * [http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-install-ntop-on-rhel-centos-fedora-linux/ Tutorial: Install ntop under Linux] * [http://www.gingercatsoftware.com/blog_detail.php?uniqid=90/ Tutorial: Install ntop on Mac os X Snow Leopard ] * [http://www.evolutionaryit.com/articles/Nbox_Building_Embedded_Ntop.pdf Tutorial: nBox - Envision your network with nBox (PDF)] * [http://www.howtoforge.com/network_monitoring_with_nbox Monitoring your network with Ntop] ==References== <references/> [[Category:Network analyzers]] [[Category:Unix network-related software]] [[Category:Linux security software]]
