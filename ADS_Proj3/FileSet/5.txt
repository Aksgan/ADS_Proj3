It ran on [[PC compatible]] computer systems based on the [[Intel 80386]] [[microprocessor]]. 386BSD innovations include [[role-based security]], [[ring buffer]]s, self-ordered configuration and [[Loadable kernel module|modular kernel]] design. == History == 386BSD was written mainly by Berkeley alumni [[Lynne Jolitz]] and [[William Jolitz]]. William Jolitz had considerable experience with prior BSD releases while at the University of California at Berkeley (2.8 and 2.9BSD) and both contributed code to Berkeley developed at [[Symmetric Computer Systems]] during the 1980s. Work on porting 4.3BSD-Reno and later 4.3BSD Net/2 to the Intel 80386 was done for the University of California by William Jolitz at Berkeley. 4.3BSD Net/2 was an incomplete non-operational release, with portions withheld by the University of California as ''encumbered'' (i.e. subject to an [[AT&T UNIX]] [[source code]] license). The 386BSD releases made to the public beginning in 1992 were based on portions of the 4.3BSD Net/2 release coupled with additional code (see ''Missing Pieces I and II'', [[Dr. Dobb's Journal]], May–June 1992) written by William and Lynne Jolitz to make a complete operational release. The port began in 1989 and the first, incomplete traces of the port can be found in 4.3BSD Net/2 of 1991. It was first released in March 1992 (version 0.0) and in a much more usable version on July 14, 1992 (version 0.1). The porting process with code was extensively documented in an 18-part series written by Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz in [[Dr. Dobbs Journal]] beginning in January 1991. ===FreeBSD and NetBSD=== After the release of 386BSD 0.1, a group of users began collecting bug fixes and enhancements, releasing them as an unofficial ''[[patch (computing)|patchkit]]''. Due to differences of opinion between the Jolitzes and the patchkit maintainers over the future direction and release schedule of 386BSD, the maintainers of the patchkit founded the [[FreeBSD]] project in 1993 to continue their work<ref>[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/history.html About the FreeBSD Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Around the same time, the [[NetBSD]] project was founded by a different group of 386BSD users, with the aim of unifying 386BSD with other strands of BSD development into one multi-platform system. Both projects continue to this day. ===Lawsuit=== Due to a lawsuit ([[Unix System Laboratories|USL]] v. Regents of the University of California), some potentially so-called ''encumbered'' source was agreed to have been distributed within the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] from the University of California, and a subsequent release (1993, 4.4BSD-Lite) was made by the University to correct this issue. However, 386BSD, Dr. Dobbs Journal, and William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California, and continued to publish and work on the 386BSD code base before, during, and after these lawsuits without limitation. There has never been any legal filings or claims from the University, USL, or other responsible parties with respect to 386BSD. Finally, no code developed for 386BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits. ==Release 1.0== In late 1994, a finished version 386BSD Release 1.0 was distributed by Dr. Dobb's Journal on CDROM only due to the immense size (600 [[megabyte|MB]]) of the release (the ''"386BSD Reference CD-ROM"'') and was a best-selling CDROM for three years (1994–1997). 386BSD Release 1.0 contained a completely new kernel design and implementation, and began the process to incorporate recommendations made by earlier Berkeley designers that had never been attempted in BSD. ==Relationship with BSD/386== 386BSD is often confused
