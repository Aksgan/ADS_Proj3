Specifically, the Business Motivation Model does all of the following: * identifies factors that motivate the establishing of business plans; * identifies and defines the elements of business plans; and * indicates how all these factors and elements inter-relate. Among these elements are those that provide governance for and guidance to the business — Business Policies and Business Rules. The specification of the Business Motivation Model is maintained by [[Object Management Group]] and is available at http://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/ Other related frameworks are [[POLDAT]] and the[[Zachman Framework]]. == See also == * [[i*]] * [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] * [[Motivation]] == External references == {{commonscat|Business Motivation Model}} * [http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/bmm.shtml The Business Motivation Model] Business Governance in a Volatile World, Release 1.3, Business Rules Group (2007) * [http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2008_11/column6/index.html From the Business Motivation Model to Service Oriented Architecture], by Birol Berkem, ''Journal Of Object Technology'' vol.7, no.8– (2008) {{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}} [[Category:Business process]] [[Category:Enterprise modelling]] {{Business-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>4773</id> <title>Business Object Notation</title> <text>In [[software engineering]], '''Business Object Notation''' ('''BON''') is a method and graphical notation for high-level [[object-oriented analysis]] and [[object-oriented design|design]].
