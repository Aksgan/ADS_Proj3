Shepherd (Winter, 1994) How Are the Mighty Fallen: Rejected Classic Articles by Leading Economists, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 8, No. 1 , pp. 165-179 {{jstor|2138157}}</ref> Akerlof eventually received a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize]] for the broad applications of the theory in this paper. ==New vehicles== New vehicles may contain hidden mechanical flaws or defects in workmanship, caused by design flaws or by an error during the automotive factory build process. These errors can range from parts being installed incorrectly to a tool that was used to build the car not being removed or a batch of materials with structural or chemical flaws. Consumer protection legislation typically labels vehicles as "lemons" if the same problem recurs despite multiple repair attempts (such as three times in a row over a short period, where previous attempts have not fixed the problem) or where defects have caused a new vehicle to be out of service for a prolonged period (typically thirty days or longer) for repairs. The primary objective of these [[lemon law]]s is to force manufacturers to [[buy back]] defective vehicles or exchange them. Depending on the jurisdiction, a process similar to [[vehicle title branding]] may also be used to warn subsequent purchasers of the history of a problem vehicle. This portion of a vehicle's history is, however, often not retained with the vehicle title when exporting vehicles to another jurisdiction. ==Used vehicles== While [[used car]]s may be plagued with the same problems that beset new vehicles, used vehicles may also have been abused, improperly maintained or poorly repaired, been unprofessionally rebuilt after a collision or tampered with in some manner to conceal high mileage, mechanical defects, corrosion or other damage. One form of lemon is called a '''cut and shut''' or '''clipping''', a form of body collision "repair" based on buying a wrecked car and sawing off the wrecked section to replace it with a matching section from another (similar) car. If improperly repaired these vehicles may be inherently dangerous; at high speeds, or in an accident, the car may come apart due to the weaknesses of the [[welding|welds]] or pins connecting the two segments of the vehicle or mismatches of segments. <ref name="Autotrader UK">{{cite web |url=http://www.autotrader.co.uk/advice/2010/07/safety-and-security/illegal-cars|title=Illegal cars|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref> <ref name="Autoweb.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweb.co.uk/article/574|title=CUT AND SHUT ACCIDENT HORRORS - BAN THE ‘FRANKENSTEIN’ CARS|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ''cut and shut'' cars are treated like any car that has had major repair work resulting in what is essentially a new car. They must first be inspected for road-worthiness, be assigned a new [[Vehicle registration plate|registration number]] and pass the standard [[MOT test]]. If this is successful they will be given a "Q" registration, meaning they are a kit, or composite car and not an original unit from the manufacturer. <ref name="DVLA-INF26">{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/forms/%7E/media/pdf/leaflets/inf26.ashx|title=Guidelines on how you can register kit cars and rebuilt or radically altered vehicles|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref> In the USA the sale of ''cut and shut'' vehicles is illegal in some states. Cars created using two or more large sections of previous ones are sometimes called "zipper cars". Improperly repaired collision-damage vehicles also carry the risk of [[unibody]] problems. Unlike heavy [[truck]]s and [[lorry|lorries]], most passenger cars manufactured since 1987 employ unibody construction instead of a separate body and frame.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} This saves weight, but the unibody is prone to bend (it is designed to do so in an impact, to absorb part of the energy of the shock) or suffer damage in severe collisions, causing the vehicle not to handle correctly or causing other mechanical parts to wear prematurely if the damaged unibody vehicle is driven after an accident. Today, there are [[Used car|vehicle history services]] that can help a prospective used car buyer by providing a "history report" based on the vehicle's serial number ([[vehicle identification number|VIN]]). These reports will indicate items of public record, such as [[vehicle title branding]], [[lemon law]] buybacks and recalls. They may indicate minor/moderate collision damage or improper vehicle maintenance. An attempt to identify vehicles which have been previously owned by hire car rental agencies, police and emergency services or taxi fleets is also made. However, consumers should research vehicles carefully, as these reporting services only report the information to which they have access. Manufacturers have been known to "hide" lemon law buybacks from these reporting services through such unscrupulous methods as holding the buyback vehicle in a dealer's inventory for a short period of time, then funneling it through routine inventory (so-called "dealer only") auctions where the buyback vehicle re-enters the used market as a seemingly legitimate vehicle. While history reports can provide useful information and highlight trouble areas, consumers are still advised to have a trusted, independent mechanic perform a pre-buy inspection on any used vehicle of which they do not personally know the history. ==See also== * [[Lemon socialism]] * [[Totaled]] * [[Used car]] * [[Vehicle title branding]] * For Canada - [[Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Car classifications]] [[Category:Quality]] [[Category:Slang]] [[de:Montagsstück]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21473</id> <title>Lenstra elliptic curve factorization</title> <text>The '''Lenstra elliptic curve factorization''' or the '''elliptic curve factorization method''' ('''ECM''') is a fast, sub-[[exponential running time]] algorithm for [[integer factorization]] which employs [[elliptic curve]]s. For [[general purpose computer|general purpose]] factoring, ECM is the third-fastest known factoring method. The second fastest is the [[quadratic sieve|multiple polynomial quadratic sieve]] and the fastest is the [[general number field sieve]]. It is named after [[Hendrik Lenstra]]. Practically speaking, ECM is considered a special purpose factoring algorithm as it is most suitable for finding small factors. {{As of|2006|alt=Currently}}, it is still the best algorithm for [[divisor]]s not greatly exceeding 20 to 25 [[decimal|digits]] (64 to 83 [[binary digit|bit]]s or so), as its running time is dominated by the size of the smallest factor ''p'' rather than by the size of the number ''n'' to be factored. Frequently, ECM is used to remove small factors from a very large integer with many factors;
