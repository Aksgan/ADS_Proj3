agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process." <ref name="Annapolis Group"/> This database will be web based and developed in conjunction with higher education organizations including the [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]] and the [[Council of Independent Colleges]]. On 22 June 2007, ''U.S. News and World Report'' editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, "in terms of the peer [[Educational assessment|assessment]] survey, we at ''U.S. News'' firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the "[[intangibles]]" of a college that we can't measure through [[Statistics|statistical data]]. Plus, the [[reputation]] of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature [[Subjectivity|subjective]], but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between [[Private university|private]] and [[Public university|public colleges]]." <ref name="Morse">{{cite web | first =Robert| last = Morse| title =About the Annapolis Group's Statement| publisher = [[U.S. News and World Report]] | date = 22 June 2007 | url= http://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more}}</ref> In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, "It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] ''U.S. News'' has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. ''U.S. News'' first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of ''U.S. News''." <ref name="Morse"/> ==References and further reading== <div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count: 2"> *[[Annapolis Group]].
