He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a diploma on 5 May 1908, after developing an interest in aeronautics.<ref>Monk, p. 27.</ref> He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to do his doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near Glossop, and living nearby at the Grouse Inn, a pub on Chunal Road, Derbyshire, where he was one of only two guests, along with a Mr. Rimmer. He told Hermine he loved the isolation of the Grouse Inn, but was less enamored of the toilet facilities.<ref name=Grouse>Monk, p. 29. *Also see [http://www.grouse-inn-glossop.co.uk/history.html "The Grouse Inn"], grouse-inn-glossop.co.uk, accessed 12 September 2010.</ref> He also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911 and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.<ref name=Monk30>Monk, pp. 30–35.</ref> [[File:The Grouse Inn near Glossop.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Witttgenstein stayed at the Grouse Inn in 1908 while engaged in research near [[Glossop]].<ref name=Grouse/>]] It was around this time that he became interested in the [[foundations of mathematics]], particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903), and [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'', vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).<ref>Beaney, Michael (ed.). ''The Frege Reader''. Blackwell, 1997, pp. 194-223, 258&ndash;289.</ref> Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study philosophy, describing himself as in a "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation."<ref name=Monk30/> In the summer of 1911 he decided to visit Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing; the work did not survive, perhaps because, as he said, Frege wiped the floor with him.<ref name=Monk36>Monk, p. 36ff.</ref> He wrote: "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again,' so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics."<ref>Kanterian, Edward. ''Ludwig Wittgenstein''. Reaktion Books, 2007, p. 36.</ref> ===Arrival at Cambridge=== Wittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].<ref name=ConnorRobertson>O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wittgenstein.html "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein"], St Andrews University, accessed 2 September 2010.</ref> Russell was having tea with C.K. Ogden, when, according to Russell, "... an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics & has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me."<ref name=Monk36/> He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [[C.D. Broad]], [[Eric Harold Neville|E.H. Neville]], and H.T.J. Norton, so he was quite pleased at first when Wittgenstein turned up, though less so as the weeks wore on.<ref name=Monk36/> Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in Hall. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]]: "My German friend threatens to be an infliction."<ref name=McGuinness88>McGuinness, Brian.

He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced."<ref name=McGuinness88/> Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival he told Morrell: "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for."<ref name=Monk41>Monk, p. 41.</ref> The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized his own work: "His criticism, 'tho I don't think he realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy."<ref>Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography''.
