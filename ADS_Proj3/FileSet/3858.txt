to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16-hours-a-day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]—''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musicquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''—distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, Images, in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990 for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests. From 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] [[Dance music|dance]] singles—"Electric World", "One Kiss", "No Expectations", "Say Baby I Love You", "Don't Tell Me", "Wildest Dreams", "Life is The Rhythm", "Pleasure Garden" and "Acid Heat"—that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, "The Music Now" and "Idex Music Jam." In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced "Crystallization" in 1986. ====1991–2000 (return to jazz guitarist)==== Kawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and [[record producer]]. Ryo's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album "[[Here, There and Everywhere]]" (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] singer and [[guitarist]] [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo's has continued to release a steady string of albums—the acoustic "My Reverie" (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented "Love Within The Universe" (which received considerable airplay across the country), "Remixes Remixes Vol. 1" (also featuring Benson), "Sweet Life" and CD releases of "Mirror of my Mind" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam). His another recent release "Cosmic Rhythm" in 1999 features British singer lyrisist [[Clare Foster]] along with Ryo's current rhythm section [[Victor Jones]] on Drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on Bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on Piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on Flugel Horn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Ryo Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ryo himself. During 1995–1999, three noteworthy [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] Super Stars [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]] and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]] have recorded Ryo's original composition "[[Bamboo Child]]" on their latest albums more than twenty years later from its original recording, proving that even Ryo's old recording would perfectly match with current Hip-Hop beats and moods. ===New developments in Estonia and beyond (2000 – present)=== Ryo has released live studio trio album "Reval" in 2001, recorded in [[Tallinn]] [[Estonia]] with Estonia's leading musicians Toivo Unt on Bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on Drums and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]]. His other projects include being a [[composer]], [[music director]] as well as [[guitarist]] for the jazz ballet "Still Point" for [[Estonia]]n National [[Opera House]] during 2000 -2002.

From year 2000, Kawasaki has further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]] as well as [[:ru:Саранск|Саранск]] ([[Saransk]]) Jazz Ark Festival, Saransk is a Capital of [[Mordovia]] [[Republic]] located 630 km east from Moscow.
