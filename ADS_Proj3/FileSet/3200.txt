subset of these axioms is satisfied by a model which is the standard model of arithmetic plus the constant ''x'' interpreted as some number larger than any numeral mentioned in the finite subset of P*. Thus by the compactness theorem there is a model satisfying all the axioms P*. Since any model of P* is a model of P (since a model of a set of axioms is obviously also a model of any subset of that set of axioms), we have that our extended model is also a model of the Peano axioms. The element of this model corresponding to ''x'' cannot be a standard number, because as indicated it is larger than any standard number. Using more complex methods, it is possible to build nonstandard models that possess more complicated properties. For example, there are models of Peano arithmetic in which [[Goodstein's theorem]] fails. It can be proved in ZFC that Goodstein's theorem holds in the standard model, so a model where Goodstein's theorem fails must be nonstandard. === From the incompleteness theorems === [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] also imply the existence of non-standard models of arithmetic. The incompleteness theorems show that a particular sentence ''G'', the Gödel sentence of Peano arithmetic, is not provable nor disprovable in Peano arithmetic. By the [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness theorem]], this means that ''G'' is false in some model of Peano arithmetic. However, ''G'' is true in the standard model of arithmetic, and therefore any model in which ''G'' is false must be a nonstandard model. The Gödel sentence for Peano arithmetic says, in essence, "There is no coded proof of 0=1 from the axioms of Peano arithmetic". In a model where the Gödel sentence is false, there ''is'' such a coded proof (although the code is a nonstandard number). Because Peano arithmetic proves there is a coded proof of <math>0 \not = 1</math>, and because Peano arithmetic is able to formalize the [[Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions|usual properties of the provability predicate]], a nonstandard model in which the Gödel sentence fails will have a coded proof of every sentence in the language of arithmetic. This does not, however, mean that Peano arithmetic is inconsistent; it only shows that formalized provability within a model of PA may differ from actual provability. === From an ultraproduct === Another method for constructing a non-standard model of arithmetic is via an [[ultraproduct]]. A typical construction uses the set of all sequences of natural numbers, <math>\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}</math>. Identify two sequences if they agree for a set of indices which is a member of a fixed non-principal [[ultrafilter]]. The resulting ring is a non-standard model of arithmetic. It can be identified with the [[hypernatural]] numbers. == Structure of countable non-standard models == Any [[countable]] nonstandard model of arithmetic has [[order type]] ω + (ω* + ω) · η, where ω is the order type of the standard natural numbers, ω* is the dual order (an infinite decreasing sequence) and η is the order type of the rational numbers. In other words, a countable nonstandard model begins with an infinite increasing sequence (the standard elements of the model). This is followed by a collection of "blocks," each of order type ω* + ω, the order type of the integers. These blocks are in turn densely ordered with the order type of the rationals. Although the order type of the countable nonstandard models is known, the arithmetical operations are much more complicated. [[Tennenbaum's theorem]] shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic in which either the addition or multiplication operation is [[recursion theory|computable]]. This result, first obtained by Stanley Tennenbaum in 1959, places a severe limitation on the ability to concretely describe the arithmetical operations of a countable nonstandard model. ==References== * Boolos, G., and Jeffrey, R. 1974.

This is in contrast to the most common forms of random access memory today, [[dynamic random access memory]] (DRAM) and [[static random access memory]] (SRAM), which both require continual power in order to maintain their data. NVRAM is a subgroup of the more general class of non-volatile memory types, the difference being that NVRAM devices offer [[random access]], unlike [[hard disk]]s. The best-known form of NVRAM memory today is [[flash memory]]. Some drawbacks to flash memory include the requirement to write it in larger blocks than many computers can automically address, and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles (most consumer flash products at the time of writing can only withstand around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate). Another drawback is the performance limitations preventing flash from matching the response times and, in some cases, the random addressability offered by traditional forms of RAM. Several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles, and some even claim to be a truly [[Universal_Memory|universal memory]], offering the performance of the best SRAM devices with the non-volatility of flash. To date these alternatives have not yet become mainstream. ==Early NVRAMs== Early computers used a variety of memory systems, some of which happened to be non-volatile, although not typically by design but simply as a side effect of their construction. The most common form of memory through the 1960s was [[magnetic core memory]], which stored data in the polarity of small magnets. Since the magnets held their state even with the power removed, core memory was also non-volatile. Rapid advances in [[semiconductor fabrication]] in the 1970s led to a new generation of [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] memories that core simply could not compete with. Relentless market
