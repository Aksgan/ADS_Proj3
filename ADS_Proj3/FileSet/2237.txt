version 5<ref>[http://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/ana19980302.html Maintaining IPX Compatibility During a Migration to TCP/IP on a NetWare Network]</ref> in late 1998. ==IPX addressing== * Logical networks are assigned a unique 32-bit [[hexadecimal]] address in the range of 0x1 - 0xFFFFFFFE. * Hosts have a 48-bit node address which by default is set to the network interface card's [[MAC address]]. The node address is appended to the network address to create a unique identifier for the host on the network. * Network number 00:00:00:00 means current network * Broadcast address is FF:FF:FF:FF ===Similarities with IP=== The IPX network address is conceptually identical to the network part of the [[IP address]] (the parts with [[netmask]] bits set to 1); the node address then has the same meaning as the bits of IP address with netmask bits set to 0. As the node address is usually identical to the MAC address of the network adapter, the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] is not needed. For [[routing]], the entries in the IPX [[routing table]] are similar to IP routing tables; routing is done by network address, and for each network address a network:node of the next router is specified in a similar fashion an IP address/netmask is specified in IP routing tables. ===IPX over Ethernet=== IPX can be transmitted over Ethernet using one of the following 4 encapsulation types: *[[802.3]] (raw) is used in legacy systems and involves IPX data starting immediately after 802.3 frame header. The packet starts with Destination Ethernet Address (6 bytes), Source Ethernet Address (6 bytes), Frame Length (2 bytes) followed by IPX data. Latter always starts with two 0xFF bytes (Checksum field), and this can be used to differentiate this type of IPX encapsulation from next two types. *[[802.2]] (Novell) comprises 802.3 frame header (destination, source, length) followed by LLC header (3 bytes - 0xE0, 0xE0, 0x03) followed by IPX data. 0xE0 fields of LLC header stand for 'Novell' protocol. *[[802.2]] ([[Subnetwork Access Protocol|SNAP]]) comprises 802.3 frame header, LLC header (3 bytes - 0xAA, 0xAA, 0x03), SNAP header (5 bytes - 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x81, 0x37) and IPX data. 0xAA fields of LLC header stand for 'SNAP' protocol. First three bytes of SNAP header are [[Organizationally Unique Identifier|OUI]] followed by 2 bytes of IPX [[EtherType]]. *[[Ethernet II framing|Ethernet II]] comprises Ethernet II frame header (Destination, Source, [[EtherType]]) followed by IPX data. ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1132 RFC 1132 - A Standard for the Transmission of 802.2 Packets over IPX Networks] [[Category:Netware]] [[Category:Network layer protocols]] [[bs:IPX]] [[cv:IPX]] [[de:Internetwork Packet Exchange]] [[es:Internetwork Packet Exchange]] [[eu:Internetwork Packet Exchange]] [[fr:Internetwork Packet Exchange]] [[ko:IPX]] [[id:IPX]] [[it:Internetwork Packet Exchange]] [[he:IPX]] [[lv:IPX]] [[nl:IPX]] [[no:IPX]] [[pl:IPX]] [[ro:IPX]] [[ru:IPX]] [[sv:IPX]] [[uk:IPX]] [[zh:互联网分组交换协议]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19173</id> <title>Interpolation attack</title> <text>In [[cryptography]], an '''interpolation attack''' is a type of [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic attack]] against [[block cipher]]s. In the attack, an algebraic function is used to represent an [[S-box]]. This may be a simple [[quadratic function|quadratic]], or a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]] over a [[Galois field]]. Its coefficients can be determined by standard [[Lagrange interpolation]] techniques, using [[known-plaintext attack|known plaintexts]] as data points. Alternatively, [[chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintexts]] can be used to simplify the equations and optimize the attack. [[Thomas Jakobsen]] introduced a [[randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] version of the interpolation attack using [[Madhu Sudan]]'s algorithm for improved decoding of [[Reed-Solomon code]]s. This attack can work even when an algebraic relationship between plaintexts and ciphertexts holds for only a fraction of values. == References == * {{cite conference | author = [[Thomas Jakobsen]], [[Lars Knudsen]] | title = The Interpolation Attack on Block Ciphers | conference = 4th International Workshop on [[Fast Software Encryption]] (FSE '97), LNCS 1267 | pages = pp.28&ndash;40 | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | month = January | year = 1997 | location = [[Haifa]] | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/jakobsen97interpolation.html | format = [[PDF]]/[[PostScript]] | accessdate = 2007-07-03}} * {{cite conference | author = Thomas Jakobsen | title = Cryptanalysis of Block Ciphers with Probabilistic Non-linear Relations of Low Degree | conference = Advances in Cryptology &mdash; [[CRYPTO]] '98 | pages = pp.212&ndash;222 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | date = August 25, 1998 | location = [[Santa Barbara, California]] | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/jakobsen98cryptanalysis.html | format = PDF/PostScript | accessdate = 2007-07-06 }} ([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-502705185794473481&hl=en Video of presentation] at [[Google Video]]&mdash;uses [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]) * {{cite conference | author = Shiho Moriai, Takeshi Shimoyama, Toshinobu Kaneko | title = Interpolation Attacks of the Block Cipher: SNAKE | conference = FSE '99 | pages = pp.275&ndash;289 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | month = March | year = 1999 | location = [[Rome]] | url = http://www.mathmagic.cn/Crypt1998-2003/bibs/1636/16360275.htm | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }} * {{cite conference | author = Amr M.

Many [[formal languages]] used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical computer science]] are defined in solely [[syntax|syntactic]] terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[formal semantics]]. The most commonly studied formal logics are [[propositional logic]], [[predicate logic]] and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that provides the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]]
