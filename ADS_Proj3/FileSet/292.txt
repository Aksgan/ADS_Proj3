multiple host bus adapters with hardware encryption units used for better performance requirements. In contrast, this type of encryption can be implemented with only 1 host bus adapter connected to a network of multiple hard drives and would still function. Performance will definitely be reduced since there will only be one encryption unit processing data. Key management will be done much like the internal array controller encryption mentioned before with the Key Management Client implemented as a service within the Host Computer. <br style="clear:both;"/> == External links == *[http://www.pmc-sierra.com/products/details/pm8031/ PM8031 Encryption Enabled IC] *[http://www.pmc-sierra.com/products/details/pm8032/ PM8032 Encryption Enabled IC] {{DEFAULTSORT:Array Controller Based Encryption}} [[Category:Cryptography]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2425</id> <title>Ars Technica</title> <text>{{good article}} {{Infobox Website | name = Ars Technica | logo = [[File:Ars Technica logo.png|64px]] | screenshot = [[File:Ars Technica-front page.jpg|200px]]<!-- please don't update this image unless the layout is significantly changed--> | url = http://arstechnica.com/ | alexa = 1,931 <ref name="alexa"/> | commercial = Yes | type = Technology news and information | registration = Optional | owner = [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Digital]] | author = Ken Fisher<br/>Jon Stokes | launch date = December 30, 1998 | current status = Online }} '''Ars Technica''' ({{pronEng|ˌɑrz ˈtɛknɨkə}}), [[Latin]] for "Art of Technology"<ref name=latin/>, is a technology news and information website created by Ken Fisher and Jon Stokes in 1998. It publishes news, reviews and guides on issues such as computer hardware and software, science, technology policy, and video games. Ars Technica is known for its features; long articles that go into specific detail on their subjects. Many of the site's writers are postgraduates, and some work for research institutions. Articles on the website are often written in an opinionated tone, as opposed to a journal. Ars Technica was privately owned until May 2008 when it was sold to Condé Nast Digital—the online division of [[Condé Nast Publications]]. Condé Nast purchased the site along with two others for $25 million, and added it to their Wired Digital group that also includes [[Wired News]] and [[Reddit]]. The website's staff relocated to Chicago, Illinois, and also have offices in San Francisco, California. The cost of operating Ars Technica has always been funded primarily by online advertising. The website generated controversy in 2009 when it experimentally blocked users who use advertisement blocking software from viewing the site. Ars Technica has also offered a paid subscription service since 2001. == History == Ken Fisher and Jon Stokes created the Ars Technica [[website]] and [[limited liability company]] in 1998.<ref name=llc/> Its purpose was to publish computer [[hardware]] and [[Computer software| software]]-related news articles and guides;<ref name=wsj_video/> in their words, "the best multi-OS, PC hardware, and tech coverage possible while [..] having fun, being productive, and being as informative and as accurate as possible."<ref name=orig_mission_statement/> "Ars technica" is a [[Latin]] [[attributive construction]] that translates to "art of technology".<ref name=wsj_video/> The website published news, reviews, guides, and other content of interest to computer enthusiasts. Writers for Ars Technica were geographically distributed in the United States at the time; Fisher lived in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], Stokes in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and the other writers in their respective cities.<ref name=llc/><ref name=orig_staff/> On May 19, 2008, Ars Technica was sold to Condé Nast Digital—the online division of [[Condé Nast Publications]].<ref group=note>Condé Nast Digital was named CondéNet at the time.[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=99121]</ref> The sale was part of a combination purchase by Condé Nast Digital of three unaffiliated websites costing $25 million total: Ars Technica, [[Webmonkey]], and [[HotWired|Hot Wired]]. Ars Technica was added to the company's Wired Digital group that includes [[Wired News]] and [[Reddit]]. In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fisher said other companies offered to buy Ars Technica, and that the site's writers agreed to a deal with Condé Nast because they felt it offered them the best chance to turn their "hobby" into a business.<ref name=nytimes_buyout/> Fisher, Stokes, and the eight other writers at the time were employed by Condé Nast, with Fisher as [[editor in chief]],<ref name=arrington/><ref name=boomtown/> and they began relocating to Chicago.<ref name=ars-v5/> [[Layoff]]s at Condé Nast in November 2008 affected websites owned by the company "across the board", including Ars Technica.<ref name=layoffs/> == Content == The content of articles published by Ars Technica has generally remained the same since its creation in 1998. Articles include commentary and opinion by the writers, and are usually accompanied by pictures for illustration, or for [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] purposes. They are now categorized by four types: News, Guides, Reviews, and Features. News articles relay current events. Guides instruct readers on how to do things; for example, the Ars Technica System Guide that advises readers on which computer parts to buy when building a computer. Reviews give opinionated assessment of hardware and software products. Features are longer informative articles. The website's readers can post their comments and start discussions at the bottom of each article. Ars Technica also hosts OpenForum, a free [[internet forum]] for the discussion of a variety of topics. Originally, most news articles published by the website were relayed from other technology-related websites. Ars Technica provided short commentary on the news, generally a few paragraphs, and a link to the original source. After being purchased by Conde Nast, Ars Technica began publishing more original news; investigating topics and interviewing sources themselves. A significant portion of the news articles published there now are original. Ars Technica was criticized in 2006 for quoting a [[blog|blogger]] in a news article without giving attribution for the quote; after the blogger raised the issue, the article's writer apologized and retroactively added attribution.<ref name=boomtown/> Relayed news is still published on the website, ranging from one- or two-sentences to a few paragraphs. Ars Technica's Features are long articles that go into specific detail on their subject.<ref name=atlantic/><ref name=guardian_long_os_revs/> For example, the site published a guide on CPU architecture in 1998 named "Understanding CPU caching and performance".<ref name=old_cpu_guide/> An article in 2009 discussed in detail the [[Scientific theory|theory]], [[physics]], [[mathematical proof]]s, and applications of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=qubits/> The website's 18,000-word review of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPad]] described everything from the product's packaging,
