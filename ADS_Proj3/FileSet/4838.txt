Tuesday of each month, [[Patch Tuesday]], but can be provided whenever a new update is urgently required to prevent a newly discovered or prevalent [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] targeting Windows users. Windows Update can be configured to install critical updates automatically so long as the computer is connected to the Internet, without the user needing to install them manually, or even be aware that an update is required . [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows Server 2008]], and [[Windows 7]] provide a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] to configure update settings and check for updates. The Windows Update Control Panel is also the means to download [[Windows Ultimate Extras]], optional software for Windows Vista Ultimate Edition. For previous versions of Microsoft Windows, updates can be downloaded from the Windows Update website, using [[Internet Explorer]]. ==History== [[File:Windows Update v3.png|left|thumb|Windows Update version 3 in [[Windows 98]]]] ===Windows Update web site=== Windows Update was introduced as an Internet [[web site]] with the launch of [[Windows 95]]. A link to Windows Update on the Start Menu gave access to additional downloads for the operating system. At the time of Windows 98's release Windows Update offered additional desktop themes, games, device driver updates, and optional components such as [[NetMeeting]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/win98/TWB19980625S0017 |title=Taking Windows 98 For A Test-Drive |last=Gartner |first=John |date=August 24, 1995 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |publisher=TechWeb }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT 4]] were retroactively given the ability to access the Windows Update website, and download updates designed for those operating systems, starting with the release of versions of Internet Explorer 4 for those operating systems. The initial focus of Windows Update was on free add-ons and new technologies for Windows; security fixes for [[Outlook Express]], Internet Explorer and other applications appeared later, as did access to beta versions of upcoming Microsoft software, most notably [[Internet Explorer 5]]. Fixes to Windows 98 to resolve the [[Year 2000 problem]] were distributed using Windows Update in December 1998. Microsoft attributed the sales success of Windows 98 in part to Windows Update.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/feb99/holislpr.mspx |title=Strong Holiday Sales Make Windows 98 Best-Selling Software of 1998 |date=February 9, 1999 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=PressPass |publisher=[[Microsoft]] }}</ref> Windows Update requires [[Internet Explorer]] or a third-party web browser that uses Microsoft's [[Trident (layout engine)|MSHTML]] [[layout engine]], as it must support the use of an [[ActiveX control]] to house the software that is executed on the user's computer. While details have changed from version to version, it has always scanned the computer to find what operating system components and software are installed, and compared the versions of those components with the latest available versions. The ActiveX component then interfaces with [[Windows Installer]] to install or update those components, and to report the success or failure of those installations back to Microsoft's servers. The first version of the Windows Update web site (usually referred to as "v3") did not require any personally-identifiable information to be sent to Microsoft. In order for the v3 ActiveX control to determine what updates were needed, the entire list of available software on Windows Update was downloaded to the user's computer when they visited the Windows Update web site. As the number of updates offered by Windows Update grew, this resulted in performance concerns. Arie Slob, writing for the Windows-help.net newsletter in March 2003, noted that the size of the update list had exceeded 400[[Kilobyte|KB]], which caused delays of more than a minute for [[dial-up]] users.<ref name="arieslob">{{cite web |url=http://www.windowsnewsletter.com/html-archive/2003/22mar2003.html |title=Windows Update is Spying on You! |last=Slob |first=Arie |date=March 22, 2003 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |publisher=windows-help.net }}</ref> Windows Update v4, released in conjunction with Windows XP in 2001, changed this by having the ActiveX control submit a list of the hardware components to Microsoft's servers, which then returns a list of only those device drivers available for that machine. It also narrowed down the list of available updates for the operating system and related components by sending details of what operating system version, service pack, and locale are installed. German technology web site tecchannel.de published an analysis of the Windows Update communication protocol in February 2003, which received wide attention on technology web sites. The report, which was the first to contain extensive details of how the Windows Update communication protocol worked, also discovered that the make and model of the computer, the amount of free disk space, and the Windows [[product key]], were sent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/28/windows_update_keeps_tabs/ |title=Windows Update keeps tabs on all system software |last=Leyden |first=John |date=February 28, 2003 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |publisher=The Register }}</ref> {{-}} ===Critical Update Notification Tool/Utility=== [[File:Windows 98 - Critical Update Notification.jpg|right|thumb|Screenshot of the Critical Update Notification tool in Windows 98.]] Shortly after the release of Windows 98, Microsoft released a '''Critical Update Notification Tool''' (later called '''Critical Update Notification Utility''' to avoid the unfortunate acronym<ref>{{cite news|last=Schofield |first=Jack |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2002/mar/30/andfinallyjof |title=And finally, JOF spotted that &#124; Technology &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2002-03-30|accessdate=2010-04-23 | location=London}}</ref>) through Windows Update, which installed a background tool on the user's computer that checked the Windows Update web site on a regular schedule for new updates that have been marked as "Critical". By default, this check occurred every five minutes, and when Internet Explorer was started, though the user could configure the next check to occur only at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week. The check was performed by querying the server for a file, "cucif.cab", which contains a list of all the critical updates released for the user's operating system. The Critical Update Notification Tool then compared this list with the list of installed updates on the user's machine, and displayed a message to the user informing them of new critical updates if they were available. Once the check executed, any custom schedule defined by the user was reverted to the default; Microsoft stated that this was by design in order to ensure that users received notification of critical updates in a timely manner.<ref name="cun-kb">{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q224420/ |title=Description of the Windows Critical Update Notification Utility (MSKB244420) |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=Knowledge Base |publisher=[[Microsoft]] }}</ref> An analysis done by security researcher H D Moore in early 1999
