[[Image:MLS shiftregisters L4.png|thumbnail|350px|right|Figure 1: The next value of register ''a''<sub>3</sub> in a feedback shift register of length 4 is determined by the modulo-2 sum of ''a''<sub>0</sub> and ''a''<sub>1</sub>.]] MLS are generated using maximal linear feedback shift registers. An MLS-generating system with a shift register of length 4 is shown in Fig. 1. It can be expressed using the following recursive relation: :<math>a_k[n+1] = \begin{cases} a_0[n] + a_1[n], & k = 3 \\ a_{k+1}[n], & \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases} </math> where ''n'' is the time index, ''k'' is the bit register position, and <math>+</math> represents [[Modular arithmetic|modulo-2]] addition. As MLS are periodic and shift registers cycle through every possible binary value (with the exception of the zero vector), registers can be initialized to any state, with the exception of the zero vector. ===Polynomial interpretation=== A [[polynomial]] over [[Galois field|GF(2)]] can be associated with the linear feedback shift register. It has degree of the length of the shift register, and has coefficients that are either 0 or 1, corresponding to the taps of the register that feed the [[xor]] gate. For example, the polynomial corresponding to Fig. 1 is ''x''<sup>4</sup> + ''x''<sup>1</sup> + 1. A necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence generated by a LFSR to be maximal length is that its corresponding polynomial be [[primitive polynomial|primitive]]. ===Implementation=== MLS are inexpensive to implement in hardware or software, and relatively low-order feedback shift registers can generate long sequences; a sequence generated using a shift register of length 20 is 2<sup>20</sup> &minus; 1 samples long (1,048,575 samples). ==Properties of maximum length sequences== MLS have the following properties, as formulated by [[Solomon Golomb]]. <ref name="golumb">Golomb, S. ''Shift Register Sequences'', San Francisco, Holden&ndash;Day, 1967. ISBN 0894120484</ref> ===Balance property=== The number of "1"s in the sequence is one greater than the number of "0"s. ===Run property=== Of all the "runs" in the sequence of each type (i.e. runs consisting of "1"s and runs consisting of "0"s): * One half of the runs are of length 1. * One quarter of the runs are of length 2. * One eighth of the runs are of length 3. * ... etc. ... A "run" is a sub-sequence of "1"s or "0"s within the MLS concerned. The number of runs is the number of such sub-sequences. ===Correlation property=== The [[autocorrelation]] function of an MLS is a very close approximation to a train of [[Kronecker delta]] function. ==Extraction of impulse responses== If a [[LTI system theory|linear time invariant]] (LTI) system's impulse response is to be measured using a MLS, the response can be extracted from the measured system output ''y''[''n''] by taking its circular cross-correlation with the MLS. This is because the [[autocorrelation]] of a MLS is 1 for zero-lag, and nearly zero (&minus;1/''N'' where ''N'' is the sequence length) for all other lags; in other words, the autocorrelation of the MLS can be said to approach unit impulse function as MLS length increases. If the impulse response of a system is ''h''[''n''] and the MLS is ''s''[''n''], then :<math>y[n] = (h*s)[n].\,</math> Taking the cross-correlation with respect to ''s''[''n''] of both sides, :<math>{\phi}_{sy} = h[n]*{\phi}_{ss}\,</math> and assuming that φ<sub>''ss''</sub> is an impulse (valid for long sequences) :<math>h[n] = {\phi}_{sy}.\,</math> <!-- had to do the above in a rush. not entirely accurate!--> ==Relationship to Hadamard transform== Cohn and Lempel <ref name="cohn">Cohn, M. and Lempel, A. ''On Fast M-Sequence Transforms'', IEEE Trans. Information Theory, vol. IT-23, pp. 135&ndash;137, January, 1977.</ref> showed the relationship of the MLS to the [[Hadamard transform]]. This relationship allows the [[correlation]] of an MLS to be computed in a fast algorithm similar to the [[FFT]]. ==See also== * [[Impulse response]] * [[Frequency response]] * [[Polynomial ring]] * [[Federal Standard 1037C]] * [[Gold code]] * [[Complementary sequences]] ==References== *Solomon W.

The cup will usually have a scale marked in cups and fractions of a cup, and often with fluid measure and weight of a selection of dry foodstuffs. Measuring cups are also used to measure washing powder, liquid detergents or bleach, usually with a measuring cup not also used for food. Measuring cups may be made of [[plastic]], glass, or metal. Maximum capacity usually ranges from 0.2 to 1 litre, though larger sizes are also available (for commercial use). Smaller [[measuring spoon]]s lack a scale and are filled and leveled to maximum capacity. Its mostly used to measure things such as flour, water, or any type of liquid. ==Capacity and scale== Measuring cups usually have capacities from 250 (approx. 1 [[cup (volume)|cup]]) to 1000 mL (approx. 4 cups = 2 pints = 1 quart), though larger sizes are also available (for commercial use). They usually have scale markings at different heights: the substance being measured is added to the cup until it reaches the wanted level. Dry measure cups without a scale are sometimes used, in sets typically of 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1 cup. [[Transparent materials|Transparent or translucent]] cups can be read
