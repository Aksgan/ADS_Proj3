language|Swedish]] was the ancestor of the [[Germanic languages]]. He puzzled over the origins of the [[Slavic languages]], was aware of the existence of [[Sanskrit]], and was fascinated by [[classical Chinese]]. He published the ''princeps editio'' (first modern edition) of the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] ''[[Chronicon Holtzatiae]]'', a Latin chronicle of the [[County of Holstein]]. ==Sinophile== Leibniz was perhaps the first major European intellect to take a close interest in [[China|Chinese]] civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other work by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. He concluded that Europeans could learn much from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the [[Chinese character]]s were an unwitting form of his [[Characteristica universalis|universal characteristic]]. He noted with fascination how the ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams correspond to the [[binary numbers]] from 0 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.<ref>On Leibniz, the ''I Ching'', and binary numbers, see Aiton (1985: 245–48). Leibniz's writings on Chinese civilization are collected and translated in Cook and Rosemont (1994), and discussed in Perkins (2004).</ref> == As polymath == While making his grand tour of European archives to research the Brunswick family history that he never completed, Leibniz stopped in [[Vienna]] between May 1688 and February 1689, where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the Brunswicks. He visited mines, talked with mine engineers, and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the [[Harz mountains]]. His proposal that the streets of Vienna be lit with lamps burning [[rapeseed oil]] was implemented. During a formal audience with the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Austrian Emperor]] and in subsequent memoranda, he advocated reorganizing the Austrian economy, reforming the coinage of much of central Europe, negotiating a [[Concordat]] between the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and creating an imperial research library, official archive, and public insurance fund. He wrote and published an important paper on [[mechanics]]. Leibniz also wrote a short paper, first published by [[Louis Couturat]] in 1903,<ref>Later translated as Loemker 267 and Woolhouse and Francks 30</ref> summarizing his views on [[metaphysics]]. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90. Couturat's reading of this paper was the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]]. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out. ==Posthumous reputation== === As a mathematician and philosopher === When Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the ''[[Théodicée]]'', whose supposed central argument [[Voltaire]] lampooned in his ''[[Candide]]''. Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his ''Candide'' bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced [[David Hume]] who read his ''[[Théodicée]]'' and used some of his ideas<ref>[http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v19n1/vasilyeu/vasilyeu-v19n1.pdf Vasilyev, 1993]</ref> In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized. Much of Europe came to doubt that Leibniz had discovered the calculus independently of Newton, and hence his whole work in mathematics and physics was neglected. Voltaire, an admirer of Newton, also wrote ''Candide'' at least in part to discredit Leibniz's claim to having discovered the calculus and Leibniz's charge that Newton's theory of universal gravitation was incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The rise of relativity and subsequent work in the history of mathematics has put Leibniz's stance in a more favorable light. Leibniz's long march to his present glory began with the 1765 publication of the ''Nouveaux Essais'', which [[Kant]] read closely. In 1768, Dutens edited the first multi-volume edition of Leibniz's writings, followed in the 19th century by a number of editions, including those edited by Erdmann, Foucher de Careil, Gerhardt, Gerland, Klopp, and Mollat. Publication of Leibniz's correspondence with notables such as [[Antoine Arnauld]], [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Sophia of Hanover]], and her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]], began. In 1900, [[Bertrand Russell]] published a critical study of Leibniz's [[metaphysics]].<ref>Russell, 1900</ref> Shortly thereafter, [[Louis Couturat]] published an important study of Leibniz, and edited a volume of Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] and [[linguistic philosophy|linguistic]] philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as [[Bernhard Riemann]]). For example, Leibniz's phrase ''[[salva veritate]]'', meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in [[Willard Quine]]'s writings. Nevertheless, the secondary English-language literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This is especially true of English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to [[Leroy Loemker]] (1904–85) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973). [[Nicholas Jolley]] has surmised that Leibniz's reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive.<ref>Jolley, 217–19</ref> Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[Principle of individuation|individuation]], and [[possible worlds]], while the doctrinaire contempt for metaphysics, characteristic of analytic and linguistic philosophy, has faded{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century [[history of ideas|ideas]] has revealed more clearly the 17th-century "Intellectual Revolution" that preceded the better-known [[industrial revolution|Industrial]] and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.
