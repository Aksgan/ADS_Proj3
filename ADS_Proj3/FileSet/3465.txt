predictions are backed up by arguments from [[quantum field theory]] and [[quantum gravitation]], and include predicted numerical values for the exponents. Most of these predictions are conjectural except when the number ''d'' of dimensions satisfies either ''d'' = 2 or ''d'' ≥ 19. They include: * There are no infinite clusters (open or closed) * The probability that there is an open path from some fixed point (say the origin) to a distance of ''r'' decreases ''polynomially'', i.e. is [[big O notation|on the order of]] ''r''<sup> ''α''</sup> for some ''α'' ** ''α'' does not depend on the particular lattice chosen, or on other local parameters. It depends only on value of the dimension ''d'' (this is an instance of the [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] principle). ** ''α''<sub>''d''</sub> decreases from ''d'' = 2 until ''d'' = 6 and then stays fixed. ** ''α''<sub>6</sub> = &minus;1 ** ''α''<sub>2</sub> = &minus;5/48. * The shape of a large cluster in two dimensions is [[conformal map|conformally invariant]]. See {{harvtxt|Grimmett|1999}}. In dimension ≥ 19, these facts are largely proved using a technique known as the [[lace expansion]]. It is believed that a version of the lace expansion should be valid for 7 or more dimensions, perhaps with implications also for the threshold case of 6 dimensions. The connection of percolation to the lace expansion is found in {{harvtxt|Hara|Slade|1990}}. In dimension 2, the first fact ("no percolation in the critical phase") is proved for many lattices, using duality. Substantial progress has been made on two-dimensional percolation through the conjecture of [[Oded Schramm]] that the [[scaling limit]] of a large cluster may be described in terms of a [[Schramm&ndash;Loewner evolution]]. This conjecture was proved by {{harvtxt|Smirnov|2001}} at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in the special case of site percolation on the triangular lattice. ==Different models== *The first model studied was [[Bernoulli percolation]]. In this model all bonds are independent. This model is called bond percolation by physicists. *A generalization next was introduced as the [[Fortuin–Kasteleyn random cluster model]], which has many connections with the [[Ising model]] and other [[Potts model]]s. *Bernoulli (bond) percolation on [[complete graph]]s is an example of a [[random graph]]. The critical probability is ''p'' = 1/''N''. *[[Directed percolation]], which has connections with the [[contact process (mathematics)|contact process]]. *[[First passage percolation]]. *[[Invasion percolation]]. <!-- LOTS of todo!
