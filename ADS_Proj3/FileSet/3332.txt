The concept thus represents a departure from, and an alternative to, the incumbent [[anonymous peer review]] process, in which non-disclosure of these identities toward the public - and toward the authors of the work under review - is default practice. The open peer review concept appears to constitute a response to modern criticisms of the incumbent system; ergo, its emergence may be partially attributed to these phenomena. ==Rationale== The traditional [[anonymous peer review]] has been criticized for its lack of accountability, possibility of abuse by reviewers, its possible bias and inconsistency,<ref>[http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/123/9/1964 Reproducibility of peer review in clinical neuroscience: Is agreement between reviewers any greater than would be expected by chance alone? - Rothwell and Martyn 123 (9): 1964 - Brain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> alongside other flaws.<ref>[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/uploaded_documents/rowland.pdf The Peer Review Process<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[Alison McCook]] | title = Is Peer Review Broken? | journal = [[The Scientist]] | month = February | year = 2006 | url = http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/23061/ }}</ref> Both processes are intended to subject scholarly publications to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field. The evidence of the effect of open peer review upon the quality of reviews, the tone and the time spent on reviewing is mixed, although it does seem that under open peer review, more of those who are invited to review decline to do so.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/318/7175/23?ijkey=8feca9dda2f29a07ec06f70a661120c97578c339&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha Effect of open peer review on quality of reviews and on reviewers' recommendations: a randomised trial - van Rooyen et al. 318 (7175): 23 - BMJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1192/bjp.176.1.47 | title = Open peer review: a randomised controlled trial | author = Elizabeth Walsh, Maeve Rooney, Louis Appleby, Greg Wilkinson | volume = 176 | issue = 1 | pages = 47&ndash;51 | journal = The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | year = 2000 | pmid = 10789326 }}</ref> ==History== A number of reputable medical publishers
