signal lines were pulled up to +5V by 220 [[Ohm]] [[resistor]], and pulled down to ground by 330 [[Ohm]] resistor. This allowed usage of longer cables comparing to [[Centronics]], but overloaded most usual '''Centronics''' adapters. Some devices allowed switching between '''IFSP''' and '''Centronics''' modes, i.e. [[Robotron]] 6319—6329 were manufactured with interchangeable interface modules, allowed usage of '''IFSP''', [[IFSS]] and [[Centronics]]. == Signal description == {| class="wikitable" |+Centronics—IFSP connection |- !

It is developed by [[WaveMetrics|WaveMetrics Inc.]], and was originally aimed at [[time series]] analysis, but has since then evolved and covers other applications such as [[curve fitting]] and [[image processing]]. It comes with a comprehensive [[programming language]] with [[compiler]], but many functions are also accessible through [[Menu (computing)|menus]]. IGOR Pro's strengths include its graphics capabilities, and the possibility of extending the built-in functions with external operations (XOP) allowing [[data acquisition]], manipulation and analysis features, communication with external devices and in principle any other task that can be programmed in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]]. == Community == Complementing the professional development and support provided by WaveMetrics, a broad community of users and enthusiast provide user-to-user support through a mailing list and IgorExchange, a collaborative web site sponsored by WaveMetrics which main features are a forum and places where programmers can share extensions, complete projects or "code snippets". == See also == *[[List of graphing software]] == External links == * [http://www.wavemetrics.com Wavemetrics Inc.] (manufacturer) * [http://www.igorexchange.com/ IgorExchange] Projects, extensions and code share. * [http://igorlist.blogspot.com/ Igor mailing list] Unofficial archive of Igor mailing list {{science-software-stub}} [[Category:Plotting software]] [[ja:IGOR Pro]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17552</id> <title>ILAsm</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''ILAsm''' (IL Assembler) generates a [[portable executable]] (PE) file from [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL) code.
