It is a diagnostic tool that helps researchers/teachers gain insight into the reading process. The term "miscue" was initiated by Ken Goodman to describe an observed response in the reading process that does not match the expected response. Goodman uses the term "[[miscue]]," rather than "[[error]]" or "[[mistake]]" to avoid [[value (ethics)|value]] implications. He states that the departures from the text are not necessarily a negative aspect of the reading process but rather "windows on the reading process" (Goodman, 1969, p. 123). ==Studies== Miscue analysis procedures include the collection and examination of a single and complete oral reading experience followed by a [[retelling]]. The procedures and standards are outlined in both the ''Goodman Taxonomy'' and the ''Reading Miscue Inventory'' (Goodman, Watson, & Burke, 2005). Miscue analysis differs significantly from other laboratory-centered or experimental diagnostic and evaluative instruments in that miscue research studies reading in as natural a condition as possible, with readers orally reading authentic and complete [[narrative|stories]] they have not been exposed to before. In this way, miscue analysis provides a naturalistic viewpoint and the resulting analysis of reading proficiency is both [[qualitative property|qualitative]] and [[quantitative property|quantitative]]. To date, hundreds of studies on miscue analysis have been conducted from different perspectives to explore the reading process, to evaluate readers, and to improve reading instruction (Brown, Goodman, & Marek, 1996). Although their foci are different, these studies have generally confirmed Goodman's
