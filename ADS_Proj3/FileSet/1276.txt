The integration efforts will be driven by an expanding set of test problems representing key issues for bioinformatics service providers and end-user biologists. As a result, groups throughout Europe will be able to use the EMBRACE service interfaces for their own local or proprietary data and tools. EMBRACE makes many ready-to-go [[bioinformatics]] [[web services]] freely available to the international research community. The project is run from the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] in [[Hinxton]], [[England]]. Fred Marcus is its [[EU]] project coordinator. The EMBRACE project is funded by the [[European Commission]] within its FP6 Programme, under the thematic area "Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health", contract number LHSG-CT-2004-512092. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.embracegrid.info/ EMBRACE portal] * [http://www.embracegrid.info/page.php?page=partners EMBRACE partners] [[Category:Bioinformatics]] [[Category:Grid computing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11433</id> <title>EMC Aware Programming</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|expert=Computer science|context=February 2009|onesource=August 2009|date=October 2009}} '''[[Electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) Aware Programming''' involves writing [[software]] which is resilient to errors induced by [[electromagnetic fields]]. ==Motivation== [[Image:Cost per Product using HW SW protection.png||thumbnail|right|250px|Cost per product using hardware or software EMC protection.]] [[Microcontrollers]] have low immunity [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]] resulting in a very high rate of [[Transient (electricity)|transient]] errors and a potential for processor failure. To improve the immunity towards electromagnetic fields, extra [[hardware]] devices are often used. Hardware protection requires additional circuitry which adds cost, weight and size to a device. Many hardware techniques focus only on the prevention of failures and have no means of recovering from these errors once they occur.{{Verify source|date=September 2007}} The [[Software engineering|software approach]] consists in investigating the possibilities of using defensive software techniques as protection against [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] disturbances as it is an economically interesting solution. The same software mechanisms could be used for a wide range of applications and different [[Platform (computing)|platforms]]. The figure to the right shows why a software approach is economically attractive. Adding hardware will add extra costs to each device while appropriate software is developed only once and then replicated. ==See also== *[[EMC Fundamentals]] *[[Emission Aware Programming]] *[[Immunity Aware Programming]] *[[List of EMC directives]] *[[Electromagnetic compatibility]] ==References== {{Reflist}} * [http://www.conformity.com/artman/publish/printer_214.shtml "The EMC Impact of Embedded Software"] by Martin Oâ€™Hara 2007 [[Category:Electromagnetic compatibility]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11438</id> <title>EMILE</title> <text>{{ Infobox Software | name = EMILE | screenshot = [[Image:EMILE.jpg]] | caption = EMILE booting Macintosh SE/30 | developer = [[Laurent Vivier]] | latest_release_version = 0.12 | latest_release_date = July 29, 2008 | genre = [[Bootloader]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]] | website = http://emile.sourceforge.net }} '''EMILE''' is the Early [[Macintosh|Mac]] Image LoadEr, a bootloader for loading [[Linux]] on Macintosh computers that have [[m68k]] processors.
