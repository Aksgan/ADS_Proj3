tool for editing vocabularies in VDEX format. The project, which ended in January 2004, was based on the Public Draft (not the current Final Specification) [http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/vdex]. The '''VDEX Java Binding''' defines an implementation neutral Java interface for VDEX, as well as providing a default implementation of that interface, and XML marshalling functionality [http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdex-j/]. The '''imsvdex Python egg''' is an access API for vdex-files, written by Bibilotheka Hertziana, Max-Planck Institute of Art-History, Rome. This free software project is implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/imsvdex]. '''ATVocabularyManager''' of the [[Plone]] CMS project uses VDEX together with the imsvdex Python egg as a possible format to define vocabularies. [http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager]. '''collective.vdexvocabulary''' implements IMS VDEX as standard [[Zope]] vocabulary which can also be used in [[Plone]] CMS.
