It was awarded the [[Hugo Award]] and the [[Nebula Award]] for best science fiction novelette of 1976. According to the foreword in ''Robot Visions'', Asimov was approached to write a story titled "Bicentennial Man" for a science fiction collection, along with a number of other authors who would do the same, in honor of the bicentennial of the United States. However, the arrangement fell through, leaving Asimov's the only story actually completed for the project. The story formed the basis of the novel ''[[The Positronic Man]]'' (1993), co-written with [[Robert Silverberg]], and the 1999 film ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]]. ==Plot summary== In the 21st century the creation of the [[positronic brain]] leads to the development of robot laborers and revolutionizes life on Earth. But to the Martin family, their household robot NDR-113 (NDR-114 in the film version) is more than a mechanical servant. "Andrew" has become a trusted friend, a confidant, and a member of the Martin family. The story is told from the perspective of '''Andrew''' (later known as '''Andrew Martin'''), an NDR-series [[robot]] owned by the Martin family, a departure from the usual practice by [[U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men]] of leasing robots. Andrew's initial experiences with the Martin family are replete with awkward moments which demonstrate his lack of [[socialization]]. However, he is much better with inanimate objects and animals and begins to display [[Sapience|sapient]] characteristics (such as creativity; emotion; self-awareness) traditionally the province of humans. He is taken off his mundane household duties, for which he was intended, and allowed to pursue his creativity, making a fortune by selling his creations. Andrew seeks legal protection stemming from his initial creative output and eventual full recognition as a human, by gradually replacing his robotic components with organic ones, and citing the process as a transformation from robot to human. Succeeding generations of the Martin family assist him in his quest for humanity, but each is limited to what degree they are prepared to acknowledge. Only when Andrew allows his positronic brain to "decay", thereby willfully abandoning his immortality, is he finally accepted as a human being. This event takes place on the two-hundredth anniversary of his construction, hence the title. ==Foundation universe== This story is set within Asimov's [[Foundation (novel)|''Foundation'' universe]], which also includes his earlier [[Susan Calvin]] positronic robot tales. It is clearly set a number of centuries prior to the events of his novelette "[[Mother Earth (novelette)|Mother Earth]]" and the novel ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', during a period in which the [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacer]] worlds have yet to turn against the people of the Earth, and in which the [[U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men|U.S. Robots]] corporation is still active. In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', Dr. Han Fastolfe refers to Andrew Martin as a robot that was supposed to have undergone "gradual humanization," but states that such a thing would have been impossible, because the shape of the body dictates the state of the mind. ==References== {{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IxtL54iiDPUC&printsec=frontcover#PPA381,M1 |title=Robot Evolution |author=Mark E.
