It began as an attempt to catalogue shark attacks on servicemen during [[World War II]]. The [[Office of Naval Research]] funded it from 1958 until 1968. During that time a panel of shark experts developed a standard system for collecting accounts of shark attacks from around the world. The file was temporarily housed at the [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] in Sarasota, Florida until a permanent home was found at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], University of Florida. It is currently under the direction of members of the [[American Elasmobranch Society]], including [[George H. Burgess]]. The file contains information on over 4,000 shark attacks and includes detailed, often privileged, information including autopsy reports and graphic photos. The file is accessible only to scientists whose access is permitted only by a review board. ==External links== *[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/isaf/isafabout.htm International Shark Attack File] * [http://sharkattacksurvivors.com/wiki/index.html Shark Attack Survivors World Wide Shark Attack File] Online Interactive Shark Attack Database * [http://www.sharkattackfile.net/ Global Shark Attack File...
