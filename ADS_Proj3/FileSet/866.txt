Eventually, Marsh<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Marsh S. | title = Formalizing Trust as a Computational Concept. | publisher = PhD thesis, University of Stirling, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics. | year = 1994}}</ref> addressed the issue of formalizing trust as a computational concept in his PhD thesis. His trust model is based on social and psychological factors. ===Trust model classification=== A lot of proposals have appeared in the literature and here a selection of computational trust and reputation models, that represent a good sample of the current research, is presented.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Sabater J., Sierra C. | title = Review on Computational Trust and Reputation Models. | publisher = Artificial Intelligence Review, 24:33-60, Springer. | year = 2005}}</ref> Trust and reputation can be analysed from different points of view and can be applied in many situations. The next classification is based considering the peculiar characteristics of these models and the environment where they evolve. ====Conceptual model==== Trust and reputation model can be characterized as: * [[Cognitive]] In models based on a cognitive approach, Trust and reputation are made up of underlying beliefs and are a function of the degree of these beliefs.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Esfandiari B., Chandrasekharan S. | title = On How Agents Make Friends: Mechanism for Trust Acquisition. | publisher = In proocedings of the Fourth Workshop on Deception Fraud and Trust in Agent Societies, Montreal, Canada. pp. 27-34. | year = 2001}}</ref> The mental states, that lead to trust another agent or to assign a reputation, are an essential part of the model, as well as the mental consequences of the decision and the act of relying on another agent; * [[game theory|Game-theoretical]] Trust and reputation are considered subjective probabilities by which the individual A, expects the individual B to perform a given action on which its welfare depends.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Gambetta D. | title = Can We Trust Trust? | publisher = In. Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations. Chapt. Can We Trust Trust? Basil Blackwell, Oxford, pp. 213-237. }}</ref> In this approach, trust and reputation are not the result of a mental state of the agent in a cognitive sense, but the result of a more pragmatic game with utility functions and numerical aggregation of past interactions. ====Information sources==== It is possible to sort out models by considering the information sources used to compute Trust and reputation values. The traditional information sources are direct experiences and witness information, but recent models have started to consider the connection between information and the sociological aspect of agent’s behavior. When the model contains several information sources it can increase the reliability of the results, but conversely, it can increases the complexity of the model. =====Direct experiences===== Direct experience is the most relevant and reliable information source for a Trust/reputation model. Two types of direct experiences can be recognizable: * the experience based on the direct interaction with the interlocutor; * the experience based on the observed interaction of the other members of a community. =====Witness information===== Witness information, also called indirect information, is what comes from the experience of other members of community. It can be based on their own direct experiences or on other data they gathered from others’ experience. Witness information is usually the most abundant but its use is complex for Trust and reputation model. In fact, it introduces uncertainty and agents can manipulate or hide parts of the information for their own benefit. =====Sociological information===== In real world, people that belong to a community establish different types of relations among them. Each individual plays one or several roles in that society, influencing their behavior and the interaction with other people. In a multi-agent system, where there are plenty of interactions, the social relations among agents are a simplified reflection of a more complex relation which is among their human counterparts. Only a few Trust and reputation models adopt this sociological information, using techniques like [[social network]] analysis. These methods study social relationships among individuals in a society that emerged as a set of methods for the analysis of social structures, methods that specifically allow an investigation of the relational aspects of these structures.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Scott J. | title = Social Network Analysis. | publisher = SAGE Publications. http://www.analytictech.com/mb119/tableof.htm }}</ref> =====Prejudice===== Prejudice is another, though uncommon, mechanism that has a sensible influence on trust and reputation. According to this method, an individual is given properties that are peculiar of a particular group and that make him recognisable as a member of this group. These signs can be everything like a uniform, a concrete behavior, etc.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Bacharach M., Gambetta D., | title = Trust in Society. | publisher = Chapt. Trust in signs. Russel Sage Foundation, . | year = 2001}}</ref> As most people today use the word, ''[[prejudice]]'' refers to a negative or hostile attitude towards another social group, usually racially defined. However, this negative connotation has to be revised when applied to agent communities. The set of signs used in computational trust and reputations models are usually out of the ethical discussion, differently from the signs used in human societies, like skin color or sex. ==Discussion on Trust/Reputation models== The most relevant sources of information considered by the trust and [[reputation system|reputation models]] presented before, are direct experiences and witness information. In the actual e-markets, the sociological information is almost non-existent and, in order to increase the efficiency of actual Trust and reputation models,
