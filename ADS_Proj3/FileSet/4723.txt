Y. Chu. The company was successively headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] (1954–1963), [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]] (1963–1976), and finally in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] (1976–1997). At its peak in the 1980s, Wang Laboratories had annual revenues of $3 billion and employed over 40,000 people. The company was always directed by Dr. Wang, who played a personal role in setting business strategy and product strategy; he also took steps to ensure that the Wang family would retain control of the company even after going public. He created a second class of stock, class B, with higher dividends, but only one-tenth the voting power of class C. The public mostly bought class B shares; the Wang family retained most of the class C shares. (The letters B and C were used to ensure that brokerages would fill any Wang stock orders with class B shares unless class C was specifically requested). Wang stock had been listed in the [[New York Stock Exchange]], but this maneuver was not quite acceptable under NYSE's rules, and Wang was forced to delist with NYSE and relist on the more liberal [[American Stock Exchange]]. Under his direction, the company went through several distinct transitions between different product lines. Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1992. After emerging from bankruptcy, the company eventually changed its name to '''Wang Global'''. In 1999, Wang Global was acquired by [[Getronics]] of The Netherlands. == Typesetters == The company's first major project was the [[Linasec]] in 1964. It was an electronic special purpose computer, designed to justify papertape for use on automated [[Linotype machine]]s. It was developed under contract to [[Compugraphic]], who manufactured [[phototypesetting|phototypesetters]]. Compugraphic retained the rights to manufacture the Linasec without royalty. They exercised these rights, effectively forcing Wang out of the market. ==Calculators== The [[Wang LOCI-2]] (an earlier LOCI-1 was not a real product) was introduced in 1965 and was probably the first desktop calculator capable of computing logarithms, quite an achievement for a machine without any integrated circuits.<ref name = "Wang Ad 1966">{{Citation | last = Wang Laboratories | title = Now you can determine Copolymer Composition in a few minutes at your desk | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 13 | pages = 62A–63A | date = December 1966 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac50155a005 | doi = 10.1021/ac50155a005 }}</ref> The electronics included 1275 discrete transistors. It actually performed multiplication by adding logarithms, and roundoff in the display conversion was noticeable: 2 times 2 yielded 3.999999999. From 1965 to about 1971, Wang was a well-regarded calculator company. Wang calculators cost in the mid-four-figures,<ref>US$3,000 to US$6,000</ref> used [[Nixie tube]] readouts, performed transcendental functions, had varying degrees of programmability, and exploited [[magnetic core memory]] in ingenious ways. One model had a central processing unit (the size of a small suitcase) connected by cables leading to four individual desktop display/keyboard units. Competition included [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], which introduced the [[Hewlett-Packard 9100A|HP 9100A]] in 1968, and old-line calculator companies such as [[Monroe Calculator Company|Monroe]] and [[Marchant]]. One little documented "feature" of these calculators was that you could predictably lock-up the calculator display heads, getting the Nixie tube display to endlessly "roll" numbers, by entering the sequence 30311142.59 [Enter] 99 [Enter] 9 [Enter]. Wang calculators were at first sold to scientists and engineers, but the company later won a solid niche in financial-services industries, which had previously relied on complicated printed tables for mortgages and annuities. One perhaps apocryphal story tells of a banker who spot-checked a Wang calculator against a mortgage table and found a discrepancy. The calculator was right, the printed tables were wrong, and the company's reputation was made. In the early seventies, Dr. Wang believed that calculators would become unprofitable low-margin commodities, and decided to exit the calculator business. ==Word Processors== ===The Wang 1200=== Wang's first attempt at a [[word processor]] was the Wang 1200, announced in late 1971, but not available until 1972. The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator hooked up to an OEM-manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for keying and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage.
