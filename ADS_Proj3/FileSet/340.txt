Since the passing of these laws 11 years ago, there have been no repeat crimes. In the wake of an ATM Murder in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, The City Council of Sharon Hill passed an ATM Consumer Security Bill as well, with the same result. As of July 2009, ATM Consumer Security Legislation is currently pending in New York, New Jersey, and Washington D.C. In China, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive CCTV coverage, an emergency telephone and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that aren't guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping your bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify who enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them. ===Alternative uses=== [[Image:Dual currency cash machines in Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Two NCR Personas 84 ATMs at a [[bank]] in [[Jersey]] dispensing two types of [[pound sterling]] banknotes: [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England notes]] on the left, and [[Jersey pound|States of Jersey notes]] on the right]] Although ATMs were originally developed as just cash dispensers, they have evolved to include many other bank-related functions. In some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank ATM network (e.g.: [[Multibanco]] in Portugal), ATMs include many functions which are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as: * Deposit currency recognition, acceptance, and recycling<ref>[http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=15827&site=5&prc= Rising interest rates, gas prices hit vault-cash providers]</ref><ref>[http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2004/20040318.html NCR and Fujitsu Develop Cash Deposit and Bill Recycling Module for ATMs] [[Fujitsu]]</ref> * Paying routine bills, fees, and taxes (utilities, phone bills, social security, legal fees, taxes, etc.) * Printing [[bank statement]]s * Updating [[passbook]]s * Loading monetary value into [[stored value card]]s * Purchasing ** [[Postage stamp]]s. ** [[Lottery]] tickets ** [[Public transport#Ticket systems|Train tickets]] ** Concert tickets ** Movie tickets ** [[Shopping mall]] [[gift certificate]]s. * Games and promotional features<ref> * Fastloans * CRM at the ATM [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4700053.stm Bank puts the 'fun' into 'funds' ] [[BBC]] article about [[Ogaki Kyoritsu Bank]] ATMs]</ref> * Donating to charities<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4597692.stm "Indonesians make ATM sacrifices" Bank puts the 'fun' into 'funds'] [[BBC]] article about purchasing livestock for the poor in [[Indonesia]]</ref> * Cheque Processing Module * Adding pre-paid [[cell phone]] / [[mobile phone]] credit. * Paying (in full or partially) the credit balance on a card linked to a specific [[current account]]. Increasingly banks are seeking to use the ATM as a sales device to deliver pre approved loans and targeted advertising using products such as ITM (the Intelligent Teller Machine) from CR2 or Aptra Relate from NCR.
