these communities respond with each other. By using known data of preexisting invasive species GIS models could predict future outbreaks by comparing biological factors. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Invasive Aquatic Species Program (CAES IAPP) is using GIS to evaluate risk factors. GIS allows managers to [[georeference]] plant locations and abundance. This allows for managers to display invasive communities alongside native species for study and management. ==See also== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==External links== *[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/ConservationGIS/default.cfm Smithsonian National Zoological Park] *[http://infolink.cr.usgs.gov/ Missouri River InfoLINK] *[http://biology.usgs.gov/faer/FAB/2006/FABOct2006.pdf Fisheries and Aquatics Bulletin] *[http://www.cerc.usgs.gov/ Columbia Environmental Research Center] *[http://www.fish.state.pa.us/anglerboater/2000/maju00/gisconsv.htm Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for Fish Conservation] *[http://www.edc.uri.edu/nrs/classes/NRS409/509_2004/Brooke.pdf GIS and Fish Population Dynamics] *[http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/spring08articles/lake-management.html ArcNews Online] *[http://www.ct.gov/caes/cwp/view.asp?a=2799&q=376972&caesNav_GID=1805&caesNav= THE CONNECTICUT AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION INVASIVE AQUATIC PLANT PROGRAM (CAES IAPP)] *[http://www.ct.gov/caes/LIB/caes/Documents/Aquatic_Plants/ESRI_abstract.pdf Using GIS to Map Invasive Aquatic Plants in Connecticut Lakes] *[http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/management/dss/sub_veg_model.html Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center] *[http://www.fort.usgs.gov/SmartRiverGIS/ Smart River GIS for Improved Decision Making] {{aquatic ecosystem topics|state=expanded}} {{fishery science topics}} [[Category:Geographic information systems]] [[Category:Fisheries science]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14555</id> <title>GLite-AMGA</title> <text>{{ infobox software | name = AMGA | logo = [[File:GLite logo.png]] | screenshot = | caption = | developer = S.

Santos and B. Koblitz: Metadata services on the Grid, Nucl. Inst. & Meth. in Phys. Res. A 559(2006) pp 53-56.</ref> is a general purpose [[metadata]] catalogue and part of the [[gLite]] [[middleware]] distribution. It was developed by the EGEE project, when it became clear that many [[Grid computing|Grid]] applications needed metadata information on files and to organize a work-flow.<ref>N. Santos and B. Koblitz, Metadata services on the grid, in Proc. of Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques (ACAT'05), Zeuthen, Berlin, May 2005</ref> AMGA is now developed and supported by a collaboration of [[CERN]], [[INFN]] in Catania and KISTI in Korea. AMGA as a metadata services allows users to attach metadata information to files stored on the Grid, where metadata can be any relationally organized data typically stored in a relational database system ([[RDBMS]]). In addition, the metadata in AMGA can also be stored independently of any associated files, which allows to use AMGA as a general access tool to relational databases on the Grid. AMGA features a simple to learn metadata access language, which has been very useful for the adoption of AMGA in smaller Grid applications, as it lowers the technical hurdle to make use of relational data considerably. Of course also access via SQL92 is supported. One of the main features of AMGA and unique to it, is the possibility to replicate metadata between different AMGA instances allowing the federation of metadata <ref>N. Santos and B. Koblitz, Distributed Metadata with the AMGA Metadata Catalog, in the proceedings of the Workshop on Next-Generation Distributed Data Management HPDC-15, Paris, France, June 2006</ref> (e.g. By the Health-e-child project), but also to increase the scalability and improve the access times on a globally deployed Grid (as done by the Wisdom project). Performance and efficiency of the access across WANs has been independently targeted by an access protocol optimsed for the bulk transfer of metadata across WANs using data streaming. Security on the Grid is a major concern and AMGA features different authentication methods via (Grid-Proxy-) Certificates as well as very flexible accesses control mechanisms for individual data items based on ACLs.<ref>N. Santos and B. Koblitz, Security in distributed metadata catalogue, Concurrency and Computation: Practice & Experience 20 (2008), pp 1995-2007</ref> In particular these security features have made AMGA the de facto standard for metadata and relational database access on the Grid for biomedical applications. Prominent projects making use of AMGA in this field are [http://wisdom.eu-egee.fr Wisdom] where AMGA was used in both their campaigns against Avian Flu and malaria, and the Health e-Child project. ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://cern.ch/amga/ AMGA homepage] * [http://www.health-e-child.org/ Health-e-Child project] {{DEFAULTSORT:Glite-Amga}} [[Category:Middleware]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14565</id> <title>GNAT</title> <text>{{about|the compiler||Gnat (disambiguation)}} {{Refimprove|date=July 2010}} {{No footnotes|date=July 2010}} {{Infobox software | name = GNAT | screenshot = [[Image:Gps.png|300px]] | caption = Ada [[Source code|source]] within [[GNAT Programming Studio|GPS]] | developer = [[AdaCore]] and the [[GNU Project]] | latest release version = GNAT Pro 6.2 (2009-03-03) [http://www.adacore.com/2009/03/03/gnatpro62/] <br/>GNAT GPL 2008 (2008-06-11) <br/>GNAT GAP 2008 (2008-06-05) | operating system = [[Linux|GNU/Linux]],<br /> [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]/[[SPARC]], <br /> [[Microsoft Windows]], <br /> all others supported by GCC | genre = [[Compiler]] | license = [[GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]] (GNAT GPL & GNAT Pro Compiler) or [[GNAT Modified General Public License|MGPL]] (GNAT Pro Runtime) | website = [http://www.adacore.com/home/gnatpro/ GNAT Pro] <br/> [http://libre.adacore.com/ GNAT GPL] <br/> [http://www.adacore.com/home/academia/gap/ GNAT GAP] }} '''GNAT''' is a [[free software|free-software]] [[compiler]] for the [[Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language]] which forms part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. It supports all versions of the language, i.e. Ada 2005, Ada 95 and Ada 83; it allows already some constructs of Ada 2012 (i.e. pre/postconditions or conditional expressions). Originally its name was an [[acronym]] that stood for '''''G'''NU '''N'''YU '''A'''da '''T'''ranslator'', but that name no longer applies. The front-end and run-time are written in Ada. '''JGNAT''' is a GNAT version that compiles from the Ada programming language to [[Java bytecode]]. '''GNAT for dotNET''' is a GNAT version that compiles from the Ada programming language to [[Common Language Infrastructure]] for the .NET Framework and the free and open source implementations Mono and Portable.NET. == History == The project started in 1992 when the [[United States Air Force]] awarded [[New York University]] (NYU) a contract to build an open source compiler for Ada to help with the Ada 9X standardization process. The 3-million-dollar contract required the use of the [[GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]] for all development, and assigned the copyright to the [[Free Software Foundation]]. The first official validation of GNAT happened in 1995. In 1994 and 1996, the original authors of GNAT founded two sister companies, Ada Core Technologies in New York
