Cat3, Cat5e and Cat6 premises cable, varying grades of PVC are used, depending on flame safety rating requirements. This step starts off with molten plastic being extruded at high pressure and formed around the moving cable core. Shielding, ripcords, armoring and water blocking compound may also be applied at this step. Cables that require dual shielding or double armor will need to repeat this process. Once completed, the cable passed through a long cooling bath, then through a laser micrometer to verify the final diameter. ;Printing: Printing is done just before the cable is put in its final packaging. For OSP cable, a hot foil printing process is used, that leaves an indented print in the cable jacket. For premises cable, a high speed ink jet printer is used. Some cable manufacturers print distance marking from 1000–0 ft, or from 305–0 m making it very easy to determine how much cable is left in the box, or for measuring out cable runs. Other manufacturers use a six digit distance mark, making the process a little harder. ;Coiling: The completed cable is then wound onto a reel or coil. The coiling process requires very precise tension controls to ensure the cable won't tangle when being pulled out of its box. ;Final Testing: Once the cable is printed and coiled, it goes through one last set of tests. The manufacturer will test it against a large set of mechanical and electrical performance specifications. Once tested, the cable is ready for shipment. ==Advantages== *It is a thin, flexible cable that is easy to string between walls. *More lines can be run through the same wiring ducts. *UTP costs less per meter/foot than any other type of LAN cable. ==Disadvantages== *Twisted pair’s susceptibility to electromagnetic interference greatly depends on the pair twisting schemes (usually patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation. As a result, twisted pair cables usually have stringent requirements for maximum pulling tension as well as minimum bend radius. This relative fragility of twisted pair cables makes the installation practices an important part of ensuring the cable’s performance. *In video applications that send information across multiple parallel signal wires, twisted pair cabling can introduce signaling delays known as [[skew]] which results in subtle color defects and ghosting due to the image components not aligning correctly when recombined in the display device. The skew occurs because twisted pairs within the same cable often use a different number of twists per meter so as to prevent common-mode crosstalk between pairs with identical numbers of twists. The skew can be compensated by varying the length of pairs in the termination box, so as to introduce [[delay lines]] that take up the slack between shorter and longer pairs, though the precise lengths required are difficult to calculate and vary depending on the overall cable length. ==Minor twisted pair variants== * '''Loaded twisted pair''': A twisted pair that has intentionally added [[inductance]], common practice on telecommunication lines, except those carrying higher than [[voiceband]] frequencies. The added inductors are known as [[load coil]]s and reduce distortion. * '''Unloaded twisted pair''': A twisted pair that has no added load coils. * '''Bonded twisted pair''': A twisted pair variant in which the pairs are individually bonded to increase robustness of the cable. Pioneered by Belden, it means the electrical specifications of the cable are maintained despite rough handling. * '''Twisted ribbon cable''': A variant of standard [[ribbon cable]] in which adjacent pairs of conductors are bonded and twisted together. The twisted pairs are then lightly bonded to each other in a ribbon format. Periodically along the ribbon there are short sections with no twisting to enable connectors and [[Printed circuit board|pcb]] headers to be terminated using the usual ribbon cable [[Insulation-displacement connector|IDC]] techniques. ==See also== * [[Balanced line]] * [[Category 5 cable]] * [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] * [[Litz wire]] * [[Registered jack]] * [[TIA/EIA-568-B]] * [[Tip and ring]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Twisted-pair cables}} * [http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/sciencePhonesWork.shtml Telecommunications Virtual Museum] * [http://www.utp-vs-stp.com Independent comparative study UTP vs. STP for 10GBase-T] {{UTP Cable Standards}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Twisted Pair}} [[Category:Communication circuits]] [[Category:Video hardware]] [[Category:Electromagnetic compatibility]] [[af:Gedraaide draadpaar]] [[be-x-old:Вітая пара]] [[ca:Cable parell trenat]] [[cs:Kroucená dvojlinka]] [[da:Parsnoet kabel]] [[de:Twisted-Pair-Kabel]] [[es:Cable de par trenzado]] [[eu:Pare txirikordatu]] [[fa:زوج به‌هم‌تابیده]] [[fr:Paire torsadée]] [[ko:연선]] [[id:Twisted pair]] [[it:Unshielded Twisted Pair]] [[he:זוג שזור]] [[hu:UTP]] [[mk:Twisted pair]] [[ms:Pasangan berlingkar]] [[nl:Getwist paar]] [[ja:ツイストペアケーブル]] [[nn:Tvinna parkabel]] [[pl:Skrętka]] [[pt:Cabo de par trançado]] [[ro:Cablu Twisted Pair]] [[ru:Витая пара]] [[sk:Krútená dvojlinka]] [[sl:Parica]] [[fi:Parikaapeli]] [[sv:Partvinnad kabel]] [[tr:UTP kablo]] [[uk:Звита пара]] [[zh:双绞线]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38468</id> <title>Two-man rule</title> <text>{{Globalize/USA|date=May 2010|discuss=Talk:Two-man rule#Other countries}} The '''two-man rule''' is a control mechanism designed to achieve a high level of security for especially critical material or operations. Under this rule all access and actions requires the presence of two authorized people at all times. ==Nuclear weapons== Per US Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-104, "The Two Person Concept" is designed to prevent [[accident]]al or malicious [[rocket launch|launch]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s by a single individual. In the case of [[Minuteman missile]] launch crews, both operators must agree that the launch order is valid by comparing the authorization code in the launch order against the code from ''Sealed Authenticator'' (i.e. special sealed envelope which holds the code). These Sealed Authenticators are stored in a safe which has two separate [[lock]]s so a single crew member cannot open the safe alone. The crew members must at once turn the launch keys which are separated enough to prevent a single person from turning both keys simultaneously. For additional protection the missile crew in another [[Launch control center (ICBM)|Launch Control Center]] must do the same for the missiles to be launched. There is also a procedure for the "Single Survivor" situation where some other conditions must be fulfilled for a successful launch. On a [[submarine]], both the [[commanding officer]] and [[executive officer]] must agree that the order to launch is valid, and then mutually authorize the launch with their operations personnel. Instead of another party which would confirm a missile launch as in the case of land-based [[ICBM]]s
