He is a [[Microsoft Regional Director]], a [[Microsoft Most Valuable Professional|Microsoft MVP]], [[ASPInsider]], and an [[INETA]] speaker. He also writes for [[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN Online]]. Lhotka is the principal technology evangelist for [[Magenic]], a [[Microsoft Gold Certified Partner]]. A major contribution of Lhotka's is his [[Component-based Scalable Logical Architecture]] (CSLA) and its [[Microsoft .NET]] equivalent CSLA.NET. CSLA is an [[object-oriented]] [[software framework]] that provides a standard way to create robust object-oriented programs using so called [[Business object_(computer science)|business object]]. Though the framework is targeted toward Microsoft [[programming languages]], most of CSLA's concepts can be applied to other object-oriented programming languages. ==External links== *[http://www.dunntraining.com/ CSLA Training] *[http://www.lhotka.net/ http://www.lhotka.net/] *[http://www.magenic.com/ Magenic] *[http://forums.lhotka.net/ Csla forums] {{DEFAULTSORT:Lhotka, Rockford}} [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Technology writers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32366</id> <title>Rodin tool</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=January 2011}} The '''Rodin tool''', for formal modelling in Event-B. Event-B is a notation and method developed from the [[B-Method]] and is intended to be used with an incremental style of [[Modeling language|modelling]]. The idea of incremental modelling has been taken from programming: [[High-level programming language|modern programming languages]] come with [[integrated development environment]] that make it easy to modify and improve programs. The Rodin tool provides such an environment for Event-B. The two main characteristics of the Rodin tool are its ease of use and its extensibility. The tool focuses on modelling. It is easy to modify models and try out variations of a model. The tool can also be extended easily. This will make it possible to adapt the tool specific needs. So the tool can be adapted to fit into existing development processes instead demanding the opposite.

The case studies were lead by industrial partners of the Rodin project supported by the other partners. The case studies were as follows: *a failure management system for an engine controller *part of a platform for mobile Internet technology *engineering of communications protocols *an air-traffic display system *an ambient campus application ==Some Available Plug-ins for Rodin== *[http://www.b4free.com/index.html B4free provers] **Provider: ClearSy **Function: Theorem provers *[http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cfs/umlb.html UML-B] **Provider: University of Southampton **Function: UML-like graphical front-end for Event-B supporting class diagrams and state charts *[http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/ProB/overview.php proB] **Provider: University of D¨usseldorf **Function: Animation and Model-checking of Event-B models; Counterexamples for false proof goals, in particular, proof obligations *[http://www.brama.fr/index.html Brama] **Provider: ClearSy **Function: Animation of B models.

He is the founder of independent computer books publisher [[Sybex]] and was its president and CEO until it was bought out by [[John Wiley and Sons]] in May 2005. Zaks has an engineering degree from the renowned [[École Centrale Paris]] and a Master's degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he also was the third person to receive a Ph.D. from the then new [[Computer Science]] department. He started a career in training engineers and managers in the then new [[microprocessor]] technology and subsequently founded Sybex in 1976. Zaks has been a director of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s Special Interest Group on Microarchitecture (SIGMICRO) and founder of the non-profit organization [[EUROMICRO]]. An early publication of Zaks' from [[Sybex]] was ''A microprogrammed APL implementation''<ref>ISBN 0895880059</ref> which is the complete, total source listing for the microcode for a Digital Scientific Corporation Meta 4 microprogrammable processor implementing the [[APL (programming language)|APL]] programming language. ==Early Publications== * "Microprogrammed APL," R.Zaks, Fifth IEEE Computer Conference Proceedings, Sep. 1971 p 193 * "A Microprogrammed APL Implementation," R.
