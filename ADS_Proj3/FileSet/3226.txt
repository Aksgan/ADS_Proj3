5. During this time Novell also began to leverage its directory service, NDS, by tying their other products into the directory. Their [[e-mail]] system, [[Novell GroupWise|GroupWise]], was integrated with NDS, and Novell released many other directory-enabled products such as [[Novell ZENworks|ZENworks]] and [[Novell BorderManager|BorderManager]]. NetWare still required IPX/SPX as NCP used it, but Novell started to acknowledge the demand for TCP/IP with NetWare 4.11 by including tools and utilities that made it easier to create intranets and link networks to the Internet. Novell bundled tools, such as the IPX/IP gateway, to ease the connection between IPX workstations and IP networks. It also began integrating Internet technologies and support through features such as a natively hosted [[web server]]. === NetWare 5.x === With the release of NetWare 5 in October 1998, Novell finally acknowledged the prominence of the Internet by switching its primary NCP interface from the [[IPX/SPX]] network protocol to TCP/IP. IPX/SPX was still supported, but the emphasis shifted to TCP/IP. Novell also added a [[GUI]] to NetWare. Other new features were: * [[Novell Storage Services]] (NSS), a new file system to replace the traditional [[NetWare File System]] - which was still supported * [[Java virtual machine]] for NetWare * Novell Distributed Print Services (NDPS) * ConsoleOne, a new Java-based GUI administration console * directory-enabled [[Public key infrastructure]] services (PKIS) * directory-enabled [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] servers * support for [[Storage Area Network]]s (SANs) * Novell Cluster Services (NCS) * [[Oracle database|Oracle 8i]] with a 5-user license The Cluster Services greatly improved on SFT-III, as NCS does not require specialized hardware or identical server configurations. NetWare 5 was released during a time when NetWare [[market share]] dropped precipitously; many companies and organizations were replacing their NetWare servers with servers running [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows NT]] operating system. Novell also released their last upgrade to the NetWare 4 operating system, NetWare 4.2. Netware 5 and above supported Novell NetStorage for Internet-based access to files stored within Netware.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/nc2004_11f.html | title = More More More: Novell exteNd 5.2 and the Pursuit of SOA-Called Happiness | first = Linda | last = Kennard | authorlink = | date = 2004-12-09 | work = Novell Connection Magazine | publisher = Novell | accessdate = 2010-05-25 | quote = NetStorage ships with NetWare 6.5 and enables Internet-based access to files stored in users' iFolders and on servers running NetWare 5 and above. }} </ref><ref> {{cite book |first1= David |last1= Johnson |author1-link= |first2= James E. |last2= Gaskin |author2-link= |first3= Daniel |last3= Cheung |author3-link= |first4= Ed |last4= Tittel |author4-link= Ed Tittel |title= Novell Netware 5.X to 6 upgrade |url= http://books.google.com/books?lr=&id=LdZgPkOMP8kC |accessdate= 2010-05-25 |series= Exam cram 2 |year= 2003 |publisher= |location= Que Publishing |isbn= 9780789727886 |page= 177 |pages= 426 |quote= NetStorage is a bridge between a company's private, internal Novell network and the public Internet.

It introduced a number of useful tools, such as: * [[IBM WebSphere Application Server]] * NetWare Management Portal (later renamed Novell Remote Manager), web-based management of the operating system * [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]] and [[streaming media]] servers * NetWare Web Search Server * [[WebDAV]] support === NetWare 6.0 === NetWare 6 was released in October 2001. This version has a simplified licensing scheme based on users, not servers. This allows unlimited connections per user. Novell Cluster Services was also improved to support 32 node clusters. NetWare 6.0 included a 2 node clustering license. === NetWare 6.5 === NetWare 6.5 was released in August 2003. Some of the new features in this version included: * more open-source products such as [[PHP]], [[MySQL]] and [[OpenSSH]] * a port of the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] shell and a lot of traditional Unix utilities such as [[wget]], [[grep]], [[awk]] and [[sed]] to provide additional capabilities for scripting * [[iSCSI]] support (both target and initiator) * Virtual Office - an "out of the box" web portal for end users providing access to e-mail, personal file storage, company address book, etc. * [[Domain controller]] functionality * Universal password * DirXML Starter Pack - synchronization of user accounts with another eDirectory tree, a [[Windows Server domain|Windows NT domain]] or Active Directory. * exteNd Application Server - a [[Java EE]] 1.3-compatible [[application server]] * support for customized printer driver profiles and printer usage auditing * [[NX bit]] support * support for [[Universal serial bus|USB]] storage devices * support for encrypted volumes The latest - and apparently last - Service Pack for Netware 6.5 is SP8, released October 2008. === Open Enterprise Server === {{Main|Novell Open Enterprise Server}} ==== 1.0 ==== In 2003, Novell announced the successor product to NetWare: [[Open Enterprise Server]] (OES). First released in March 2005, OES completes the separation of the services traditionally associated with NetWare (such as Directory Services, and file-and-print) from the platform underlying the delivery of those services. OES is essentially a set of applications (eDirectory, [[NetWare Core Protocol]] services, iPrint, etc.) that can run atop either a [[Linux]] or a NetWare kernel platform. Clustered OES implementations can even migrate services from Linux to NetWare and back again, making Novell one of the very few vendors to offer a multi-platform clustering solution. Consequent to Novell's acquisitions of [[Ximian]] and [[SuSE]], a German Linux distributor, it is widely observed{{By whom|date=May 2010}} that Novell is moving away from NetWare and shifting its focus towards Linux. Much recent marketing seems to be focussed on getting faithful NetWare users to move to the Linux platform in future releases.<ref>{{cite news |first= Steven J. |last= Vaughan-Nichols |title= Novell Announces Linux-Based Open Enterprise Server 2 |url= http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2066147,00.asp |publisher= [[eWeek]] |date= 2006-11-30 |accessdate=2007-03-26 }}</ref> The clearest indication of this direction is Novell's controversial decision to release Open Enterprise Server in Linux form only. Novell later watered down this decision and stated that NetWare's 90
