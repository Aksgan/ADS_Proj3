chancery hand was at first a form of [[handwriting]] for business transactions that developed in the [[Apostolic Chancery|Lateran chancelry]] (the ''Cancelleria Apostolica'') of the thirteenth century, then spread to France, notably through the [[Avignon Papacy]], and to England after 1350 (Fisher et al.:3). This early "chancery hand" is a Gothic hand similar to [[blackletter]]. Versions of it were adopted by royal and ducal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]], which were often staffed by clerics who had taken minor orders. A later [[cursive]] "chancery hand", also developed in the Vatican, was introduced in the 1420s by [[Niccolò Niccoli]]; it was the manuscript origin of the typefaces we recognize as ''[[italic type|italic]]''. ==English chancery hand== In [[medieval England]] each of the royal departments tended to develop its own characteristic hand: the chancery hand used in the royal chancery at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] from the mid-century was employed for [[writ]]s, enrolments, patents and engrossing of royal letters; its use continued for the enrolment of acts of Parliament until 1836. The English chancery hand was already an arcane specialty by the time of the Restoration. [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded (Thursday 12 July 1660): {{quote|Up early and by coach to [[Whitehall|White Hall]] with Commissioner Pett, where, after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy Seal and got my bill perfected there, and at the Signet: and then to the [[House of Lords]], and met with Mr. Kipps, who directed me to Mr. Beale to get my patent engrossed; but he not having time to get it done in Chancery-hand, I was forced to run all up and down Chancery-lane, and the Six Clerks’ Office but could find none that could write the hand, that were at leisure.}} =="Italian hand"== The later ''cancelleresca corsiva'' ("cursive chancery hand") in which the pen was held slanted at a forty-five-degree angle for speed could also produce beautiful [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] work. It was adapted as the model for the [[italic type]]face developed by [[Aldus Manutius]] in [[Venice]], from punches cut by [[Francesco Griffo]] and first used in 1500 for the small portable series of inexpensive classics that issued from the Aldine press. In fifteenth-century [[Italy]] the chancery hand was employed in correspondence and everyday business, and for documents of minor formal importance. In sixteenth-century England, this became known as the "Italian hand" to distinguish it from the angular, cramped and gothic English chancery hand that had developed from the earlier tradition. Among the historical exponents of this chancery hand, the most famous is [[Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi|Ludovico degli Arrighi]], a scribe in the [[Papal Curia]]. He wrote a book on the principles of writing, ''L'Operina'' in 1522, that embodies the basic calligraphic principles of the italic calligraphic hand of today. ==See also== * [[Zapfino]], a digital typeface that simulates an italic chancery hand, designed by [[Hermann Zapf]]. ==References== *[http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/examples/chancery1.htm Medieval writing: 15th century English chancery hand] *[http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/examples/chancery2.htm Medieval writing: 16th century English chancery hand] *[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/palaeography/doc10/intro.htm (UK National Archives) Palaeography]: chancery hand *[http://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/pal-hist.htm Palaeography: historical notes] *Fisher, John, Malcolm Richardson, and Jane L.

It is a useful method of [[Leader election|election]] in decentralised [[distributed computing]]. == The algorithm == The algorithm assumes that each process has a Unique Identification (UID) and that the processes can arrange themselves in a [[unidirectional ring]] with a communication channel going to the clockwise and anticlockwise neighbour. The 2 part algorithm can be described as follows: # Initially each process in the ring is marked as ''non-participant''. # A process that notices a lack of leader starts an election. It marks itself as ''participant'' and creates an ''election message'' containing its UID. It then sends this message clockwise to its neighbour. # When a process receives an ''election message'' it compares the UID with its own, if the current process has a larger UID it replaces the one in the ''election message'' with its UID. The process then marks itself as ''participant'' and again forwards the ''election message'' in a clockwise direction. # If the process was already marked as ''participant'' when it receives an ''election message'' the procedure is different. In this case it will compare the UID as before but only forward the ''election message'' if it has needed to replace the UID. The algorithm finishes when a process receives an ''election message'' containing its own UID. Then the second stage of the algorithm takes place # This process marks itself as ''non-participant'' and sends an ''elected message'' to its neighbour announcing its election and UID. # When a process receives an ''elected message'' it marks itself as ''non-participant'' records the elected UID and again forwards the ''elected message''. # When the ''elected message'' reaches the newly elected process the election is over. Assuming there are no failures this algorithm will finish. == Properties == The algorithm respects [[safety (computer science)|safety]]: a process will receive an elected message with its own UID only if his UID is greater than others', and only when all processes agree on the same UID. The algorithm also respects [[liveness]]. "Participant" and "not participant" states are used so that when multiple processes start an election at roughly the same time, only a single winner will be announced. When there's a single process starting the election, the algorithm requires 3N-1 sequentially messages, in the worst case. Worst case is when the process starting the election is the immediate following to the one with greatest UID:
