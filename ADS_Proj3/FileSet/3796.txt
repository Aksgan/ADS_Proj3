'''Richard Manning Karp''' (born January 3, 1935) is a [[computer scientist]] and [[computational theorist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], notable for research in the [[theory of algorithms]], for which he received a [[Turing Award]] in 1985, [[The Franklin Institute Awards|The Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science in 2004]], and the [[Kyoto Prize]] in 2008.<ref>http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k24_a_richard/prs_e.html</ref> == Biography == Born to Abraham and Rose Karp in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Karp has three younger siblings: Robert, [[David A. Karp|David]], and Carolyn. He attended [[Harvard University]], where he received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1955, his [[Master's degree]] in 1956, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[applied mathematics]] in 1959. He started working at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]]. In 1968, he became Professor of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Operations Research at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Apart from a 4-year period as a professor at the [[University of Washington]], he has remained at Berkeley. From 1988 to 1995 and 1999 to the present he has also been a Research Scientist at the [[International Computer Science Institute]] in
