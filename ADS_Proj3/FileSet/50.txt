Not only did it considerably simplify the process of making an ANSI art screen from scratch, but it also included a variety of "fonts", large letters constructed from box and block characters, and transition animations such as ''dissolve'' and ''clock''. No new versions of TheDraw emerged after version 4.63 in 1993, but in later years a number of other ANSI editors appeared, some of which are still maintained today. The decline of both BBSes and DOS users has made it difficult for many users to even view ANSI animations. As a consequence, this form of art is no longer practiced to the degree it once was. [[File:Zzt.png|thumb|right|250px|Entry ANSI art screen for [[ZZT]] ]] The popular game creation system (GCS) ''[[ZZT]]'' used ANSI graphics exclusively. A later GCS based on the same concept, ''[[MegaZeux]]'', allowed users to modify the extended ASCII character set as well. [[Trade Wars 2002]], a multiplayer BBS game that remains popular 20 years after its release in 1986, used ANSI graphics to depict ships, planets, and important locations, and included cutscenes and even a cinema with ANSI animations. Many of these ANSI graphics were created by Drew Markham, who went on to form [[Xatrix]]/[[Gray Matter Interactive]] and develop ''[[Redneck Rampage]]'' and ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', among other titles. [[Dwarf Fortress]] is another game, first released in 2002, leveraging ANSI graphics. Dwarf Fortress' default graphics is exclusively ANSI [[code page 437]] characters. In [[1987]] [[Amiga]] program ''Skyline BBS'' was the first BBS management program featuring an extension to ANSI Art as a true form of script [[markup language]] communication protocol. It was called [[Skypix]] and was capable to give the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.<ref name=Skyline>{{cite web | title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher = [[Jason_Scott_Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine (?) | author = Scott Lee | accessdate = 2005}}</ref> ==See also== {{multicol}} * [[ANSI escape code]] * [[List of text editors#ASCII_and_ANSI_art]] {{col-break}} * [[TMDC]] * [[TheDraw]] {{col-end}} ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Bibliography== * Scott, Jason.

Nullsoft was the maker of the popular [[Winamp]] and [[SHOUTcast]] products. Both new organizations operated out of the same office in [[San Francisco]]. The Spinner.com brand was retired in July 2003, but exists today as an AOL Music blog and a series of channels on AOL Radio. AOL Radio launched as Radio@AOL, essentially a re-branded Spinner.com, using technology from [[Real Networks]] on October 16, 2001 as part of the AOL 7.0 software announced that same day.<ref>[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669020,00.html] AOL Radio Announcement</ref> In its first month of operation, AOL reported that 2.2 million members accessed Radio@AOL, making it one of AOL's most popular features.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669108,00.html AOL Radio Launch Announcement</ref> Initially, Radio@AOL was available only to AOL Members.

On August 22, 2002, AOL released Radio@Netscape Plus.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669435,00.html Radio@Netscape Plus announcement</ref> Beginning in 2004, AOL started metering Radio@Netscape to allow only two hours of usage per day. AOL did this to avoid paying copyright royalties and to encourage users to become AOL Members.<ref>http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=15639 AOL Metering Radio@Netscape article at The Inquirer</ref> On 28 November 2007, AOL announced that they may shut down their web radio services after a 38 percent increase in royalties to air music. Yahoo! and AOL discontinued directing users to their radio sites after [[SoundExchange]], the non-profit performance rights organization that collects royalties on the behalf of sound recording copyright owners (SRCOs) and featured artists for non-interactive digital transmissions, began collecting the higher fees in July.<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a0pKOrcpw6yE&refer=us Article concerning royalties issues</ref> On April 30, 2008, XM and AOL Radio ended their partnership due to the change in Internet royalty rates.<ref>http://journals.aol.com/theradioblog/aolradio/entries/2008/04/30/aol-radio--xm-update-430/1681 04-30-2008 AOL Radio announces
