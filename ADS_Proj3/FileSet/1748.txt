on '''[[iGO (software)|Nav N Go iGO 8]]''', covering several countries in Europe. It was developed by '''[[Nav N Go]]''' and utilizes maps by '''[[Tele Atlas]]'''. Sales of product started in March 2008. '''Go!Explore''' works with Sony's PSP-290 [[GPS]] receiver, which connects to the USB port on the top of the unit. It supports 11 audio languages on every geographic version; English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish. Currently there is no word on a United States version of Go!Explore. Explore currently only offers maps of UK/Ireland, Iberia, France, Germany/Austria/Switzerland, Italy, Benelux, and Scandinavia. Maps and points of interest are upgradeable via downloads, while new maps and guides can be purchased from the PlayStation Store for PC. Each map version supports audio in different languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish. '''No updates''' to the maps until first version, confirms two years later Sony will not update Go!Explore. Nothing can be done by the end-user to try insert updated maps from Atlas on it, making Go!Explore and PSP-290 not functional. Surprisingly, manufacturer doesn't inform anywhere it's a '''discontinued product'''.

The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white stones on the vacant intersections of a [[grid graph|grid]] of 19×19 lines. Once placed on the board, stones cannot be moved elsewhere, unless they are surrounded and captured by the opponent's stones. The object of the game is to secure (surround) a larger portion of the board than the opponent. When a game concludes, the controlled spaces are counted by their respective players to determine which portion is the largest, as territory size is not easily apparent during play. Placing stones close together helps them support each other and avoid capture; groups of stones must have two liberties (open points) to be "alive." On the other hand, placing stones far apart creates influence across more of the board. Part of the strategic difficulty of the game stems from finding a balance between such conflicting interests. Players strive to serve both defensive and offensive purposes and choose between tactical urgency and strategic plans. At its basis, the game is one of simple logic, while in advanced play the game involves complex heuristics and tactical analysis. Go originated in [[ancient China]] well before the 3rd century BC (exactly when is unknown), by which time it was already a popular pastime, as indicated by a reference to the game in the [[Analects of Confucius]]. Archaeological evidence shows that the early game was played on a board with a 17×17 grid, but by the time that the game spread to Korea and Japan in about the 7th century, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard. The game is most popular in East Asia. A conservative estimate places the number of Go players worldwide at approximately 27 million.<ref>[http://osdir.com/ml/games.devel.go/2003-01/msg00040.html Osdir.com]</ref> Go reached the West through Japan, which is why it is commonly known internationally by its Japanese name.<ref group="nb">The full Japanese name ''igo'' is derived from its Chinese name ''weiqi'', which roughly translates as "board game of surrounding", see [http://senseis.xmp.net/?EtymologyOfGo Etymology Of Go] at Sensei's Library for more information.
