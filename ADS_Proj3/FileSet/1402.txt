The primary advantage of XS-3 coding over BCD coding is that a decimal number can be [[Method of complements|nines' complement]]ed (for subtraction) as easily as a binary number can be [[ones' complement]]ed; just invert all bits. In addition, when the sum of two XS-3 digits is greater than 9, the carry bit of a four bit adder will be set high. This works because, when adding two numbers that are greater or equal to zero, an "excess" value of six results in the sum. Since a four bit integer can only hold values 0 to 15, an excess of six means that any sum over nine will overflow. Adding Excess-3 works on a different [[algorithm]] than BCD coding or regular binary numbers. When you add two XS-3 numbers together, the result is not an XS-3 number. For instance, when you add 1 and 0 in XS-3 the answer seems to be 4 instead of 1. In order to correct this problem, when you are finished adding each digit, you have to subtract 3 (binary 11) if the digit is less than decimal 10 and add three if the number is greater than or equal to decimal 10 (thus causing the number to [[Wrapping (overflow)|wrap]]). ==See also== *[[Gray code]] *[[Offset binary]] [[Category:Computer arithmetic]] [[Category:Numeration]] [[fr:Excess-3]] [[he:Excess-3]] [[ja:3増し符号]] [[fi:Excess-3]] [[ko:3 초과 부호]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12762</id> <title>Exchangeable image file format</title> <text>{{About|a format for storing metadata in image files|information about filename and directory structures of digital cameras|Design rule for Camera File system}} '''Exchangeable image file format''' ('''Exif''') is a specification for the [[image]] [[file format]] used by [[digital camera]]s and [[Image scanner|scanners]]. The specification uses the existing [[JPEG]], [[Tagged_Image_File_Format|TIFF]] Rev. 6.0, and [[Resource Interchange File Format|RIFF]] [[WAV]] file formats, with the addition of specific [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] tags. It is not supported in [[JPEG 2000]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], or [[GIF]]. == Background == Exif was created by the [[Japan Electronic Industries Development Association]] (JEIDA). Version 2.1 of the specification is dated June 12, 1998, and the latest, version 2.3 dated April 2010, was jointly formulated by [[Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association|JEITA]] and [[Camera & Imaging Products Association|CIPA]]. Though the specification is not currently maintained by any industry or [[standardization|standards]] organization, its use by camera manufacturers is nearly universal. The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum: * Date and time information. Digital cameras will record the current date and time and save this in the metadata. * Camera settings. This includes static information such as the camera model and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation (rotation), [[aperture]], [[shutter speed]], [[focal length]], [[metering mode]], and [[ISO speed]] information. * A [[thumbnail]] for previewing the picture on the camera's LCD screen, in file managers, or in photo manipulation software. * Descriptions and copyright information. == Technical == The Exif tag structure is borrowed from TIFF files. On several image specific properties, there is a large overlap between the tags defined in the [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], Exif, [[Tag Image File Format / Electronic Photography|TIFF/EP]], and [[Design rule for Camera File system|DCF]] standards. For descriptive metadata, there is an overlap between Exif and [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]] info, which also can be embedded in a JPEG file. When Exif is employed for [[JPEG]] files, the Exif data is stored in one of JPEG's defined utility ''Application Segments'', the APP1 (segment marker 0xFFE1), which in effect holds an entire TIFF file within. When Exif is employed in [[TIFF]] files (also when used as "an embedded TIFF file" mentioned earlier), the TIFF Private Tag 0x8769 defines a sub-Image File Directory (IFD) that holds the Exif specified TIFF Tags. In addition, Exif also defines a [[Global Positioning System]] sub-IFD using the TIFF Private Tag 0x8825, holding location information, and an "Interoperability IFD" specified within the Exif sub-IFD, using the Exif tag 0xA005. == Geolocation == {{See also|Geotagging}} The Exif format has standard tags for location information. Currently, a few cameras and some higher-end mobile phones have a built-in GPS receiver and store the location information in the Exif header when the picture is taken. Some other cameras have a separate GPS receiver that fits into the flash connector or [[hot shoe]]. Recorded GPS data can also be added to any digital photograph on a computer, either by correlating the time stamps of the photographs with a [[GPS tracking|GPS record]] from a hand-held GPS receiver or manually using a map or mapping software. The process of adding geographic information to a photograph is known as [[Geocoded photo|geocoding]]. Photo sharing communities like [[Panoramio]], [[locr]] or [[Flickr]] equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online. Most of [[Nokia]]'s Nseries mobile phones (such as the [[Nokia N95|N95]]) are equipped with a GPS receiver, and using Location Tagger<ref>{{cite web | url=http://betalabs.nokia.com/betas/view/location-tagger | title=Nokia Location Tagger for S60 | accessdate=2009-07-22 }}</ref>, a piece of software from [[Nokia Beta Labs]]. All captured images are tagged with corresponding GPS coordinates when a GPS signal is available. The second generation of [[iphone|iPhone]] (known as the iPhone 3G) by [[Apple Inc.]] is also equipped with a GPS receiver, and uses the receiver
