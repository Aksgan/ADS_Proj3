as early as 1976, the history of computing regards the earliest PC as one which contained a [[microprocessor]], which the 2200 PCS didn't. However, the self-contained PCS-II<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gaby.de/ewang.htm | title = 2200 PCS II | accessdate = Feb 24, 2009}}</ref> incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in PCs, including the first 5.25 inch floppy drives that were especially designed for the PCS-II by [[Shugart Associates]].<ref name = "Computer July 1977">{{Cite journal | last = Michalopoulos | first = Demetrios | title = New Products: Wang's new "deskette" computer brings direct-access processing to small user | journal = Computer | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | page = p. 81 | publisher = IEEE | date = July 1977 | doi = 10.1109/C-M.1977.217790 }} "The PCS II makes use of minidiskette storage devices initially conceived by Wang and developed by an independent disk manufacturer, Shugart Associates."</ref><!--"deskette" is a play on desktop computer with floppy disks.--> ===The Original Wang PC=== The original Wang PC was released to counter the IBM PC which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which Wang traditionally positioned the OIS system. It was based on the [[Intel 8086]] microprocessor, a slightly faster CPU than the IBM PC's 8088.<ref>The Intel 8088 processor is a slightly modified version of the earlier 8086. Its external data bus is 8 bits wide as compared to the 8086's 16, thus requiring two bus cycles to transfer a 16-bit value. This resulted in slower execution time for some instructions.</ref> A hardware/software package that permitted the Wang PC to act as a terminal to the OIS and VS products was available. The hardware component, the first version was made of two large add-in boards called the WLOC (Wang Local Office Connection), contained a Z-80 processor and 64k of memory. One of the distinguishing features of the Wang PC was the system software. Similar to the Wang VS minicomputer, the command line was not immediately evident. Everything could be run from menus, including formatting a disk. Furthermore, each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a dedicated [[Help key]] on the keyboard. This software was later sold in MS-DOS compatible form for non Wang hardware. The Wang word processing software was also very graphical. The keyboard had 16 function-keys and, unlike Wordstar, the popular word processor of the day, control key combinations were not required to navigate the system. The f-keys had the word processing functions labeled on them.<ref>This may be where the designers of [[WordPerfect]] got the idea of stickers with alt/ctrl/shift colors for the f-keys.</ref> However, the biggest stumbling block was that it was not [[PC compatible#Compatibility issues|compatible]] with the IBM PC. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM. Wang argued that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC display adapter, that were not compatible with their counterparts in the IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written specifically for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. A basic word processing package developed by Wang and Microsoft's Multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products. Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase II were also available. This dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original Wang PC, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286 based product that was fully plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost. Most Wang PCs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently, unlike IBM-compatible PCs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics. A color graphics adapter and Wang-branded color monitor were also available. An ergonomic feature of the WANG PC was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box. By using these, there was nothing on your desk except the keyboard. ===IBM Compatible Wang PCs=== {{Expand section|date=May 2008}} <!-- This is from memory - can anyone fill this out better? --> Wang later released an emulation board for Wang workstations that would allow the computer to boot into an IBM-PC compatible mode through a special program that would load the IBM operating system. The emulation board provided a virtual, [[monochrome]], text-only video card to IBM-compatible programs, allowing simple text applications to function as if they were running on a standard IBM-compatible PC. Further iterations of the PC line were released with the [[80286]]-chipset and had an IBM-compatible BIOS. The model number was PC-240. These later models booted directly into MS-DOS (or another compatible operating system) and supported [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]-standard expansion cards. This PC-240 still wasn't entirely IBM PC standard as the keyboard, although being a standard PC/AT device, allowed for VS compatibility with 24 function keys rather than the normal 12, and a number of Wang VS specific keys. There was also a slight difference in CPU interrupts from IBM standard, so some software had compatibility issues. VS connectivity was via an ISA based VS-terminal card, or via LightSpeed, the networked VS Terminal Emulator, over an [[IPX]]-based Ethernet connection. Originally the PC-240 came with a Wang specific [[Hercules Graphics Card]] and compatible screen, which also acted as a keyboard extension, meaning the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen. This was later replaced with an [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] card and screen. Around 1991, Wang released the PC350-16 and PC350-40, which were Intel [[80386]] based, clocked at 16 MHz and 40 MHz respectively. They used the same VS compatible
