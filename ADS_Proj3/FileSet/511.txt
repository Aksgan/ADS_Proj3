From 1976 to 1983 he was a lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering at the [[University of Salford]] in England and from 1983 at the department of mathematics. In 1988 he emigrated to Australia and became associate professor in the school of Information Systems at the [[University of New South Wales]]. In 1990, he founded the Object-Oriented Special Interest Group of the Australian Computer Society. He is co-founder and leader of the international OPEN Consortium.

It encapsulates business issues, quality issues, modelling issues and reuse issues within its end-to-end [[SDLC|lifecycle]] support for [[software development]] using the [[object-oriented]] paradigm. OPEN provides flexibility. Its metamodel-based framework can be tailored to individual domains or projects taking into account personal skills,
