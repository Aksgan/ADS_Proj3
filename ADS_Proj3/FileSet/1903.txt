</math>. This equation demonstrates Heckman's insight that sample selection can be viewed as a form of [[omitted-variables bias]], as conditional on both ''X'' and on <math>\lambda</math> it is as if the sample is randomly selected. The wage equation can be estimated by replacing <math>\gamma</math> with Probit estimates from the first stage, constructing the <math>\lambda</math> term, and including it as an additional explanatory variable in [[OLS|linear regression]] estimation of the wage equation. Since <math>\sigma_u > 0</math>, the coefficient on <math>\lambda</math> can only be zero if <math>\rho=0</math>, so testing the null that the coefficient on <math>\lambda</math> is zero is equivalent to testing for sample selectivity. Heckman's achievements have generated a large number of empirical applications in economics as well as in other social sciences. The original method has subsequently been generalized, by Heckman and by others.<ref>Lee, L.F. (2001) Self-selection. In B.

As operation outside the safe area of the chart can be [[death|fatal]] in the event of a power or transmission failure it is sometimes referred to as the '''dead man's curve''' or '''Coffin Corner''' by helicopter [[aviator|pilots]]. In the simplest explanation, the H/V curve is a [[diagram]] where the shaded areas should be avoided, as the average pilot may be unable to complete an [[Autorotation_(helicopter)|autorotation]] landing without damage. The H/V curve will usually contain a take-off profile, where the diagram can be traversed from 0 height and 0 speed to cruise, without entering the shaded areas or with minimum exposure to shaded areas. The portion in the upper left of this diagram demonstrates a flight profile which will likely not allow the pilot to successfully complete an autorotation, primarily due to having insufficient airspeed to enter an autorotative profile in time to avoid a crash. The shaded area on the lower right is dangerous due to the airspeed and proximity to the ground resulting in dramatically reduced [[reaction time]] for the pilot in the case of [[mechanical failure]], or other in-flight [[emergency|emergencies]]. This shaded area at the lower right is not portrayed in H/V curves for multiengine helicopters capable of safely hovering and flying with a single engine failure. The following examples further illustrate the relevance of the H/V curve to a single engine helicopter. At low [[height]]s with low [[airspeed]], such as a [[hover taxi]], the pilot can simply cushion the [[landing]] with collective, converting [[Angular momentum|rotational inertia]] to [[Lift (force)|lift]]. The [[aircraft]] is in a safe part of the H/V curve. At the extreme end of the scale (say a three-foot hover taxi at walking pace) even a complete failure to recognise the power loss resulting in an un-cushioned landing would probably be survivable. As the airspeed increases without an increase in height, there comes a point where the pilot's reaction time would be insufficient to react with a [[flare_(aviation)|flare]] in time to prevent a high-speed, and thus probably fatal, ground impact. Even small increases in height give the pilot much greater time to react, thus the bottom right part of the H/V curve is usually a shallow [[gradient]]. If above ideal autorotation speed, the pilot's instinct is usually to flare to convert speed to height and increase rotor RPM through [[coning]]; which also immediately gets them out of the dead man's curve. Conversely, an increase in height without a corresponding increase in airspeed will put the aircraft above a survivable un-cushioned impact height, and eventually above a height where
