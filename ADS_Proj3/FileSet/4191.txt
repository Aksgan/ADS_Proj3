approximate factorization of <math>p_j(x)\approx f_j(x)\,g_j(x)</math> is now to be lifted back to the original polynomial. To this end an alternation of Newton steps and [[Padé approximant|Pade approximation]]s is used. It is easy to check that :<math>\frac{p_{j-1}(x)}{g_j(x^2)}\approx \frac{f_{j-1}(x)}{g_{j-1}(-x)}</math> holds. The polynomials on the left side are known in step ''j'', the polynomials on the right side can bo obtained as [[Padé approximant]]s of the corresponding degrees for the power series expansion of the fraction on the left side. ==Finding a good circle== Making use of the Graeffe iteration and any known estimate for the absolute value of the largest root one can find estimates ''R'' of this absolute value of any precision. Now one computes estimates for the largest and smallest distances <math>R_j>r_j>0</math> of any root of ''p''(''x'') to any of the five center points 0, 2''R'', &minus;2''R'', 2''Ri'', &minus;2''Ri'' and selects the one with the largest ratio <math>R_j/r_j</math> between the two. By this construction it can be guaranteed that <math>R_j/r_j>e^{0{.}3}\approx 1.35</math> for at least one center. For such a center there has to be a root-free annulus of relative width <math>\textstyle e^{0{.}3/n}\approx 1+\frac{0{.}3}{n}</math>. After <math>\textstyle 3+\log_2(n)</math> Graeffe iterations, the corresponding annulus of the iterated polynomial has a relative width greater than 11 > 4, as required for the initial splitting described above (see Schönhage (1982)). After <math>\textstyle 4+\log_2(n)+\log_2(2+\log_2(n))</math> Graeffe iterations, the corresponding annulus has a relative width greater than <math>\textstyle 2^{13{.}8}\cdot n^{6{.}9}>(64\cdot n^3)^2</math>, allowing a much simplified initial splitting (see Malajovich/Zubelli (1997)) To locate the best root-free annulus one uses a consequence of the [[Rouché theorem]]: For ''k'' = 1, ..., ''n'' &minus; 1 the polynomial equation :<math>\,0=\sum_{j\ne k}|p_j|u^j-|p_k|u^k,</math> ''u'' > 0, has, by [[Descartes' rule of signs]] zero or two positive roots <math>u_k<v_k</math>. In the latter case, there are exactly ''k'' roots inside the (closed) disk <math>D(0,u_k)</math> and <math>A(0,u_k,v_k)</math> is a root-free (open) annulus. ==References== * Schönhage, Arnold (1982): [http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~schoe/fdthmrep.ps.gz ''The fundamental theorem of algebra in terms of computational complexity.''] Preliminary Report, Math.
