capable of accessing the memories of all their female ancestors, which gives them powerful advantages. They also run a secret multi-generational [[genetic engineering]] program to produce what they call the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], a male equivalent who can access both male and female past lives. They believe their control of this male will make them the most powerful faction in the universe. * [[StarCraft (series)#Novelizations|''StarCraft'' novel series]] ''StarCraft: The Dark Templar Saga'' by [[Christie Golden]], the Protoss retain a racial memory of the Xel'Naga abandoning them * [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' fantasy book series, wolves are sentient and innately retain the memories of their wolf ancestors. [[Mat Cauthon]], even before gaining memories by passing through the'' [[ter'angreal]] ''in [[Rhuidean]], retained memories of his Manetheren ancestors and was consequently able to sometimes speak the Old Tongue. * [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' deals with a tame dog rediscovering his wolf heritage. As this occurs, he vividly remembers one of his ancestors living alongside a cave man. Interestingly, at the time the book was written, very little was understood about genetics and the idea of genetic memory did not seem to have been introduced. London appears to have been ahead of his time. In a later story, 'Before Adam', a modern man dreams the life of a stone-age youth called Big-Tooth in exquisite detail, chronicling the fears and battles of life without language in the Mid-Pleistocene. He sums up " I, the modern, am incontestably a man; yet I, Big-Tooth, the primitive, am not a man. Somewhere, and by straight line of descent, these two parties to my dual personality were connected."ï¿½ * [[Larry Niven]]'s science fiction stories, there are frequent references to memories being stored in [[RNA]], and being transferable from one person to another. This plot element was based on actual research with [[flatworm#Biochemical memory experiments|flatworm]]s, which was later discredited. * [[Stel Pavlou]]'s novel ''[[Gene (novel)|Gene]]'' (2005) uses genetic memory as the central theme. The debate over [[nature versus nurture]] is embodied in the two central characters, whose revelations of past lives through genetic memory stretch back from the modern day to the [[Trojan War]]. * [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' book, ''[[Sourcery]]'', uses the idea of race memory when [[antihero]] [[Rincewind]] confronts the monsters of the [[Dungeon Dimensions]], where race memory (accessed by a sorcerer, Coin), tells him not to use magic against them as it only makes them stronger. * [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] explores the idea of a linguistic race memory in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]'' and ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'', and speculates about the real world in ''[[English and Welsh]]''. * The [[Superman]] villain [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] was cloned thousands of times by his father, Betron, who was trying to make him into the ultimate being. Every time the baby was killed by the vicious fauna on ancient [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], Betron harvested the remains to make the next clone more powerful. Doomsday possesses the genetic memories of all of his deaths, causing him to hate all life. * [[J. G. Ballard]]'s ''[[The Drowned World]]'' deals with a dystopian future in which some people, on the frontiers of earth's remaining inhabitable land, begin to devolve, psychologically, into a more primitive state of consciousness. * [[Mark Bailey (author)|Mark Bailey]]'s novel ''Saint'' deals with a successful project to use cloned recreated genetic material, from a man believed to have been the historical [[Saint Peter]], to transfer the personality of Saint Peter to a test subject. Memory is also transplanted from the scientist to a monkey. * [[Sheri S. Tepper]]'s ''The Maragarets'' explores the concept that the lack of a genetic/racial memory is what is fundamentally wrong with humans and that this genetic memory was stolen from humans by another species. ==Games== * ''[[Assassin's Creed (series)|Assassin's Creed]]'' video game series, main gameplay is about accessing the memories of an ancestor of the main character, Desmond Miles, and reading his genetic memory in a machine called the "Animus" * ''[[Psychonauts]]'' video game, Fred Bonaparte, head orderly turned inmate of Thorney Towers, is haunted by a genetic memory of his ancestor, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who won't leave until Fred finally beats him at a game of Waterloo * ''[[Star Control]]'' series of games, a race called the Mycon can pass on memories to their offspring, thus achieving a state which they term "shared immortality". * ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' universe, genetic memory is present within [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]], such as the [[Blood Angels]] who remember the death of their founder, with whom they share genetic material. One of the Marines' super-human abilities is to consume genetic material of living things to absorb their memories via the victims' [[DNA]]. {{DEFAULTSORT:Genetic Memory In Fiction}} [[Category:Science fiction themes]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15044</id> <title>Genetics Society of America</title> <text>The '''Genetics Society of America''' (GSA) is a scholarly membership society of more than 4000 [[genetics]] researchers and educators, established in 1931. The GSA is the publisher of the [[peer review|peer-edited]] [[scientific journal]] ''[[Genetics (journal)|GENETICS]]''. ==Mission== The mission of the Genetics Society of America is # to facilitate communication among geneticists, # to promote research that will bring new discoveries in genetics, # to foster the training of the next generation of geneticists so they can effectively respond to the opportunities provided by our discoveries and the challenges posed by them, and # to educate the public and their government representatives about advances in genetics and the consequences to individuals and to society. The Genetics Society of America endeavors to be the collective voice of its members on subjects where a deep knowledge of genetics and biological science is critically important. The Genetics Society of America seeks to foster a unified science of genetics and to maximize its intellectual and practical impact. ==Current programs== Current programs address these goals by promoting: ===Investigation of inheritance and heredity=== The GSA advocates funding of research in genetics, primarily through its membership in the Coalition for the Life Sciences (CLS), an organization of leading scientists that fosters public policies to advance
