On April 1, 2002, Veasey changed GameFAQs to "GameFAX" as an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamefaqs.com/|title=GameFAX|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://www.ksot.com/GameFAX.htm| archivedate=2002-04-01}}</ref> The site's colors were changed to green and black to imitate those of the [[Xbox]], with the intention of making users believe that GameFAQs was now dedicated solely to the Xbox, "the only system that matters." After clicking on any link on the main page, users were directed to the real GameFAQs home page. Nevertheless, Veasey reported receiving hate mail from users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=27283817|title= An important notice about the future of GameFAQs|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-04-01|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> ===CNET acquisition=== [[File:CNETNetworksSanFran.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A building with a glass and brick facade.

The amount paid for GameFAQs and two other unrelated websites was [[United States dollar|US$]]2.2 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccbn.10kwizard.com/xml/download.php?repo=tenk&ipage=2269604&format=PDF|title=CNET Networks SEC Quarterly Report|date=2003-08-05|format=PDF|publisher=CNET Networks|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> On June 3, 2003, Veasey announced the merger to the users of the site.<ref name="cnet"/> He clarified that the user-submitted content (i.e. FAQs, reviews) remained under the ownership of the authors and was not (nor could be) sold to CNET; however, CNET acquired GameFAQs' rights to host them on the site. He assured users that GameFAQs would undergo no major administrative change and said, "The GameFAQs you see today is the one you'll see tomorrow."<ref name="cnet"/> This was true to a certain extent, as the only visible change over the next few months was the addition of a CNET [[page footer|footer]] to the bottom of every page. Additional changes included moving the site to [[server (computing)|servers]] in [[California]]. From 2004 to 2006, GameFAQs witnessed further changes. On April 28, GameFAQs implemented a large visual redesign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chris.insder.com/newlayout/|title=New Layout/Boards Merger|publisher=GameFAQs Archive|accessdate=2006-09-20| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041009125141/http://chris.insder.com/newlayout/| archivedate=2004-10-09}}</ref> and the boards merged with the GameSpot boards to allow both communities to share the same game-specific boards (to the dismay of many GameFAQs users). To facilitate this, GameFAQs converted its board code from [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] to [[PHP]], and GameSpot dropped its [[Lithium Technologies|Lithium]] code. On April 11, 2006, a new design was implemented and the GameSpot [[logo]] was added to the GameFAQs logo on the header of every page. This change was initially greeted with general disapproval by users on the message boards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=27814467|title=Survey says...|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-04-28|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> To satisfy those who prefer the earlier layout, the old board pages have been preserved for certain users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=29712507|title=The v9 End of Life project|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-08-03|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> Shortly after the redesign, the site began using the [[Smarty]] [[template engine (web)|template engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=29230067|title=The first major code change is live...

Certain popular games may have additional boards for social discussion. Game-specific boards for certain older consoles do not have topicality rules and are often claimed for social discussion—these are referred to as "secret" or "dead" boards. Every system also has a general board for discussing [[hardware]] and upcoming games.<ref name="boards">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/|title=GameFAQs - Message Boards|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> GameFAQs has boards made purely for the purpose of socializing, some that cater to special interests (such as [[Anime]], [[TV]], [[Music]], and [[Wrestling]]), and some purely for users from a particular region (e.g. [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]]/[[New Zealand]]). GameFAQs also has boards for official announcements, contributor discussion, contest discussion, suggestions, and site help.<ref name="boards"/> ===Features=== Posts made on the message boards are mostly [[plain text]].

[[avatar (computing)|Avatars]] are not used, [[signature block|signatures]] are limited to two lines of text (160 characters total), and posts cannot be edited. Additionally, the forums use a [[wordfilter]] to prevent the use of certain vulgar words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/tou.html|title=Message Board Terms of Use|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> On some boards, topics are removed permanently after a having no new posts for a period of time.
