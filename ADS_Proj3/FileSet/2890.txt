0 such that :<math>d_1(x,y)<\delta \implies d_2(f(x),f(y))< \varepsilon \quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.</math> Every uniformly continuous map ''ƒ'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub> is continuous. The converse is true if ''M''<sub>1</sub> is compact ([[Heine–Cantor theorem]]). Uniformly continuous maps turn Cauchy sequences in ''M''<sub>1</sub> into Cauchy sequences in ''M''<sub>2</sub>. For continuous maps this is generally wrong; for example, a continuous map from the open interval (0,1) ''onto'' the real line turns some Cauchy sequences into unbounded sequences. ===Lipschitz-continuous maps and contractions=== Given a number ''K'' > 0, the map ''ƒ'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub> is [[Lipschitz continuity|''K''-Lipschitz continuous]] if :<math>d_2(f(x),f(y))\leq K d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.</math> Every Lipschitz-continuous map is uniformly continuous, but the converse is not true in general. If ''K'' < 1, then ''ƒ'' is called a [[contraction mapping|contraction]]. Suppose ''M''<sub>2</sub> = ''M''<sub>1</sub> and ''M''<sub>1</sub> is complete. If ''ƒ'' is a contraction, then ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point ([[Banach fixed point theorem]]). If ''M''<sub>1</sub> is compact, the condition can be weakened a bit: ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point if :<math>d(f(x), f(y)) < d(x, y)</math> for all <math>x \ne y \in M_1</math>. ===Isometries=== The map ''f'':''M''<sub>1</sub>→''M''<sub>2</sub> is an [[isometry]] if :<math>d_2(f(x),f(y))=d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1</math> Isometries are always [[injective]]; the image of a compact or complete set under an isometry is compact or complete, respectively. However, if the isometry is not [[surjective]], then the image of a closed (or open) set need not be closed (or open). ===Quasi-isometries=== The map ''f'':''M''<sub>1</sub>→''M''<sub>2</sub> is a [[quasi-isometry]] if there exist constants ''A''≥1 and ''B''≥0 such that :<math>\frac{1}{A} d_2(f(x),f(y))-B\leq d_1(x,y)\leq A d_2(f(x),f(y))+B\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1</math> and a constant ''C''≥0 such that every point in ''M''<sub>2</sub> has a distance at most ''C'' from some point in the image ''f''(''M''<sub>1</sub>). Note that a quasi-isometry is not required to be continuous. Quasi-isometries compare the "large-scale structure" of metric spaces; they find use in [[geometric group theory]] in relation to the [[word metric]]. ==Notions of metric space equivalence== Given two metric spaces (''M''<sub>1</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>) and (''M''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>2</sub>): *They are called '''homeomorphic''' (topologically isomorphic) if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] continuous in both directions). *They are called '''uniformic''' (uniformly isomorphic) if there exists a [[uniform isomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] uniformly continuous in both directions). *They are called '''isometric''' if there exists a [[bijective]] isometry between them. In this case, the two metric spaces are essentially identical. *They are called '''quasi-isometric''' if there exists a quasi-isometry between them. ==Topological properties== Metric spaces are [[paracompact]]<ref>Rudin, Mary Ellen. [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9939%28196902%2920%3A2%3C603%3AANPTMS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-W A new proof that metric spaces are paracompact]. Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 20, No. 2. (Feb., 1969), p. 603.</ref> [[Hausdorff space]]s<ref>{{planetmath reference|id=5838|title=metric spaces are Hausdorff}}</ref> and hence [[normal space|normal]] (indeed they are perfectly normal). An important consequence is that every metric space admits [[partitions of unity]] and that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subset of a metric space can be extended to a continuous map on the whole space ([[Tietze extension theorem]]). It is also true that every real-valued [[Lipschitz maps|Lipschitz-continuous]] map defined on a subset of a metric space can be extended to a Lipschitz-continuous map on the whole space. Metric spaces are [[first countable]] since one can use balls with rational radius as a neighborhood base. The metric topology on a metric space ''M'' is the coarsest topology on ''M'' relative to which the metric ''d'' is a continuous map from the product of ''M'' with itself to the non-negative real numbers. ==Distance between points and sets; Hausdorff distance and Gromov metric== A simple way to construct a function separating a point from a closed set (as required for a [[completely regular]] space) is to consider the {{ml|Distance|Distances_between_sets_and_between_a_point_and_a_set|distance between the point and the set}}. If (''M'',''d'') is a metric space, ''S'' is a [[subset]] of ''M'' and ''x'' is a point of ''M'', we define the distance from ''x'' to ''S'' as :''d''(''x'',''S'') = [[infimum|inf]] {''d''(''x'',''s'') : ''s'' ∈ ''S''} Then ''d''(''x'', ''S'') = 0 if and only if ''x'' belongs to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Furthermore, we have the following generalization of the triangle inequality: :''d''(''x'',''S'') ≤ ''d''(''x'',''y'') + ''d''(''y'',''S'') which in particular shows that the map <math>x\mapsto d(x,S)</math> is continuous. Given two subsets ''S'' and ''T'' of ''M'', we define their [[Hausdorff distance]] to be :''d''<sub>H</sub>(''S'',''T'') = max { [[supremum|sup]] {''d''(''s'',''T'') : ''s'' ∈ ''S''}, sup {''d''(''t'',''S'') : ''t'' ∈ ''T''} } In general, the Hausdorff distance ''d''<sub>H</sub>(''S'',''T'') can be infinite. Two sets are close to each other in the Hausdorff distance if every element of either set is close to some element of the other set. The Hausdorff distance ''d''<sub>H</sub> turns the set ''K''(''M'') of all non-empty compact subsets of ''M'' into a metric space. One can show that ''K''(''M'') is complete if ''M'' is complete. (A different notion of convergence of compact subsets is given by the [[Kuratowski convergence]].) One can then define the [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff distance]] between any two metric spaces by considering the minimal Hausdorff distance of isometrically embedded versions of the two spaces. Using this distance, the set of all (isometry classes of) compact metric spaces becomes a metric space in its own right. ==Product metric spaces== If <math>(M_1,d_1),\ldots,(M_n,d_n)</math> are metric spaces, and ''N'' is the Euclidean norm on ''R<sup>n</sup>'', then <math>\Big(M_1\times \ldots \times M_n, N(d_1,\ldots,d_n)\Big)</math> is a metric space, where the '''product metric''' is defined by :<math>N(d_1,...,d_n)\Big((x_1,\ldots,x_n),(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\Big) = N\Big(d_1(x_1,y_1),\ldots,d_n(x_n,y_n)\Big)</math> , and the induced topology agrees with the [[product topology]]. By the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions, an equivalent metric is obtained if ''N'' is the [[Norm_(mathematics)#Taxicab_norm_or_Manhattan_norm|taxicab norm]], a [[Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]], the [[Norm_(mathematics)#Infinity_norm_or_maximum_norm|max norm]], or any other norm which is non-decreasing as the coordinates of a positive ''n''-tuple increase (yielding the triangle inequality). Similarly, a countable product of metric spaces can be obtained using the following metric :<math>d(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac1{2^i}\frac{d_i(x_i,y_i)}{1+d_i(x_i,y_i)}</math>. An uncountable product of metric spaces need not be metrizable. For example, <math>\mathbf{R}^\mathbf{R}</math> is not [[first-countable space|first-countable]] and thus isn't metrizable. ===Continuity of distance=== It is worth noting that in the case of a single space <math>(M,d)</math>, the distance map <math>d:M\times M \rightarrow R^+</math> (from
