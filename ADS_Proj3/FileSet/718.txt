story, a machine is designed, the sole purpose of which is to find metal to produce copies of itself, intended to be used as a weapon against an enemy's war machines. The machines are released on a deserted island, the idea being that once the available metal is all used and they start fighting each other, [[natural selection]] will enhance their design. However, the evolution has stopped by itself when the last descendant, an enormously large crab, was created, being unable to reproduce itself due to lack of energy and materials. [[Stanisław Lem]] has also studied the same idea in his novel ''[[The Invincible]]'' (1964), in which the crew of a spacecraft landing on a distant planet finds non-biological life-form, which is the product of long, possibly of millions of years of mechanical evolution. This phenomenon is also key to the aforementioned Anderson story. [[John Sladek]] used the concept to humorous ends in his first novel ''The Reproductive System'' (1968, also titled ''Mechasm'' in some markets), where a U.S. military research project goes out of control. NASA's Advanced Automation for Space Missions study directly inspired the science fiction novel ''[[Code of the Lifemaker]]'' (1983) by author [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]. The movie ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]'', based on Dick's short story ''Second Variety'', features a group of robot weapons created by mankind to act as Von Neumann devices / berserkers. The original robots are subterranean buzzsaws that make a screaming sound as they approach a potential victim beneath the soil. These machines are self-replicating and, as is found out through the course of the movie, they are quite intelligent and have managed to "evolve" into newer, more dangerous forms, most notably human forms which the real humans in the movie cannot tell apart from other real humans except by trial and error. ===Other notable fiction literature containing clanking replicators=== *"[[Autofac]]" by [[Philip K.

However, such factories are unlikely to achieve "full closure" until the cost and flexibility of automated machinery comes close to that of human labour and the manufacture of spare parts and other components locally becomes more economical than transporting them from elsewhere. Fully-capable machine replicators are most useful for developing resources in dangerous environments which are not easily reached by existing transportation systems (such as [[outer space]]). A clanking replicator can be considered to be a form of [[artificial life]]. Depending on its design, it might be subject to evolution over long time periods. However, with robust [[error correction]], and the possibility of external intervention, the common [[science fiction]] theme of robotic life run amok is unlikely in the near term. ==Etymology== It should probably be noted that ''clanking'' is an example of [[onomatopoeia]], understandable to some English speakers, but not to all. The term is meant to evoke the image of a nineteenth century factory, powered by [[steam]], pushing [[gear]]s and rods, noisy and clamorous. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Robots]] [[Category:Artificial life]] [[Category:Robotics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6368</id> <title>Claris Resolve</title> <text><!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ClarisResolveScreenshot.png|thumb|right|Claris Resolve in black and white|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 22 April 2008}}]] --> <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ClarisResolveScreenshot2.png|thumb|right|Claris Resolve in color]] --> <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Claris Resolve.png|Claris Resolve icon]] -->'''Claris Resolve''' was a [[spreadsheet]] [[software program]] for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. It was released by [[Claris]] in 1991 and sold until 1994. In an effort to flesh out their software suite, in the early 90's Claris wanted to introduce a spreadsheet application, and decided to buy an existing one. This was not particularly difficult, as [[Informix]] had essentially abandoned the Mac version of [[Informix WingZ|WingZ]], and Claris was able to purchase the non-exclusive rights to the [[source code|codebase]]. After changing the interface to conform to their new "Pro" line of product's [[GUI]], they released it at the [[MacWorld Expo|MacWorld Expo Boston]] on June 6, 1991 as Resolve. Resolve supports a worksheet size of more than one billion cells and includes 149 built-in functions that allow users to create financial, statistical and mathematical models. Resolve also contains [[object-oriented]], [[MacDraw]]-like drawing tools for combining illustrations, clip art, text, charts and numbers in reports. Resolve failed to gain significant market share due to [[Microsoft Excel]], which also stopped [[Lotus 1-2-3]] becoming popular on the Macintosh. This led to disappointing sales, and in [[1993]] development was stopped. On 31 March 1994 Claris stopped selling Resolve, the program was supported up until 31 March 1995. Claris suggested existing Resolve users to upgrade to the spreadsheet module of [[ClarisWorks]]. == External links == * [http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-076.html TidBITS#76/12-Aug-91 Claris Resolve introduction information] * [http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-216.html TidBITS#216/07-Mar-94 Claris Resolve discontinuation info] * [http://www.knubbelmac.de/software/tabellenkalkulation.html#resolve Claris Resolve Information and Screenshots on knubbelmac.de] [[Category:Mac OS-only software]] [[Category:Spreadsheet software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6370</id> <title>Clarksfield (microprocessor)</title> <text>{{Compu-hardware-stub}} {{Infobox CPU | name = Clarksfield | image = | image_size = | caption = | produced-start = 2009 | produced-end = present | slowest = 1.60 | fastest = 2.00 (turbo up to 3.2) | fsb-slowest = | fsb-fastest = | fsb-slow-unit = | fsb-fast-unit = | size-from = [[45 nm]] | size-to = | soldby = | designfirm = [[Intel]] | core1 = | sock1 = [[µPGA-988]] | pack1 = | brand1 = [[Intel Core i7|Core i7]]-7xxQM | brand2 = [[Intel Core i7|Core i7]]-8xxQM | brand3 = [[Intel Core
