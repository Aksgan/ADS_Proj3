However, two years later in 1914, due to the growing anti-German sentiments that swept across Europe during the first few months of World War I and a series of lost battles at sea, Prince Louis felt it was his duty to step down from the position.<ref>Lord Zuckerman,''Earl Mountbatten of Burma, K.G., O.M. 25 June 1900-27 August 1979,'' in Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, Vol. 27 (Nov., 1981), pp 355-364. Accessed 13 May 2009 at www.jstor.org/stable/769876</ref> In 1917, when the Royal Family stopped using their German names and titles, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven|Prince Louis of Battenberg]] became Louis [[Mountbatten]], and was created [[Marquess of Milford Haven]]. His second son acquired the [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] ''Lord Louis Mountbatten'' and was known as ''Lord Louis'' informally until his death notwithstanding his being granted a viscountcy in recognition of his wartime service in the Far East and an earldom for his role in the transition of India from British dependency to sovereign state. ==Early life== Mountbatten was home schooled for the first ten years of his life. He was then sent to [[Lockers Park School]] in [[Hertfordshire]] and finally he followed his older brother to the Naval Cadet School. In childhood he visited the Imperial Court of Russia at [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]] and became intimate with the doomed [[House of Romanov|Russian Imperial Family]]; in later life he was called upon authoritatively to rebut claims by pretenders to be the supposedly surviving [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]]. As a young man he had romantic feelings towards Anastasia's sister, the [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899–1918)|Grand Duchess Maria]], and until the end of his life he kept her photograph at his bedside. After his nephew's change of name and engagement to the future Queen, he is alleged to have referred to the United Kingdom's dynasty as the future "House of Mountbatten", whereupon the Dowager [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] reportedly refused to have anything to do with "that Battenberg nonsense", and the name of the Royal house remains [[House of Windsor|Windsor]] by subsequent Royal decree — this can, however, be changed on the Monarch's wishes. After the marriage of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], it was decreed that their non-royal descendants were to bear the (maiden) surname "Mountbatten-Windsor". Less than a week after the King's funeral, the new Queen's Uncle Dickie announced to guests at Broadlands that "The House of Mountbatten now reigns!" <ref>War of the Windsors,2002</ref> ==Career== ===Early career=== Lord Mountbatten served in the [[Royal Navy]] as a midshipman during [[World War I]]. After his service, he attended [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] for two terms where he studied engineering in a program that was specially designed for ex-servicemen. During his time at Cambridge, Mountbatten had to balance his studies with the robust social life he enjoyed as a member of Christ's College. In 1922, Mountbatten accompanied Edward, Prince of Wales, on a royal tour of India. It was during this trip that he met and proposed to his wife-to-be Edwina Ashley. They wed on 18 July 1922. Edward and Mountbatten formed a close friendship during the trip but their bond deteriorated during the [[Abdication Crisis]]. Mountbatten's loyalties between the wider Royal Family and the throne, on the one hand, and the then-King, on the other, were tested. Mountbatten came down firmly on the side of Prince Albert, the Duke of York, who was to assume the throne as [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in his brother's place. Pursuing his interests in technological development and gadgetry, Mountbatten joined the Portsmouth Signal School in 1924 and then went on to briefly study electronics at [[Greenwich]] before returning to military service. Mountbatten was a Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers ([[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]]), and the successor organisation, the Institution of Engineering and Technology ([[Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology|IET]]), annually awards the Mountbatten Medal for an outstanding contribution, or contributions over a period, to the promotion of electronics or information technology and their application.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/institution-history/mountbatten-medal.cfm| title = Mountbatten Medal | accessdate = 2009-12-24| publisher = IET}}</ref> In 1926, Mountbatten was appointed to Assistant Fleet Wireless and Signals Officer of the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. Lord Mountbatten returned to the Signal School in 1929 as Senior Wireless Instructor. In 1931, he was again called back to military service when he was appointed Fleet Wireless Officer to the Mediterranean Fleet. It was during this time that he founded a Signal School in Malta and became acquainted with all the radio operators in the fleet. In 1934, Mountbatten was appointed to his first command. His ship was a new destroyer which he was to sail to Singapore and exchange for an older ship. He successfully brought the older ship back to port in Malta. By 1936, Mountbatten had been appointed to the Admiralty at Whitehall as a member of the Fleet Air Arm.<ref name="ReferenceA">Zuckerman,''Earl Mountbatten of Burma, K.G., O.M. 25 June 1900-27 August 1979</ref> ====Patent==== In the late 1930s Mountbatten was issued his 2nd Patent (UK Number 508,956) for a system for maintaining a warship in a fixed position relative to another ship.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.wikipatents.com/gb/508956.html| title = Abstract of GB508956 508,956.
