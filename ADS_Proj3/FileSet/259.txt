was primarily aimed at producing multimedia presentations for distribution on [[CD-ROM]] and was aimed at graphic designers who did not have programming experience. It featured an advanced user interface with an object-oriented user model that made production of rich and complex presentations easy. == History == The AMT system was developed by [[Patrick Soquet]], a developer in [[Belgium]] working for [[Arborescence]] a French company that was later acquired by [[Euro RSCG|Havas]]. From 1993 onwards it was marketed by Apple but all development was done by the independent team led by M. Soquet. In 1996 development of the tool was taken over by Apple and the 2.1 version of the program was developed in house by a team of engineers in [[California]] led by [[Dan Crow (computer scientist)|Dan Crow]]. In 1997 Apple decided to concentrate its multimedia offerings on [[QuickTime]] and [[HyperCard]] and the rights to AMT returned to Havas. Patrick Soquet acquired these rights and co-founded [[Tribeworks iShell|Tribeworks]] and developed a new tool based on AML, called [[iShell]]. == Features == The major features of the Apple Media Tool were a graphical authoring tool (AMT itself) and an associated programming environment - the '''Apple Media Tool Programming Environment''' (AMTPE) which was a compiler and debugger for the underlying '''Apple Media Language''' (AML - also known as the '''Key''' language). AMT was notable as one of the first authoring systems to support embedding Apple's pioneering [[QTVR]] movie format. AML is an [[object-oriented]] [[programming language]] based on [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] but specialized for multimedia programming. Although the AMT did not require any programming experience to use, it produced complete AML programs which were then compiled into [[byte code]] and interpreted by a runtime interpreter. The AMPTE could be used to enhance the AML code to create more complex programs, for example accessing a database to retrieve media. AML is conceptually similar to Java, with a "write once, run anywhere" approach to cross-platform development: it had runtime interpreters for both the [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms. == Awards == * 1993 [[MacUser]] Editor's Choice Award for Best New Multimedia Software == External links == *[http://www.mug.jhmi.edu/mirrors/InfoAlley/0196/29/media.html Apple Media Tool 2.0 ReadMe file] {{Apple software}} [[Category:Domain-specific programming languages]] [[Category:Hypertext]] [[Category:Multimedia software]] [[Category:Apple Inc. software|Media Tool]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2165</id> <title>Apple Writer</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Apple Writer | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | collapsible = | author = [[Paul Lutus]] | developer = [[Apple Computer]] | released = 1979 | latest release version = 2.1 | latest release date = 1985 | programming language = | operating system = [[Apple DOS]], [[Apple ProDOS]] | platform = [[Apple II series|Apple II]] | status = [[Freeware]] (1992) | genre = [[Word processor]] }} '''''Apple Writer''''' is a [[word processor]] for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] family of personal computers.

It displayed text entirely in uppercase, but case could be toggled by pressing the ESC key; characters that the user signified as uppercase appeared in inverse (black on white) capitals, while characters in lowercase appeared as standard capitals. The names of the binary files ''Apple Writer 1.0'' produced began with the prefix "TEXT". ===''Apple Writer 1.1''=== Released in 1980, ''Apple Writer 1.1'' took advantage of DOS 3.3 and ran under the newer 16-sector format. It also featured a spellchecker known as Goodspell and some minor bug fixes. ===''Apple Writer II''=== ''Apple Writer II'' was released in 1981 and like its predecessor ran under DOS 3.3 on an [[Apple II Plus]]. Unlike the original, ''Apple Writer II'' could display both upper and lower case characters and, with a Sup-R-Term card in slot 3, could support both 40- and 80-column text. It also wrapped text too long to appear on the current line (rather than breaking it mid-word) and included a glossary and the Word Processing Language (WPL), a macro-like resources that allowed certain tasks to be automated. ''Apple Writer II'' files saved as standard text files rather than the older binary files. ===''Apple Writer IIe''=== Released in 1983, ''Apple Writer IIe'' took advantage of the [[Apple IIe]]'s built-in 80-column display and full keyboard and featured the ability to create larger files, print files to disk and directly connect the computer keyboard to a printer for typewriter-like operation. ===''Apple Writer 2.0''=== ''Apple Writer 2.0'' was released in September 1984 and was the first version of the series to run under [[ProDOS]]. It allowed users to set screen margins and to connect the computer's keyboard to a modem, allowing it to be used as a rudimentary terminal program. ===''Apple Writer 2.1''=== Published in late 1985, this version corrected a problem with parallel printer cards present in 2.0 and changed printed characters from low-ASCII to high-ASCII, correcting an issue with certain interface cards and printers. ===Freeware=== Following the success of ''[[AppleWorks]]'', Apple discontinued the ''AppleWriter'' series. Creator Paul Lutus agreed in 1992 to make his program available on a [[freeware]] basis: it could be copied freely and given away, but could not be sold for a profit. ==References== <references /> ==External links== *[http://apple2history.org/history/ah18.html#AppleWriter Apple II History, Chapter 18: Apple Writer] [[Category:Apple II software]] [[Category:Word processors]] [[Category:Apple II word processor]] [[Category:1979 software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2169</id> <title>Applegeeks</title> <text>{{Original research|date=June 2009}} {{Infobox comic strip <!-- Part of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics]] --> |title= Applegeeks |image=[[File:Apple Geeks Title.gif|200px]] |caption= ''Applegeeks'' Issue 161 |author= [[Mohammad "Hawk" Haque]]<br />[[Ananth Panagariya]] |url= http://www.applegeeks.com/ |rss= http://www.applegeeks.com/rss/ |atom= |status= Updates Mondays and Thursdays |first= 2003<ref name="applegeeks1">{{cite web|work= Applegeeks|year= 2003| title= ''Applegeeks'' strip #1|url= http://www.applegeeks.com/index.php?comic=1 | accessdate= April 23, 2006 }}</ref><!-- Needs precise date comic was started--> |last=
