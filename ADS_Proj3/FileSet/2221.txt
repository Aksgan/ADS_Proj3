routing of Internet traffic. [[IPv6]] is currently in commercial [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] phase around the world and Internet address registries ([[Regional Internet registry|RIRs]]) have begun to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |title=Notice of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Address Depletion |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref> IPv6 is not interoperable with IPv4. It essentially establishes a "parallel" version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. This means software upgrades or translator facilities are necessary for every networking device that needs to communicate on the IPv6 Internet. Most modern computer operating systems are already converted to operate with both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructures, however, are still lagging in this development. Aside from the complex physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts (e.g., [[peering agreement]]s), and by technical specifications or [[communications protocol|protocol]]s that describe how to exchange [[data]] over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies. ===Structure=== The Internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied extensively. It has been determined that both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s. Similar to the way the commercial Internet providers connect via [[Internet exchange point]]s, research networks tend to interconnect into large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]] (successor of the [[Abilene Network]]), and the UK's [[national research and education network]] [[JANET]]. These in turn are built around smaller networks (see also the list of [[:Category:Academic computer network organizations|academic computer network organizations]]). Many computer scientists describe the Internet as a "prime example of a large-scale, highly engineered, yet highly complex system".<ref>Walter Willinger, Ramesh Govindan, Sugih Jamin, Vern Paxson, and Scott Shenker (2002). [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_1/2573 Scaling phenomena in the Internet], in ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99'', suppl. 1, 2573â€“2580</ref> The Internet is extremely heterogeneous; for instance, [[data transfer rate]]s and physical characteristics of connections vary widely. The Internet exhibits "[[Emergence|emergent phenomena]]" that depend on its large-scale organization. For example, data transfer rates exhibit temporal [[self-similarity]]. The principles of the routing and addressing methods for traffic in the Internet reach back to their origins the 1960s when the eventual scale and popularity of the network could not be anticipated. Thus, the possibility of developing alternative structures is investigated.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003667811_btrebuildnet16.html "Internet Makeover?

It operates without a central governing body. However, to maintain interoperability, all technical and policy aspects of the underlying core infrastructure and the principal [[name space]]s are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), headquartered in [[Marina del Rey, California]]. ICANN is the authority that coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces, in which names and numbers are uniquely assigned, are essential for the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. The government of the United States continues to have the primary role in approving changes to the [[DNS root zone]] that lies at the heart of the domain name system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body on the global Internet. On 16 November 2005, the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], held in [[Tunis]], established the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues. ==Modern uses== The Internet is allowing greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections and [[web application]]s. The Internet can now be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, especially through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet from anywhere there is a wireless network supporting that device's technology. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and wireless data transmission charges may be significantly higher than other access methods. Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from [[website]]s. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides, [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. In [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas, but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups to easily form in the first place. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other programs, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]]. Internet "chat", whether in the form of [[IRC]] chat rooms or channels, or via [[instant messaging]] systems, allow colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way when working at their computers during the day. Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via e-mail. Extensions to these systems may allow files to be exchanged, "whiteboard" drawings to be shared or voice and video contact between team members. [[Version control]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents without either accidentally overwriting each other's work or having
