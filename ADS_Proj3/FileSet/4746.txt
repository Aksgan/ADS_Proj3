These include software like Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash player, Microsoft Silverlight, ActiveX, Oracle Java, Quicktime, Windows Media, etc. ; Signals : The use of syndication technology such as [[RSS]] to notify users of content changes. While SLATES forms the basic framework of Enterprise 2.0, it does not contradict all of the higher level Web 2.0 design patterns and business models. In this way, a new Web 2.0 report from O'Reilly is quite effective and diligent in interweaving the story of Web 2.0 with the specific aspects of Enterprise 2.0. It includes discussions of self-service IT, the long tail of enterprise IT demand, and many other consequences of the Web 2.0 era in the enterprise. The report also makes many sensible recommendations around starting small with pilot projects and measuring results, among a fairly long list.<ref>[http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 Blogs.ZDnet.com]</ref> ==Usage== A third important part of Web 2.0 is the Social Web which is a fundamental shift in the way we communicate. The social web consists of a number of online tools and platforms where people share their perspectives, opinions, thoughts and experiences. Web 2.0 Applications tend to interact much more with the end user. As such, the end user is not only a user of the application but also a participant by: : [[Podcasting]] : [[Blogging]] : [[Tagging]] : [[Contributing to RSS]] : [[Social bookmarking]] : [[Social networking]] The popularity of the term Web 2.0, along with the increasing use of blogs, wikis, and social networking technologies, has led many in academia and business to coin a flurry of 2.0s,<ref>Schick, S., 2005.

For example, in the Talis white paper "Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation", Paul Miller argues <blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloguing efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10&ndash;11</ref></blockquote> Here, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a "Library 2.0". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of web 2.0 is role dependent, as Dennis D. McDonalds noted. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to "end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s]."<ref>http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411</ref> There is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education. Issues under consideration include the understanding of students' different learning modes; the conflicts between ideas entrenched in informal on-line communities and educational establishments' views on the production and authentication of 'formal' knowledge; and questions about privacy, plagiarism, shared authorship and the ownership of knowledge and information produced and/or published on line.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.9995&rep=rep1&type=pdf | title=What is Web 2.0?

A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, service enhancement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis -- Web sites that allow users to add, delete and edit content -- to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. Another marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122884677205091919.html | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | year=2008 | journal=The Wall Street Journal }}</ref> : Mainstream media usage of web 2.0 is increasing.
