risk from [[Legionellosis]] it is advised that hot water is heated to above 60°C. The overall lifetime costs for using air source heat pumps should be considered carefully as mains gas (where available) may be cheaper than electricity (although it has higher carbon emissions). Air source heat pumps should last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions by Danfoss Heat Pumps|url=http://www.ecoheatpumps.co.uk/heat_pump_faq.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How air source heat pumps work from HomeTips.com|url=http://www.hometips.com/heatpumps-airsource.html}}</ref> ==References== <references/> ==Literature== Summer, John A.

They offer no lateral stability. Tank lifters using airbags use multiple lifts and a large amount of blocking that is stacked as the tank is lifted in several incremental short lifts. == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Lifting equipment]] {{tech-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>1276</id> <title>Aircrack-ng</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = aircrack-ng | logo = [[Image:Aircrack-ng-new-logo.jpg]] | screenshot = [[Image:Airodump-ng 0-5.jpg|250px]] | caption = Airodump-ng 0.5 | developer = Thomas d'Otreppe | latest_release_version = 1.1 | | latest_release_date = {{release date|2010|04|24}} | latest_preview_version = 1.0-rc4 | latest_preview_date = {{release date|2009|07|27}} | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] | genre = [[Packet sniffer]] and [[Packet injection|injector]]; [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP encryption key recovery]] | license = [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] | website = [http://www.aircrack-ng.org/ www.aircrack-ng.org] }} '''Aircrack-ng''' is a network software suite consisting of a detector, [[packet sniffer]], [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]/[[WPA2-PSK]] [[Wireless cracking|cracker and analysis]] tool for [[802.11]] [[wireless LAN]]s. It works with any [[Wireless network interface card|wireless card]] whose driver supports [[Monitor mode|raw monitoring mode]] (for a list, visit the website of the project or [http://wiki.remote-exploit.org/index.php/HCL:Wireless]) and can sniff [[802.11a]], [[802.11b]] and [[802.11g]] traffic. The program runs under [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]; the Linux version has been ported to the [[Sharp Zaurus|Zaurus]] and [[Maemo (operating system)|Maemo]] platforms, and a [[proof-of-concept]] port has been made to the [[iPhone]]. In April 2007 a team at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] in [[Germany]] developed a new attack method based on a paper released on the RC4 cypher by [[Adi Shamir]]. This new attack, named 'PTW', decreases the number of [[initialization vector]]s or IVs needed to decrypt a WEP key and has been included in the aircrack-ng suite since the 0.9 release. Aircrack-ng is a fork of the original [[Aircrack]] project. == Features == The aircrack-ng software suite includes: {| class="wikitable" !

It was developed by [[Hirotsugu Akaike]], under the name of "an information criterion" ('''AIC'''), and was first published by Akaike in 1974.<ref name="Akaiki1974">Akaike, 1974</ref> It is grounded in the concept of [[information entropy]], in effect offering a relative measure of the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence|information lost]] when a given model is used to describe reality. It can be said to describe the tradeoff between [[bias]] and [[variance]] in model construction, or loosely speaking that of accuracy and complexity of the model. The AIC is not a test of the model in the sense of hypothesis testing; rather, it provides a means for comparison among models&mdash;a tool for [[model selection]]. Given a data set, several candidate models may be ranked according to their AIC, with the model having the minimum AIC being the best. From the AIC values one may also infer that e.g. the top two models are roughly in a tie and the rest are far worse. ==Definition== In the general case, the AIC is :<math>\mathit{AIC} = 2k - 2\ln(L)\,</math> where ''k'' is the number of [[parameter]]s in the [[statistical model]], and ''L'' is the maximized value of the [[likelihood]] function for the estimated model. Given a set of candidate models for the data, ''the preferred model is the one
