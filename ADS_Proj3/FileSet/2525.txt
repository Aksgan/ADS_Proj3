what they want to see on the reports and the format of the reports and in the case of regular reports, when they should be produced. Nowadays most of the application design tools provide easy to use friendly tools for quick reports development. e.g. report builder in [[Oracle database|Oracle]], [[Crystal Reports]], [[R&R Report Writer]] etc. # [[Software testing|Testing]] is performed at this stage. Application screens, various functions offered by the application screens, data validations through screens and reports are tested and it serves as the ultimate test of the correctness of the [[logical schema|database schema]] and the viability of the system as a whole. It is recommended to create a test database separate of the production database. The test database will be useful for testing any schema changes and new and modified application before applying the changes to the production (live) database. Careful testing of the system before handover will minimize the expense of later modifications to the schema and major applications. # The final stage is Handover. This is the stage where the users receive the finished database and applications and begin data entry. In practice, it is likely that the core of the system will be handed over to users and later extensions to the system will be implemented. ==Sources== * [http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=187264&direct=1 Open University Data base development life cycle] ==See also== *[[Systems development lifecycle]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Life Cycle Of A Relational Database}} [[Category:Database management systems]] [[Category:Relational database management systems]] [[ru:Жизненный цикл базы данных]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21623</id> <title>Life with PlayStation</title> <text>{{Infobox VG online service |title = Life with PlayStation |logo = [[File:LifewithPlayStationlogo.jpg|250px]] |developer = '''Life with PlayStation'''<br>[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]<br>'''Folding@Home Channel'''<br>[[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment of America]]<br>[[Stanford University]] / Pande Group |type = [[Virtual globe]]<br>[[Virtual]] [[encyclopedia]]<br>[[News client]]<br>[[Distributed computing]] |update = January 19, 2010 |version = 1.21 |released = September 18, 2008 |platform = [[PlayStation 3]] |website = [http://www.playstation.com/life/en/index.html Official Life With PlayStation website] }} '''Life with PlayStation''' is an online [[multimedia]] [[application software|application]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] [[video game console]] on the [[PlayStation Network]]. The application has four channels, all of which revolve around a virtual globe that displays information according to the channel. The application includes the one that it replaced, [[Folding@home]], which is a distributed computing project for understanding human [[diseases]] such as [[cancer]]. The application is focused around a virtual globe which depicts similar information to that of a [[news program]], allowing users to browse this information while simultaneously contributing to the Folding@home project. == History == Stanford announced in August 2006 that a [[Folding (chemistry)|folding]] client would be available to run on the Sony [[PlayStation 3]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://folding.stanford.edu/FAQ-PS3.html| title = PS3 FAQ| accessdate = 2006-11-13| author = Vijay Pande| date = 2006-10-22| publisher = Stanford University}}</ref> The intent was that gamers would be able to contribute to the project by merely "contributing electricity", leaving their PlayStation 3 consoles running the client while not playing games. PS3 firmware version 1.6 (released on Thursday, March 22, 2007) allows for Folding@home software, a 50 MB download, to be used on the PS3.<ref name="osstats">{{ cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=osstats | title = Client Statistics by OS | accessdate = 2008-01-05 |date= 2006-11-12 (updated automatically) | work = Folding@home distributed computing | publisher = Stanford University }}</ref> A peak output of the project at 990 teraFLOPS was achieved on March 25, 2007, at which time the number of FLOPS from each PS3 as reported by Stanford fell, reducing the overall speed rating of those machines by 50%. This had the effect of bumping down the overall project speed to the mid 700 range and increasing the number of active PS3s required to achieve a petaFLOPS level to around 60,000. [[Image:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The original Folding@Home client integrated into Life.]] On April 26, 2007, Sony released a new version of Folding@home which improved folding performance drastically, such that the updated PS3 clients produced 1500 teraFLOPS with 52,000 clients versus the previous 400 teraFLOPS by around 24,000 clients.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/folding%40home/ps3-folding-kicking-ass-getting-update-255086.php| title=PS3 Folding Kicking Ass, Getting Update}}</ref> Lately, the console accounts for around 26% of all teraFLOPS at an approximate ratio of 35½ PS3 clients per teraFLOPS. On December 19, 2007, Sony again updated the Folding@home client to version 1.3 to allow users to run music stored on their hard drives while contributing. Another feature of the 1.3 update allows users to automatically shut down their console after current work is done or after a limited period of time (for example 3 or 4 hours). Also, the software update added the [[Generalized Born]] implicit solvent model, so the FAH PS3 client gained more broad computing capabilities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.scei.co.jp/folding/en/update.html | title = Folding@home for PLAYSTATION3 Version 1.3 | accessdate = 2007-12-31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://blog.us.playstation.com/2007/12/18/new-foldinghome-features-coming/ | title = New Folding@home Features Coming | last = Rimon | first = Noam | date = 2007-12-18 | accessdate = 2007-12-31}}</ref> Shortly afterward, 1.3.1 was released to solve a mishandling of protocol resulting in difficulties sending and receiving Work Units due to heavy server loads stemming from the fault. On September 18, 2008 the Folding@home client became Life With PlayStation. In addition to the existing functionality, the application also provides the user with access to information "channels", the first of which being the ''Live Channel'' which offers news headlines and weather through a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] globe. The user can rotate and zoom in to any part of the world to access information provided by [[Google News]] and [[The Weather Channel]], among other sources, all running while folding in the background. This update also provided more advanced simulation of protein folding and a new ranking system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5051551/life-with-playstation-out-now|title=Life With PlayStation out now|publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref> == Channels == [[Image:LifeWithPlayStation Weather.jpg|right|220px|thumb|The "Live Channel" showing weather forecasts and news headlines for [[New York City]].
