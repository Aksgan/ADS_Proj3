The tool allows users to ask just about any question, such as how to cook "[[ramen]]" or how to subscribe to international magazines via the Internet, and get answers from other users. In this way, Knowledge Search was an early example of harnessing [[user-generated content]] to expand the amount of information available in the web, particularly in the [[Korean language]]. [[Bradley Horowitz]], Vice President of Product Strategy at Yahoo!, has cited<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elatable.com/blog/?p=35 |title=Buzz by Bradley Horowitz from Twitter |author= |date=April 13, 2010 |work=Blog |publisher= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref> the South Korean experience with knowledge search as the inspiration for [[Yahoo! Answers]], which was launched three years after Naver introduced the original service. As of January 2008 the Knowledge Search database included more than 80 million pages of user-generated information. '''Knowledge Search''' has four sub-categories: *''Knowledge Q&A'' allows for general questions about anything *''Local Q&A'' allows people to ask for local information such as good restaurants, cheap stores, and real estate. *''Agony Q&A'' is for people seeking advice on relationships, love, career, and sex (with anonymous posting enabled.) While ''Knowledge Q&A'' and ''Local Q&A'' provide factual answers, ''Agony Q&A'' usually returns more opinionated responses. *''Open Dictionary'' is a database of informative articles generated by users. Users can create an article alone, or enable other users to collaborate to create a thread of articles on the same subject. In addition, the user may add his or her own answers from ''Knowledge Q&A'' to ''Open Dictionary''. ==See also== *[[GirlsAskGuys]] *[[LinkedIn Answers]] *[[Mahalo.com]] *[[Yahoo!

The concept of [[knowledge management]] is based on a range of practices used by an [[individual]], a [[business]], and a large [[corporation]] to identify, create, represent and redistribute [[information]] for a range of purposes. Software that enables an information practice or range of practices at any part of the processes of information management can be deemed to be called [[information management]] software. A subset of information management software that emphasizes an approach to build knowledge out of information that is managed or contained is often called [[knowledge management]] software. KM Software in most cases provides a means of individuals, small groups or mid-sized businesses with ways to innovate, build new knowledge in the group, and/or improve customer experience. [[Knowledge management]] tools (software) includes a range of about 1,500 or more different approaches<ref> [http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=15156 KMWorld 100 Companies That Matter in Knowledge Management]. 1 Mar 2006. KMWorld </ref> to collect and contain information to then build knowledge that can be searched through specialised search tools including concept building tools and or visual search tools that present information in a connected manager not originally conceptualised by those collecting or maintaining the information database. ==Range of Knowledge Management Software== KM Software ranges from small software packages for an individual to use, such as [[brainstorming]] software, to [[Business Intelligence|highly specialised enterprise software]] suitable for use by hundreds of employees. Often KM Software provides a key resource for employees working in [[customer service]] or telephone support industries, or sectors of large corporations. KM software, in general, enables the combination of unstructured information sources, such as individual word
