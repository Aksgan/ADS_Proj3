Brawl]]'' |} Since 2002, GameFAQs has hosted [[wikt:annual|annual]] (or [[semiannual]]) [[tournament]] contests consisting of daily [[Opinion poll|polls]] in which visitors to the site choose between competing [[Character (arts)|characters]], games, or series, with the character contests being known as "Character Battles". Registered users can submit prediction [[bracket (tournament)|brackets]], and [[prize]]s are awarded to those who score the highest. The contest polls are shown in place of or in addition to the regular Poll of the Day and have always been accompanied by an image depicting the entrants in the match. The entrants of the Character Battles change from year to year, with some characters being added and some being removed. In some years, previous winners were removed from the main bracket and competed in a separate contest (i.e., "Tournament of Champions", "Battle Royale"). The annual Character Battle has been the subject of two [[webcomic]]s—''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' featured the Character Battle in their comic on August 23, 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/8/23/|title=Penny Arcade! - Heat|publisher=Penny Arcade|date=2002-08-23|accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref> and Creative Uncut's ''Inside the Gamers Studio'' strip mentioned the Character Battle in their ninth comic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeuncut.com/comic/whit009.html|title=''Inside the Gamers Studio'' comic|publisher=Creative Uncut|year=2003|accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref> ===10 Best Games Ever=== During the 10-Year Anniversary Contest in 2005, GameFAQs users voted on the 10 best games of all time (and tried to predict what the top 10 would be).

It is designed to be used as a [[User interface|UI]] library for [[Personal computer game|computer]] and [[console games]]. It is written in [[C++]], and compiles under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]], using [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[MSVC]]. It includes code for rendering with [[OpenGL]]. The rendering module is factored out so that the code can ported to other [[Application programming interface|APIs]]. GameSWF is used by other open source projects such as [[Gnash]]. It is also used in [[Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath]] [http://www.tulrich.com/geekstuff/gameswf_stranger_postmortem.html] and many [[Gameloft]] games to display user interface screens and menus such as the player's inventory. ==External links== * [http://www.tulrich.com/geekstuff/gameswf.html GameSWF project homepage] * [http://www.mxwendler.net Realtime video compositing software using gameswf] [[Category:Adobe Flash]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C++]] [[Category:Public domain software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:Linux graphics-related software]] {{free-software-stub}} [[ar:غيم إس دبليو إف]] [[sv:GameSWF]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14731</id> <title>GameSalad</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = GameSalad Creator | logo = | caption = GameSalad 0.7.0 under [[Mac OS X 10.6]]. | screenshot = | developer = [[Gendai Games]] | frequently updated = Yes | latest_release_version = 0.9 | latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2010|11|21}} | operating_system = [[Mac OS X]] | genre = [[Game engine]] / Multimedia Content Creator | website = [http://gamesalad.com/ GameSalad.com] }} GameSalad is an [[authoring tool]] developed by GameSalad, Inc.
