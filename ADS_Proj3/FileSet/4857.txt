the 3D surfaces of the CAD model can be used directly. It also includes graphical verification to automatically check for collisions and the maximum wire angle possible on each individual EDM machine. The latest version makes it easy to extract and link 4-axis wire paths. Dialog boxes guide the user through the process making it simple to add tags, create roughing and finishing wire paths, lead in and out moves, a range of corner strategies, and tag removal cycles. Postprocessors and technology libraries are included for all leading machines.<ref name="euromold2010">thomasnet.com, November 18, 2010, [http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/-A-Growing-Line-up-of-Productivity-Software-from-Sescoi-at-Euromold-587690 A Growing Line up of Productivity Software from Sescoi at Euromold]</ref> === WorkNC-CAD === WorkNC-CAD is a manufacturing CAD software with surface and [[solid modeling]] functions. It is included free as a standard integrated component of WorkNC. It provides features required to design and manufacture molds, dies, and tooling without the need for additional software applications or outsourcing. WorkNC-CAD has advanced intelligent surface morphing for filling simple or complex cavities, automatic 2D feature recognition and cycle definition for [[drilling]], [[counterboring]], [[reaming]] and tapping, as well as automatic mold and die core separation. === WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling === WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling (HM) is a 3D [[Computer-aided design|CAD software]] launched by [[Sescoi]] in 2010 for 3D model design, reparation and machining preparation, with surface design capabilities integrated with [[solid modeling]] functionality in a user friendly environment. It can be used as an independent CAD product. It is powered by [[D-Cubed]] software components from Siemens PLM.<ref name="siemens"/> WorkNC-CAD HM works on solid and surface models making use of parametric commands to easily manipulate and repair CAD data. Along with multiple CAD translators, it includes modules for [[Electrical discharge machining#Sinker EDM|electrode]] creation, [[Core (manufacturing)|core]]/cavity separation and [[Wire EDM]]. The WorkNC Electrode module makes use of the WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling capabilities to extract electrode shapes directly from solid or surface models. The electrode model can be modified and extended, and tool holders added from a library to produce a complete electrode. WorkNC's collision checking ensures the electrode does not collide with any surrounding surfaces, automatically adding extensions as required. Documentation and electrode coordinate systems are produced by the software to ensure correct positioning for the [[Electrical discharge machining|EDM]] operations.<ref name="euromold2010"/> WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling features include: * Large visualization area * Construction tree that enables simplified CAD/CAM entity management * Context menus accessible in the construction tree and in the graphic window * Access to features according to context * Real-time preview of surface and solid modeling functions * Configurable interface ([[keyboard shortcut]]s, position of adjustable [[toolbar]]s). When used in its standalone design version by toolmakers in their technical departments, it offers [[mold (manufacturing)|mold]], tool and [[die (manufacturing)|die]] businesses a uniform CAD product throughout the entire manufacturing process. === WorkXPlore 3D === {{main|WorkXPlore 3D}} [[WorkXPlore 3D]] is a high-speed collaborative viewer for analyzing and sharing 3D CAD files without having to rely on the original CAD application. The software is very easy to use and is designed for users who are not CAD experts to explore 2D/3D CAD files of multiple types. WorkXPlore enables the user to measure 3D parts and offers advanced analysis features allowing the user to determine undercut areas, plane surfaces, thickness, volumes, surfaces, weight and also to perform dynamic cross-sectional visualization. 2D drawings are no longer necessary as it is possible to directly add dimensional and geometric measurements, annotations and labels to the [[3D model]]. WorkXPlore 3D also allows the user to send 3D parts and assembly files to sub-contractors, customers or co-workers via a standalone and extremely compact application which can be easily transmitted via the Internet as an [[Executable|executable file]]. The recipient can immediately display and work on the 3D model received. WorkXPlore 3D can open and process large 3D files extremely quickly<ref>TCT magazine, “[http://www.tctmagazine.com/x/guideArticle.html?id=10269&browse=c&bid=649 WorkXPlore 3D award wining software]”</ref>.

A work order may be for products or services. In a manufacturing environment, a work order is converted from a [[sales order]] to show that work is about to be begin on the manufacture, building or engineering of the products requested by the customer. In a service environment, a work order can be equivalent to a service order where the WO records the location, date and time the service is carried out and the nature of work that is done. The type of personnel (e.g. job position) may also be listed on the WO. A rate (e.g. $/hr, $/week) and also the total amount of hours worked and total value is also shown on the work order. A work order may be a maintenance or repair request from students, faculty or staff in a university.<ref>[http://www.wm.edu/facman/workorder.php Facilities Management Request for Service], William & Mary University, wm.edu.</ref><ref>[http://daf.csulb.edu/offices/its/telecommunications/workorder/instructions.html Instructions for Completing Network & Telecommunications Work Order Form], California State University (Long Beach), csulb.edu.</ref> Orders received from outside an organization are often [[dispatch (logistics)|dispatched]] (reviewed and scheduled) before being executed.<ref>[http://www.corrigo.com/work-order-software/Default.aspx Corrigo work order flow diagram], www.corrigo.com.</ref> <ref>[http://www.dispatchedsoftware.com/dispatch%20software%20brochure.htm Dispatched work order flow diagram], www.dispatchedsoftware.com.</ref>Work orders may be for [[preventive maintenance]]<ref>[http://www.wds-software.com/ Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Software and Work Order Programs], wds-software.com.</ref> Contractors may use a single job work order and invoice form that contains the customer information, describes the work performed, lists charges for material and labor, and can be given to the customer as an invoice.<ref>[http://www.deluxeforms.com/ job work order and invoice form], see "Manual Forms",
