On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD will retire the "ATI" brand for its graphics chipsets, and will brand future products as "AMD".<ref>http://news.softpedia.com/news/AMD-Really-Dropping-the-ATI-Brand-154168.shtml</ref> ==Products== [[Image:Ruby's Revenge 1024.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ATI's Ruby fictional female character.]] In addition to developing high-end [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s (originally called a VPU, visual processing unit, by ATI) for PCs And Apple Macs, ATI also designs embedded versions for laptops (Mobility Radeon), [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s and [[mobile phone]]s ([[Imageon]]), integrated motherboards (Radeon IGP), and others. ATI promotes some of its products with the fictional "Ruby" female character, described as a "mercenary for hire."<ref>[http://ati.de/ruby/index.html Ruby's Headquarters at ATI.de]</ref> Computer-animated videos produced by RhinoFX about Ruby on a mission (being a sniper, saboteur, hacker and so on) are displayed at large technology shows such as ''CeBIT'' and [[Consumer Electronics Show|''CES'']]. ===Computer graphics chipsets=== {{Expand list|date=April 2010}} *'''[[ATI Wonder series|Graphics Solution / "Small Wonder"]]''' - Series of 8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] cards with [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]], [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and [[Plantronics Colorplus|Plantronics Color+]] compatibility. Later versions added [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] support. *'''[[ATI Wonder series|EGA / VGA Wonder]]''' - [[IBM]] "[[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]]/[[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]-compatible" display adapters (1987) *'''[[ATI Mach|Mach]] Series''' - Introduced ATI's first [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]] "Windows Accelerator". As the series evolved, GUI acceleration improved dramatically and early video acceleration appeared. *'''[[ATI Rage|Rage]] Series''' - ATI's first 2D and [[3D accelerator]] chips. The series evolved from rudimentary 3D with 2D GUI acceleration and [[MPEG-1]] capability, to a highly competitive [[Direct3D]] 6 accelerator with then "best-in-class" DVD ([[MPEG2]]) acceleration. The various chips were very popular with [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s of the time. The Rage II was used in the first ATI [[All-In-Wonder]] multi-function video card, and more advanced All-In-Wonders based on Rage series GPUs followed. (1995â€“2004) **'''[[ATI_Rage#Mobility|Rage Mobility]]''' - Designed for use in low-power environments, such as notebooks. These chips were functionally similar to their desktop counterparts, but had additions such as advanced [[power management]], [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] interfaces, and [[Multi monitor|dual monitor]] functionality. *'''[[Radeon]] Series''' - Launched in 2000, the Radeon line is ATI's brand for their consumer 3D accelerator add-in cards. The original ''Radeon DDR'' was ATI's first DirectX 7 3D accelerator, introducing their first hardware [[transform and lighting|T&L]] engine. ATI often produced 'Pro' versions with higher clock speeds, and sometimes an extreme 'XT' version, and even more recently 'XT Platinum Edition (PE)' and 'XTX' versions. The Radeon series was the basis for many ATI All-In-Wonder boards. **'''[[Radeon|Mobility Radeon]]''' - A series of power-optimized versions of Radeon graphics chips for use in laptops. They introduced innovations such as modularized RAM chips, [[DVD]] (MPEG2) acceleration, notebook GPU card sockets, and "[[ATI PowerPlay|PowerPlay]]" power management technology. AMD recently announced DirectX 11-compatible versions of its mobile processors<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.techworld.com/mobile-wireless/3209713/amd-launches-directx-11-graphics-chips-for-laptops/|title=AMD launches DirectX 11 graphics chips for laptops|date=2010-01-08| publisher=techworld.com|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref>. **'''[[ATI CrossFire]]''' - This technology was ATI's response to [[NVIDIA]]'s [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] platform. It allowed, by using a secondary video card and a dual PCI-E motherboard based on an ATI Crossfire-compatible chipset, the ability to combine the power of the two, three or four video cards to increase performance through a variety of different rendering options. There is an option for additional PCI-E video card plugging into the third PCI-E slot for gaming physics, or another option to do physics on the second video card<ref>[http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=5634 DailyTech report]</ref>. *'''[[FireGL]]''' - Launched in 2001, following ATI's acquisition of FireGL Graphics from [[Diamond Multimedia]]. Workstation CAD/CAM video card, based on the Radeon series. *'''[[FireMV]]''' - For workstations, featuring multi-view, a technology for the need of multiple displays for workstations with 2D acceleration only, usually based on the low-end products of the Radeon series. *'''[[FirePro]]''' - The follow-on to the FireGL cards, for workstations. *'''EyeFinity''' - Allows up to 6 monitors to be connected to one card to allow surround-screen panoramic view. *'''EyeSpeed''' - Allows you to experience games with true-to-life actions-and reactions. Things like physics effects, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more. ===Personal computer platforms and chipsets=== {{See also|Comparison of ATI chipsets|Comparison of AMD chipsets}} *'''[[Radeon R100|IGP 3x0]], [[Radeon R100|Mobility Radeon 7000 IGP]]''' - ATI's first chipsets. Included a DirectX 7-level 3D graphics processor. *'''[[Radeon R200|9100 IGP]]''' - 2nd generation system chipset. IXP250 southbridge. It was notable for being ATI's first complete motherboard chipset, including an ATI-built southbridge. It included an updated DirectX 8.1 class graphics processor<ref>Gavrichenkov, Ilya.
