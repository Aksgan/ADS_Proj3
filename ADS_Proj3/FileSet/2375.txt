wants to access a single computer from two or more (usually close) locations - for example, a public kiosk machine that also has a staff maintenance interface behind the counter, or a home office computer that doubles as a [[home theater PC]]. == Use == A user connects a monitor, keyboard, and mouse (and audio if provided for) to the console port on the KVM device and the computers to the other ports. KVMs can offer different methods of connecting to the computers. Depending on the port density and the type of connection, the KVM may present native connectors on the device where standard cables connect. Another method is a single DB25 or similar connector per port that connects to a special cable which has the video, keyboard and mouse connectors at the computer end. The advantage of the special cable approach is a reduction in the number of cables at the KVM. The disadvantage is the cost of these cables. Control is switched from one computer to another by the use of a switch or buttons on the KVM device, with the KVM passing the signals between the computers and the keyboard, mouse and monitor depending on which computer is currently selected. Most electronic KVMs allow control to be switched through keyboard commands (such as hitting a certain key, often Scroll Lock, rapidly two or three times) or via an On Screen Display (OSD) menu. Devices differ in the number of computers that can be connected, with anywhere from two up to 512 computers possible. Enterprise-grade devices can also be [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chained]] to allow even greater numbers of computers to be controlled from a single set of a keyboard, visual display unit and mouse. A KVM switch is useful where there are multiple computers, but no need for a dedicated keyboard, monitor and mouse for each one. They are frequently used in data centers where multiple [[Server (computing)|server]]s are placed in a single [[Rackmount|rack]] with a single keyboard, monitor and mouse. A KVM switch then allows data center personnel to connect to any server in the rack. A common example of home use is to enable the use of the full-size keyboard, mouse and monitor of the home PC with a portable device such as a [[laptop]], [[tablet PC]] or [[PDA]] or a computer using a different operating system. ==Video bandwidth== While [[HDMI]] and [[DVI]] switches are available on the market, VGA is still the most common video connector found with KVM switches. Analog switches can be built with varying capacities for video bandwidth, affecting the unit's overall cost and quality. A typical consumer-grade switch provides up to 200 MHz bandwidth, allowing for [[high-definition]] resolutions at 60 Hz. For analog video, resolution and refresh rate are the primary factors in determining the amount of bandwidth needed for the signal. The method of converting these factors into bandwidth requirements is a point of ambiguity, in part because it is dependent on the analog nature and state of the hardware. The same piece of equipment may require more bandwidth as it ages due to increased degradation of the source signal. Most conversion formulas attempt to approximate the amount of bandwidth needed, including a margin of safety.<ref>http://www.monitorworld.com/faq_pages/q29_page.html</ref><ref>http://www.maxim-ic.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/750</ref><ref>http://www.extron.com/company/article.aspx?id=vidband3</ref> As a rule of thumb, switch circuitry should provide up to three times the bandwidth required by the original signal specification, as this allows most instances of signal loss to be contained outside the range of the signal that is pertinent to picture quality. As [[CRT]]-based displays are dependent on refresh rate to prevent flickering, they generally require more bandwidth than comparable flat panel displays. == Monitor DDC/EDID == A monitor uses [[Display Data Channel|DDC]] and [[EDID]], transmitted through specific pins, to identify itself to the system. KVM switches may have different ways of handling these data transmissions: * None: the KVM switch lacks the circuitry to handle this data, and the monitor is not "visible" to the system. The system may assume a generic monitor is attached and defaults to safe settings. Higher resolutions and refresh rates may need to be manually unlocked through the video driver as a safety precaution. However, certain applications (especially games) that depend on retrieving DDC/EDID information will not be able to function correctly. * Fake: the KVM switch generates its own DDC/EDID information that may or may not be appropriate for the monitor that is attached. Problems may arise if there is an inconsistency between the KVM's specifications and the the monitor's, such as not being able to select desired resolutions. * Pass-through: the KVM switch attempts to make communication between the monitor and the system transparent. However, it may fail to do so in the following ways: ** generating Hot Plug Detect (HPD) events for monitor arrival or removal upon switching, or not passing monitor power states - may cause the OS to re-detect the monitor and reset the resolution and refresh rate, or may cause the monitor to enter to or exit from power-saving mode; ** not passing or altering MCSS commands - may result in incorrect orientation of the display or improper color calibration. The Windows Hardware Developer Channel guidelines recommend that KVM switches pass unaltered any [[IÂ²C|I<sup>2</sup>C]] traffic between the monitor and the PC hosts, and do not generate HPD events upon switching to a different port while maintaining stable non-noise signal on inactive ports.<ref name=W7DisplayGuide>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/GraphicsGuideWin7.mspx|title=WHDC: Graphics Guide for Windows 7|publisher=Microsoft|date=2009-06-12}}</ref><ref name=W7KVMGuidelines>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/KVM-Win7.mspx|title=WHDC: Display Guidelines for KVM Switches in Windows 7|publisher=Microsoft|date=2009-06-18}}</ref> == Passive and active (electronic) switches == KVM switches were originally passive, mechanical devices based on multi-pole [[switches]] and some of the cheapest devices on the market still use this technology. Mechanical switches usually have a rotary knob to select between computers. KVMs typically allow sharing of 2 or 4 computers, with a practical limit of about 12 machines imposed by limitations on available switch configurations. Modern hardware designs use active electronics rather than physical switch contacts with the potential to control many computers on a common system backbone. One
