(kHz) are rare.<ref name=Carr170-2/> The lower part of this range, below 100 kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators.<ref name=RockwellHow/> Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300 kHz.<ref name=Naval450/> The frequency response behaviour of all mechanical filters can be expressed as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An example of this is shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular [[Analogue filter#Approximation|finite element approximations]] to an ideal filter response of the [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] and [[Chebyshev filter]]s can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.<ref name=Naval450/><ref name=RockwellApps>Rockwell-Collins, [http://www.rockwellcollins.com/about/additionalproducts/collinsfilters/app_notes/index.html "Mechanical filter application notes"] <!-- retrieved 16 November 2009. --></ref> ===Semi-lumped designs=== [[File:Mechanical filter semi-lumped disk flexual.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Three thin disc resonators are coupled together with long rods towards the edge of the discs. Transducers on the first and second disc are coupled with rods connected on the opposite edge of the disc. The transducers are of the type shown in figure 4a and each has a small bias magnet nearby. A pair of pivots are shown on each disc at the 90° positions relative to the coupling rods.|'''Figure 10a.''' A semi-lumped design using disc flexural resonators and λ/2 coupling wires]] [[File:Mechanical filter semi-lumped equivalent circuit.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Circuit diagram depicting a ladder topology filter. The series branches consist of series LC circuits (three total) and the shunt branches consist of shunt LC circuits (two total).|'''Figure 10b.''' Equivalent circuit of the semi-lumped circuit above]] Frequencies of the order of [[megahertz]] (MHz) are above the usual range for mechanical filters. The components start to become very small, or alternatively the components are large compared to the signal wavelength. The [[lumped element model]] described above starts to break down and the components must be considered as [[distributed element model|distributed elements]]. The frequency at which the transition from lumped to distributed models takes place is much lower for mechanical filters than it is for their electrical counterparts. This is because mechanical vibrations travel at the speed of sound for the material the component is composed of. For solid components, this is many times (x15 for nickel-iron) the speed of sound in air ({{nowrap|343 m/s}}) but still considerably less than the speed of electromagnetic waves (approx. {{nowrap|3x10<sup>8</sup> m/s}} in vacuum). Consequently, mechanical wavelengths are much shorter than electrical wavelengths for the same frequency. Advantage can be taken of these effects by deliberately designing components to be distributed elements, and the components and methods used in electrical [[distributed element filter]]s can be brought to bear. The equivalents of [[stub (electronics)|stubs]] and [[quarter wave impedance transformer|impedance transformers]] are both achievable. Designs which use a mixture of lumped and distributed elements are referred to as semi-lumped.<ref name=Mason>Mason.</ref> An example of such a design is shown in figure 10a. The resonators are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the top diagram design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings.<ref name=Mason/> For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below. ===Bridging wires=== Bridging wires are rods that couple together resonators that are not adjacent. They can be used to produce [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of attenuation in the [[stopband]]. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the [[passband]] edge, it also has the benefit of increasing [[roll-off]] and narrowing the [[transition band]]. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.<ref>Taylor & Huang, p.361.</ref> [[File:Mechanical filter bridged resonators.svg|thumb|center|800px|alt=A generic filter is depicted, consisting of a chain of coupled resonators, in four different bridging configurations. Filter (a) has no bridging wires, (b) has briding between resonators 3 and 5, (c) has bridging between resonators 2 and 5, and (d) has briding between resonators 2 and 6 and resonators 3 and 5. The
