It documents Flannery's experiences in the highlands of [[Papua New Guinea]] and Indonesian [[Western New Guinea]]. The book describes the flora and fauna of the island and the cultures of the various tribes. The title is an anglicised spelling of the [[Tok Pisin|New Guinean Pidgin]] "Toromwe Lek." It is a syllabus choice for the HSC English Advanced course in NSW, Australia. {{science-book-stub}} [[Category:Science books]] [[Category:Australian books]] [[Category:Books by Tim Flannery]] [[Category:Western New Guinea]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37679</id> <title>Thue (programming language)</title> <text>'''Thue''' ({{pronEng|ˈtuːeɪ}} "TOO-ay") is an [[esoteric programming language]] invented by [[John Colagioia]] in early 2000. It is a meta-language that can be used to define or recognize Type-0 languages from the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]. Because it is able to define languages of such complexity, it is also [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] itself. Thue is based on a [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]] [[String rewriting|string rewriting system]] called [[semi-Thue grammar]], which itself is named after (and possibly created by{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}) the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Axel Thue]]; inspiration is also taken from the [[Grue (monster)|grue]]. The author describes it as follows: "Thue represents one of the simplest possible ways to construe [[constraint programming|constraint-based programming]]. It is to the constraint-based paradigm what languages like [[OISC]] are to the imperative paradigm; in other words, it's a [[Turing tarpit|tar pit]]." ==Production rules== A Thue program starts with a rulebase, which is a series of substitution rules, each of this form: ''lhs'' ::= ''rhs'' The rulebase terminates with a lone production symbol on a line: ::= The initial state is a series of symbols which follow the rulebase. Thue consumes the initial symbols and substitutes the result of the rules for each of the initial state's symbols. Thue terminates when lhs cannot be found in a resultant state. ==Notes== *'''''::=''''' is pronounced ''can be''. *''lhs'' is "left hand side". *''rhs'' is "right hand side". *'''"''::=''"''' can never be the lhs. *":::" is an input stream. *"~" is the output stream. * Semi-Thue systems are isomorphic to [[unrestricted grammar]]s. ==Calling Thue== When invoked with 'd' (debug), print the state. When invoked with 'l' (left side), apply the rules left-to-right. When invoked with 'r' (right side), apply the rules right-to-left. The last 'l' or 'r' overrides the previous switches. ==Sample programs== Here's the traditional "Hello World!" in Thue: a::=~Hello World! ::= a The following Thue program performs an increment of a binary number entered as the initial state surrounded by "_" characters, in this case the number 1111111111: 1_::=1++ 0_::=1 01++::=10 11++::=1++0 _0::=_ _1++::=10 ::= _1111111111_ The following sample program is to demonstrate Thue's nondeterminism (and to show an example of an infinite loop, besides). The program outputs bits in an undefined (and quite possibly random) sequence. b::=~0 b::=~1 ac::=abc ::= abc ==External links== *[http://catseye.tc/projects/thue/ The Thue Programming Language] *[http://catseye.tc/projects/thue/doc/thue.txt Thue FAQ] *[http://esoteric.voxelperfect.net/wiki/Thue Thue at the Esolang wiki] *[http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/08/friday_pathological_programmin_2.php Blog post on Thue] *[http://web.archive.org/web/20031210145310/http://cyberspace.org/~lament/thue.html Javascript Thue interpreter] [[Category:Esoteric programming languages]] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[fr:Thue (langage)]] [[pt:Thue]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37684</id> <title>TiHKAL</title> <text>{{Infobox Book | name = TiHKAL: The Continuation | image = [[Image:Tihkal.jpg|200px]] | image_caption = Cover of TiHKAL, 1st ed. | author = [[Alexander Shulgin|Alexander]] and [[Ann Shulgin]] | cover_artist = | country = [[United States]] | subject = [[Pharmacology]], [[Autobiography]], [[Psychedelic drug]]s | publisher = Transform Press | release_date = 1997 | media_type = Paperback | pages = ''xxviii'', 804 p. | isbn = 0-9630096-9-9 | oclc= 38503252 | preceded_by = [[PiHKAL]] }} {{Distinguish|Tical (disambiguation)}} '''''TiHKAL''''' is a 1997 book written by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and [[Ann Shulgin]] about a family of [[psychoactive drug]]s known as [[tryptamine]]s. A sequel to ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', the full title of the book is '''''Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved: The Continuation'''''. ==Content== ''TiHKAL'', much like its predecessor ''PiHKAL'', is divided into two parts. The first part, for which all rights are reserved, begins with a fictionalized autobiography, continuing where the similar section of ''PiHKAL'' left off; it then continues with a collection of essays on topics ranging from [[psychotherapy]] and the [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian mind to the prevalence of [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] in nature, [[ayahuasca]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. The second part of ''TiHKAL'', which may be conditionally distributed for non-commercial reproduction (see [[#External links|external links]] below), is a detailed synthesis manual for 55 psychedelic compounds (many discovered by Alexander Shulgin himself), including their chemical structures, dosage recommendations, and qualitative comments. Like ''PiHKAL'', the Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public's access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times.<ref name="nyt"> {{cite news |first = Drake |last = Bennett |author = |coauthors = |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html |title = Dr. Ecstasy |work = New York Times Magazine |publisher = [[New York Times]] |pages = |page = |date = 2005-01-30 |accessdate = 2006-07-08 }}</ref> Following a raid of his laboratory in 1994 by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|United States DEA]],<ref> {{cite web | title = DEA Raid of Shulgin's Laboratory | publisher = [[Erowid]] | date = 2004-01-08 | url = http://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/shulgin_alexander/shulgin_alexander_raid.shtml | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2006-07-08 }}</ref> Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, stated that "It is our opinion that those books [referring to the previous work, [[PiHKAL]]] are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books." This attitude emphasized Shulgin's need to release the information to ensure its preservation, and led to the release of ''TiHKAL'' and his other publications. ==Tryptamines Listed== {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- ! !
