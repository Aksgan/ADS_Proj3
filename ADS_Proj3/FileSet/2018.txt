systems, [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]] is still present. Turing's writing made it clear that oracle machines were only mathematical abstractions, and were not thought of as physically realizable.<ref>"Let us suppose that we are supplied with some unspecified means of solving number-theoretic problems; a kind of oracle as it were. We shall not go any further into the nature of this oracle apart from saying that it cannot be a machine" (Undecidable p. 167, a reprint of Turing's paper ''Systems of Logic Based On Ordinals'')</ref> ==Hypercomputation vs. The Church-Turing Thesis== The [[Church-Turing Thesis]] states that anything that is computable can be computed by a Turing machine. Hypercomputers can theoretically compute functions that a Turing machine cannot. So, if machines capable of performing hypercomputational supertasks are taken to be physically realizable, they may be considered pragmatic counterexamples to the thesis. This would push the limit of what is physically computable to a point much further beyond what has been generally accepted for decades. An example of a problem that a hypercomputer can solve that a Turing machine cannot is the [[Halting problem]]. A Turing machine cannot decide if an arbitrary program halts or runs forever. A hypercomputer, though, can run a program for an infinite amount of time and tell the user whether or not the program halted. If a solution is found, it gives the user the solution. If it runs for an eternity and finds no solution, it can tell the user that it never halted. ==Hypercomputer proposals== *A Turing machine that can ''complete'' infinitely many steps. Simply being able to run for an unbounded number of steps forever, (i.e. potential infinity) does not suffice. One proposed approach is the [[Zeno machine]] (inspired by [[Zeno's paradox]]), a purely mathematical model. The Zeno machine performs its first computation step in (say) 1 minute, the second step in ½ minute, the third step in ¼ minute, etc. By summing the infinite [[geometric series]] 1+½+¼+... we see that the machine performs infinitely many steps in a total of 2 minutes. However, some people claim that, following the reasoning from [[Zeno's paradox]], Zeno machines are not just physically impossible, but logically impossible.<ref>These models have been independently developed by many different authors, including {{cite book|author=[[Hermann Weyl]]| year=1927 | title=Philosophie der Mathematik und Naturwissenschaft}}; the model is discussed in {{cite journal |author=Shagrir, O. |title=Super-tasks, accelerating Turing machines and uncomputability |journal=Theor.

This might require quite bizarre laws of physics (for example, a measurable [[physical constant]] with an oracular value, such as [[Chaitin's constant]]), and would at minimum require the ability to measure a real-valued physical value to arbitrary precision despite [[thermal noise]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]]. * A technique known as [[fair nondeterminism]] or [[unbounded nondeterminism]] may allow the computation of noncomputable functions.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Edith Spaan, Leen Torenvliet and Peter van Emde Boas|title=Nondeterminism, Fairness and a Fundamental Analogy|journal=EATCS bulletin|volume=37|pages=186–193|year=1989}}</ref> There is dispute in the literature over whether this technique is coherent, and whether it actually allows noncomputable functions to be "computed". *The use of [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTC), contrary to the beliefs of some, do not appear to permit hypercomputation, since they do not provide the unbounded amount of storage that an infinite computation would require. However, access to a CTC may allow the rapid solution to [[PSPACE-complete]] problems, a complexity class which while Turing-decidable is generally considered computationally intractable.<ref>Todd A.
