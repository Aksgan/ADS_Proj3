testing problem is of [[Big-oh|exponential order]] ([[Big-oh|<math>O(c^n),\;c>1</math>]]) and every fuzzer takes shortcuts to find something interesting in a timeframe that a human cares about. A primitive fuzzer may have poor [[code coverage]]; for example, if the input includes a [[checksum]] which is not properly updated to match other random changes, only the checksum validation code will be verified. Code coverage tools are often used to estimate how "well" a fuzzer works, but these are only guidelines to fuzzer quality. Every fuzzer can be expected to find a different set of bugs. On the other hand, bugs found using fuzz testing are sometimes severe, exploitable bugs that could be used by a real attacker. This has become more common as fuzz testing has become more widely known, as the same techniques and tools are now used by attackers to exploit deployed software. This is a major advantage over binary or source auditing, or even fuzzing's close cousin, [[fault injection]], which often relies on artificial fault conditions that are difficult or impossible to exploit. The randomness of inputs used in fuzzing is often seen as a disadvantage, as catching a boundary value condition with random inputs is highly unlikely. Fuzz testing enhances [[software security]] and [[safety engineering|software safety]] because it often finds odd oversights and defects which human testers would fail to find, and even careful human test designers would fail to create tests for. == References == {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== * ISBN 0321446119, ''Fuzzing: Brute Force Vulnerability Discovery'', Michael Sutton, Adam Greene, Pedram Amini * ISBN 978-1-59693-214-2, ''Fuzzing for Software Security Testing and Quality Assurance'', Ari Takanen, Jared D.

The editors-in-chief (as of 2010) are Bernard De Baets of the Dept. of Applied Mathematics, Biometrics and Process Control, (at the University of Gent in Belgium), [[Didier Dubois]] (of IRIT, Université Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France) and Eyke Hüllermeier (of the Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science, Universität Marburg, Germany). The journal publishes 24 issues a year. ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' is abstracted and indexed by [[Scopus]] and the [[Science Citation Index]]. According to the [[Journal Citation Reports]] released in 2009, its 2-year impact factor calculated for 2008 is 1.833 and its 2008 5-year impact factor for 2008 is 2.303. == See also == * [[Fuzzy Control System]] * [[Fuzzy Control Language]] * [[Fuzzy logic]] * [[Fuzzy set]] [[Category:Fuzzy logic]] [[Category:Computer science journals]] [[Category:Publications established in 1978]] [[Category:Elsevier academic journals]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14454</id> <title>Fuzzy cognitive map</title> <text>A '''Fuzzy cognitive map''' is a [[cognitive map]] within which the relations between the elements (e.g. concepts, events, project resources) of a "mental landscape" can be used to compute the "strength of impact" of these elements. The theory behind that computation is [[fuzzy logic]]<ref>[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Cognitive Maps'', International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 24(1986) 65-75 (first introduction of FCMs): [http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/FCM.pdf] see also [http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/Virtual_Worlds_FCM.pdf]</ref>. Fuzzy cognitive maps are signed fuzzy digraphs. They may look at first blush like [[Hasse diagrams]] but they are not. [[Spreadsheet]]s or tables are used to map FCMs into [[Matrix (Mathematics)|Matric]]es for further computation<ref>On line calculator and downloadable Java applications for FCM computations: http://www.ochoadeaspuru.com/fuzcogmap/index.php</ref><ref>Java standalone library for FCM computations: http://jfcm.megadix.it/</ref>. A simple application of FCMs is described in a book<ref name="confusion">William R.

Taylor, where the war in Afghanistan and Iraq is analyzed. And in [[Bart Kosko]]'s book ''Fuzzy Thinking''<ref name="FuzzyThinking">Bart Kosko: ''Fuzzy Thinking'', 1993/1995, ISBN 0-7868-8021-X (Chapter 12: Adaptive Fuzzy Systems)''</ref>, several Hasse diagrams illustrate the use of FCMs. As an example, one FCM quoted from Rod Taber<ref name="Drugs">Rod Taber: ''Knowledge Processing with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps'', Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 2, no. 1, 83-87, 1991 ([[:de:Bild:FCMdrug520.png|Hasse diagram]] in German Wikipedia)</ref> describes 11 factors of the American cocaine market and the relations between these factors. For computations, Taylor uses pentavalent logic (scalar values out of {-1,-0.5,0,+0.5,+1}). That particular map of Taber uses trivalent logic (scalar values out of {-1,0,+1}). Taber et al. also illustrate the dynamics of map fusion and give a theorem on the convergence of combination in a related article <ref name='Medical'>Rod Taber, Ronald R. Yager, and Cathy M.
