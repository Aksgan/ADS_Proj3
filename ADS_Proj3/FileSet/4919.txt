It is quite fast due to [[Array data structure|array]] syntax, and extensible via [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]] routines. It was created in 1996 by [[David H. Munro]] of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. == Features == * Indexing Yorick is good at manipulating elements in N-dimensional arrays conveniently with its powerful syntax. ;Range of indices Several elements can be accessed all at once: <source lang="python"> > x=[1,2,3,4,5,6]; > x [1,2,3,4,5,6] > x(3:6) [3,4,5,6] > x(3:6:2) [3,5] > x(6:3:-2) [6,4] </source> ;Arbitrary elements <source lang="python"> > x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > x [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > x([2,1],[1,2]) [[2,1],[5,4]] > list=where(1<x) > list [2,3,4,5,6] > y=x(list) > y [2,3,4,5,6] </source> ;Pseudo-index Like "theading" in PDL (Perl Data Language) and "broadcasting" in Numpy ( Numeric extension for Python), Yorick has a mechanism to do this: <source lang="python"> > x=[1,2,3] > x [1,2,3] > y=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > y [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > y(-,) [[[1],[2],[3]],[[4],[5],[6]]] > x(-,) [[1],[2],[3]] > x(,-) [[1,2,3]] > x(,-)/y [[1,1,1],[0,0,0]] > y=[[1.,2,3],[4,5,6]] > x(,-)/y [[1,1,1],[0.25,0.4,0.5]] </source> ;Rubber index ".." is a rubber-index to represent zero or more dimensions of the array. <source lang="python"> > x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > x [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > x(..,1) [1,2,3] > x(1,..) [1,4] > x(2,..,2) 5 </source> "*" is a kind of rubber-index to reshape a slice(sub-array) of array to a vector. <source lang="python"> > x(*) [1,2,3,4,5,6] </source> ;Tensor multiplication Tensor multiplication is done as follows in Yorick: P(,+,,)*Q(,,+) means <math>\sum_{j=1}^{j=N}{P_{ijkl}Q_{mnj}}</math> <source lang="python"> > x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > x [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] > y=[[7,8],[9,10],[11,12]] > x(,+)*y(+,) [[39,54,69],[49,68,87],[59,82,105]] > x(+,)*y(,+) [[58,139],[64,154]] </source> ==External links== *[http://yorick.sourceforge.net Yorick Homepage] [[Category:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] [[Category:Programming languages created in 1996]] [[Category:Array programming languages]] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[fr:Yorick]] [[ms:Bahasa pengaturcaraan Yorick]] [[pt:Yorick (linguagem de programação)]] [[fi:Yorick]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40937</id> <title>Yuan Wang</title> <text>{{BLP sources|date=July 2010}} '''Yuan Wang''' is a [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] and has been the director of the [[Paleozoological Museum of China]]<ref>{{cite press release| publisher = Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences| date = 17 November 2009| title = Scientific counselor to the President of France visited IVPP| url = http://english.ivpp.cas.cn/ns/icn/200911/t20091117_47361.html| accessdate = 29 July 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5rabaoadn| archivedate = 29 July 2010 }}</ref> (PMC) since 2004.
