WordStar was actively used by several hundred members of the WordStar Users Group Mailing List. They provided technical support for each other via the long-running mailing list which started in May 1996 and has continued until a recent{{when|date=July 2010}} interruption. WordStar was the program of choice for conservative intellectual [[William F. Buckley Jr.]],<ref name=feigenson764>[http://feigenson.us/blog/?p=764 William F Buckley and WordStar]</ref> who used the software to write a plethora of works including the last book he authored before his death. This was noted by his son, Christopher Buckley, who wrote of the almost comical loyalty and affection his father had shown for WordStar, which he had installed into every new computer he purchased despite the technical difficulty of such an endeavor as the program became increasingly outdated and incompatible. He is quoted as having said, in a Time Magazine article:<ref name=feigenson764 /> {{quote|"I'm told there are better programs, but I'm also told there are better alphabets."}} Canadian science fiction author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] continues to use a customized version of WordStar for DOS to write his novels,<ref>http://www.sfwriter.com/2009/06/rjs-on-wordstar-cited-in-paper-about.html</ref> as does [[George R.R. Martin]]. == Interface == WordStar is still considered by many to be one of the best examples of a "writing program." {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Because it was designed for text-only display devices with only a single, functional typeface, the primary focus was on the text, without direct onscreen [[WYSIWYG]] formatting. Because typesetting and layout were secondary or tertiary functions left for after the document was written, edited, and proofread, the writer was not distracted by the many formatting possibilities presented by later word processors. As initially installed, in text-mode versions of WordStar, approximately the top 1/3 of the screen was a menu of commands, with the very top line being a display of the position within the file and the user's text occupying the lower 2/3 of the screen. A user-configurable option to set the help level released this space for user text. The help system could be configured to display help a short time after the first key of a command sequence was entered. As users became more familiar with the command sequences, the help system could be set to provide less and less assistance until finally all on-screen menus and status information was turned off. The original [[computer terminal]]s and microcomputers for which WordStar was developed did not have an array of separate function keys or cursor control keys (e.g., arrow keys, Page Up/Down), so WordStar used sequences of alphabetic keys combined with the "Control" key. For touch typists, in addition, reaching the function and cursor keys generally requires them to take their fingers off the "home keys" with consequent loss of typing rhythm. For example, the "diamond" of Ctrl-S/E/D/X moved the cursors one character or line to the left, up, right, or down. Ctrl-A/F (to the outside of the "diamond") moved the cursor a full word left/right, and Ctrl-R/C (just "past" the Ctrl keys for up and down) scrolled a full page up/down. Prefacing these keystrokes with Ctrl-Q generally expanded their action, moving the cursor to the end/beginning of the line, end/beginning of the document, etc. [[Backspace|Ctrl-H]] would backspace and delete. Commands to enable bold or italics, printing, blocking text to copy or delete, saving or retrieving files from disk, etc. were typically a short sequence of keystrokes, such as Ctrl-P-B for bold, or Ctrl-K-S to save a file. Formatting codes would appear on screen, such as ''^B'' for bold, ''^Y'' for italics, and ''^S'' for underscoring. Although many of these keystroke sequences were far from self-evident, they tended to lend themselves to [[mnemonic]] devices (e.g., Ctrl-'''P'''rint-'''B'''old, Ctrl-bloc'''K'''-'''S'''ave), and regular users quickly learned them through [[muscle memory]], enabling them to rapidly navigate documents by touch, rather than memorizing "Ctrl-S = cursor left." Some users believe that the relocation of the Ctrl key from the position just to the left of the ''A'' key on the [[IBM Personal Computer XT|PC XT]]-era keyboard (where Caps-Lock is found on modern keyboards), to the far lower left, interferes with this tactile approach, unless the keyboard is remapped in software to swap these keys.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Other users prefer to have two control keys on either side of the space bar, which facilitates eight-finger touch typing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Indeed, WordStar can be regarded as a third keyboard interface: #the lower-case letters and numbers, #upper-case letters and symbols accessed by the Caps key, and #editing and formatting made possible by the Ctrl keys. WordStar had relative weaknesses, such as an inability to
