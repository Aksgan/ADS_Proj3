She proposed the [[SPMD]] programming model in 1984 and [[Dynamic Data Driven Application System]]s (DDDAS) in 2000. She was elected [[IEEE Fellow]] in 2004. ==Biography== Dr. Darema received her BS degree from the School of Physics and Mathematics of the [[University of Athens]] - Greece, and MS and Ph. D. degrees in Theoretical Nuclear Physics from the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of California at Davis]], respectively, where she attended as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] and a Distinguished Scholar. After Physics Research Associate positions at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], she received an APS Industrial Fellowship and became a Technical Staff Member in the Nuclear Sciences Department at [[Schlumberger Doll Research]]. Subsequently, in 1982, she joined the [[International Business Machines|IBM]] [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] as a Research Staff Member in the Computer Sciences Department and later-on she established and became the manager of a research group at IBM Research on parallel applications. Dr. Darema was at the [[National Science Foundation]] since 1994, where she has managed the New Generation Software and Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems programs. During 1996-1998 she completed a two-year assignment at [[DARPA]]. She is now at the [[Air Force Office of Scientific Research]]. ==External links== *[http://parasol.tamu.edu/lcpc03/darema.php Frederica Darema, Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems, LCPC 2003: The 16th International Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing] *[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9204 AFOSR: Mathematics, Information and Life Sciences].

He was awarded the 1995 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his co-detection of the [[neutrino]] with [[Clyde Cowan]] in the [[neutrino experiment]], and may be the only scientist in history "so intimately associated with the discovery of an [[elementary particle]] and the subsequent thorough investigation of its fundamental properties".<ref>[http://www.ps.uci.edu/physics/reinestrib.html Frederick Reines and the Neutrino, Jonas Schultz and Hank Sobel]</ref> == Early life == Reines was born in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the son of [[Jewish refugees|Jewish emigrants to the US from Russia]] and a paternal relative of the [[Rabbi]] [[Yitzchak Yaacov Reines]], as the youngest of four children.<ref name = "NAS">{{Citation | last = Kropp | first = William | last2 = Schultz | first2 = Jonas |last2 - Sobel |first3 = Henry | title = Frederick Reines 1918-1998 A Biographical Memoir | place = Washington D.C. | publisher = [[National Academy of Science]] | origyear = | year = 2009 | pages = | url = http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/freines.pdf | accessdate = 2010-03-17 | isbn = }}</ref> Reines and his family moved to upstate [[New York]], where he spent much of his childhood in a small town where his father ran a country store. Looking back, Reines said: "My early childhood memories center around this typical American country store and life in a small American town, including [[Independence Day (United States)|4 July]] celebrations marked by fireworks and patriotic music played from a pavilion bandstand."<ref name="autob">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1995/reines-autobio.html Frederick Reines, Nobel Prize in Physics 1995, Autobiography]</ref> Reines later lived in [[North Bergen, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Horace Mann]] Elementary School, and then in [[Union City, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Union Hill High School]]. He had a variety of extracurricular activities, participation in his school’s singing group, and being a member of the History Forum, editor-in-chief of the school yearbook and an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref name="autob"/> == Discovery of an early passion for science == Reines had a passion for creating and building things, and exhibited a love of science in his childhood. In his autobiography given to the Nobel Prize Committee, he recalled, “The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to [[simulate]] a [[telescope]], I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of [[diffraction]]. That began for me a fascination with light." Ironically, Reines’ excelled in literary and history courses, but received average or low marks in science and math in his freshman year of high school, though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of an unidentified teacher who gave him a key to the school laboratory and gave him permission to work whenever he wanted. This cultivated a love of science in Reines by his senior year, and led him in the direction of a career in science. In response to a question seniors were asked for a yearbook quote,
