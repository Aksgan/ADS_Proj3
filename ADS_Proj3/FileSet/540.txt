later that it was a common expression in his native Texas and that he did not think much of the phrase. When the short was first screened in theaters, the "What's up, Doc?" scene generated a tremendously positive audience reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Joe|title=Tex Avery: King of Cartoons|location=[[New York]]|publisher=De Capo Press|year=1975}}</ref> As a result, the scene became a recurring element in subsequent films and cartoons. The phrase was sometimes modified for a situation. For example, Bugs says "What's up, dogs?" to the antagonists in ''[[A Hare Grows in Manhattan]]'', "What's up, Duke?" to the knight in ''[[Knight-mare Hare]]'' and "What's up, prune-face?" to the aged Elmer in ''[[The Old Grey Hare]]''. He might also greet Daffy with "What's up, Duck?" He used one variation, "What's all the hub-bub, bub?" only once, in ''[[Falling Hare]].'' Another variation is used in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back In Action]]'' when he greets a [[lightsaber]]-wielding [[Marvin the Martian]] saying "What's up, [[Darth Vader|Darth]]?" Several Chuck Jones shorts in the late 1940s and 1950s depict Bugs travelling via cross-country (and, in some cases, intercontinental) tunnel-digging, ending up in places as varied as Mexico (''[[Bully For Bugs]]'', 1953), the [[Himalayas]] (''[[The Abominable Snow Rabbit]]'', 1960) and [[Antarctica]] (''[[Frigid Hare]]'', 1949) all because he "shoulda taken that left toin at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albukoikee]]." He first utters that phrase in ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'' (1945), when he emerges in the [[Black Forest]], a cartoon seldom seen today due to its blatantly topical subject matter. When [[Hermann GÃ¶ring]] says to Bugs, "There is no Las Vegas in 'Chermany'" and takes a potshot at Bugs, Bugs dives into his hole and says, "Joimany! Yipe!", as Bugs realizes he's behind enemy lines. The confused response to his "left toin" comment also followed a pattern. For example, when he tunnels into Scotland in 1948's ''[[My Bunny Lies Over The Sea]]'', while thinking he's heading for the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], it provides another chance for an ethnic stereotype: "Therrre's no La Brrrea Tarrr Pits in Scotland!" (to which Bugs responds, "Uh...what's up, Mac-doc?"). A couple of late-1950s shorts of this ilk also featured [[Daffy Duck]] travelling with Bugs ("Since when is [[Pismo Beach]] inside a cave?!"). Bugs Bunny has some similarities to figures from [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], such as [[Br'er Rabbit]], [[Nanabozho]], or [[Anansi]], and might be seen as a modern [[trickster]] (for example, he repeatedly uses [[cross-dressing]] mischievously). Unlike most cartoon characters, however, Bugs Bunny is rarely defeated in his own games of trickery. One exception to this is the short ''[[Hare Brush]]'', in which Elmer Fudd ultimately carries the day at the end; however, critics note that in this short, Elmer and Bugs assume each other's personalities&mdash;through mental illness and hypnosis, respectively&mdash;and it is only by becoming Bugs that Elmer can win. However, Bugs was beaten at his own game. In the short ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' he torments Daffy Duck as the unseen animator, ending with his line, "Ain't I a stinker?" Bugs feels the same wrath of an unseen animator in the short ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' where he is in turn tormented by Elmer Fudd. At the end of the clip Elmer gleefully exclaims, 'Well, I finally got even with that scwewy wabbit!" Although it was usually [[Porky Pig]] who brought the WB cartoons to a close with his stuttering, "That's all, folks!", Bugs would occasionally appear, bursting through a drum just as Porky did, but munching a carrot and saying in his Bronx-Brooklyn accent, "And dat's de end!" The name "[[Bugs (disambiguation)|Bugs]]" or "[[Bugsy (disambiguation)|Bugsy]]" as an old-fashioned nickname means "crazy" (or "loopy"). Several famous people from the first half of the twentieth century had that nickname. It is now out of fashion as a nickname, but survives in 1950s-1960s expressions like "you're bugging me", as in "you're driving me crazy". Bugs wears white gloves, which he is rarely seen without. One example is the episode ''[[Long-Haired Hare]]'', where Bugs pretends to be the famed conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] and instructs opera star "Giovanni Jones" to sing and to hold a high note. As Giovanni Jones is turning red with the strain, Bugs slips his left hand out of its glove, leaving the glove hovering in the air in order to command Jones to continue to hold the high note. Bugs then nips down to the mail drop to order, and then to receive, a pair of ear muffs. Bugs puts on the ear defenders and then zips back into the amphitheater and reinserts his hand into his glove as singer Jones is writhing on the stage, still holding that same high note. Bugs Bunny is also a master of disguise: he can wear any disguise that he wants to confuse his enemies: in ''[[Bowery Bugs]]'' he uses diver disguises: fakir, gentleman, woman, baker and finally policeman. This ability of disguise makes Bugs famous because we can recognize him while at the same time realizing that his enemies are trapped. Bugs has a certain preference for the female disguise: Taz, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam were fooled by this sexy bunny (woman) and in ''[[Hare Trimmed]]'', Sam discovers the real face of "Granny" (Bugs's disguise) in the church where they attempt to get married. For all the gullible victims of all these disguises, however, for some reason, Daffy Duck and Cecil Turtle are among those who are never fooled. Bugs Bunny may also have some mystical potential. In ''[[Knight-mare Hare]]'' he was able to return to his bunny form (after being transformed into a donkey) by removing his donkey form as if it were a suit. Merlin of Monroe (the wizard) was unable to do the same thing. Later Bugs Bunny defeated the [[Count Blood Count]] in a magical spell duel. However, the story was a dream and Bugs Bunny's victory over Count Blood Count was a result of his intellect, not innate magical power. ===Rabbit or hare?=== The animators throughout Bugs' history have treated the terms [[rabbit]] and [[hare]] as synonymous. Taxonomically, they are '''''NOT''''' synonymous, being somewhat similar but observably different types
