Transall group in 1959 for the development and production of the C-160 for the air forces of France, Germany, South Africa and Turkey. Production of the aircraft by the three companies ended in 1972, with 169 aircraft having been delivered. In 1976, responsibility for production of the aircraft was given to Aerospatiale in France and MBB (now DaimlerChrysler Aerospace) in Germany. Both companies are now part of EADS (European Aeronautics Defence and Space). Production of the aircraft from 1976 to 1985 included updated avionics, a reinforced wing housing and additional fuel tanks. French Transalls were upgraded in 1999, with a new head-up display and an upgraded electronic warfare suite, with a radar warning receiver, missile approach warner and chaff and decoy dispensers. Navigational systems include EFIS 854 TF Electronic Flight Instrumentation System, which includes an Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) and Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI). Three new sensors have been installed for aircraft position and attitude control: an inertial reference unit (IRU), an attitude and heading reference unit (AHRU), and a global positioning system (GPS). A flight management system with two Gemini 10 computers and a new radio management system have also been installed. The Transalls provided NATO SIGINT in Bosnia <ref name=Wentz>{{citation | author = Wentz, Larry | title = Lessons From Bosnia: The IFOR Experience, IV.

For a number of years, France operated DC-8 aircraft "Sarigue" dedicated to ELINT<ref name=SpyflightFrance>{{Citation | title = Douglas DC-8 Sarigue NG | journal = The Spyflight Website | url = http://www.spyflight.co.uk/db8.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-18 }}</ref>. A reengined version, Sarigue-NG, went into service in 2000. The name stands for Systeme Aeroporte de Recueil d’Informations de Guerre Electronique (Airborne Electronic Warfare Information Gathering System) and also is the French word for Opossum, a shy and retiring animal. The updated aircraft was known as the SARIGUE-NG, with the NG standing for Nouvelle Generation or New Generation. Both DC-8s had a SIGINT system from Thompson-CSF, and operated in the Baltic, Mediterranean, French Africa, and during Desert Storm and NATO Kosovo operations. It had a distinctive sideways looking airborne radar (SLAR) in a "canoe" under the fuselage, as well as large rectangular antenna arrays at each wingtip. The aircraft was fitted with equipment developed by Thompson-CSF, similar to that installed in the earlirt Transall Gabriels. It is believed that the aircraft operated with a 24 man crew and as well as COMINT and SIGINT duties, it could even intercept mobile phone calls. Operated by the French Air Force on behalf of the armed forces and security services, it was seen in the Baltic, Mediterranean and French Africa, as well as being used in support of coalition operations during the Gulf War and NATO peace keeping operations in Kosovo. On 19 Sep 2004, it was reported that in addition to a 50% cost overrun on an electronics upgrade by Thales, the weight of the new upgrade violated safety limits. The French Defence Minister confirmed the Sarigue would be retired because of ‘high operating costs’. An Airbus replacement for the DC-8 was considered and rejected. ===Germany: Aircraft Platforms=== During NATO operations in Bosnia, Germany operated four SIGINT version of the French-German [[Atlantique]] patrol aircraft.<ref name=Wentz /> Germany has selected a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] platform for SIGINT, the EuroHawk version of the U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Block 20 [[Global Hawk]]. The aircraft is made by [[Northrop Grumman]], with the airborne and ground station equipment from [[EADS]]. As with Global Hawk in the US, EuroHawk is approved to operate, unmanned, in the same airspace as commercial aviation. Five [[EuroHawk]]s have been ordered so far, as a replacement for Germany's aging fleet of [[Breguet Atlantique]]s .<ref>{{Cite web | last = Northrop Grumman | title = Northrop Grumman, EADS Joint Venture Awarded $559 Million to Develop German Euro Hawk |date=February 1, 2007 | url = http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=112873 | id = EuroHawk-NG | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>. ===Israel: Aircraft Platforms=== Israel is reported to have converted at least four Boeing 707 aircraft, codenamed Re'em (Antelope) and based at Lod to an electronic warfare role, two for countermeasures and two or more for SIGINT. An indicator of an ELINT role is the presence of a cheek-antenna array externally similar to the AEELS (Automatic ELINT Emitter Locating System) on the RC-135U/V/W. These aging aircraft are due for replacement, probably by Gulfstream G500 executive jets. The aircraft are known as Re'em (Antelope) and are operated by 134 Tayeset at Lod. Some other IAF 707s are possibly configured for AAR/SIGINT operations. Israel is currently looking for up to 9 dual role aircraft to replace their 707’s and will purchase a number of Gulfstream G500s.<ref name=Spyflight707 /> ===India: Aircraft Platforms=== India appears to have a single 707 ELINT aircraft.<ref name=Spyflight707 /> ===Mexico: Aircraft Platforms=== The [[Mexican Air Force]] has 2 [[Embraer P-99]]s and 1 [[Embraer R-99]]A. The R-99A is an [[Airborne Early Warning & Control]] aircraft (AWACS) equipped with the Erieye airborne radar from Ericsson AB of Sweden. The P-99 is the maritime patrol version of the R-99.It retains many of the [[C3I]] and [[ELINT]] capabilities of the R-99B. ===Russia: Aircraft Platforms=== Russian aircraft with SIGINT capability include the Tupolev Tu-142M-Z "Bear", the Beriev A-50 "Mainstay" (based on the Ilyushin 76 airframe) and the IL-38 "May" maritime patrol aircraft operate from bases in Syria, Al Anad Air Base and Khormaksar International Airport in South Yemen, and San Antonio de Los Banos and Jose Marti airbase in Cuba.<ref name=ScherbakovFAPSI /> ===Saudi Arabia: Aircraft Platforms=== Several 707 derivatives, originally used as KE-3 tankers, are being converted to two models of SIGINT suites by E Systems. Later versions are on the E-6 modification of the Boeing 707, the E-6 used by the US as a [[TACAMO]]command and control aircraft.<ref name=Spyflight707 /> According to the US Department of Defense, the Tactical Airborne Surveillance System and upgrades will be installed on Saudi E-3 and E-6 aircraft. The estimated cost is $350 million<ref>{{Citation | last = DefenseLink | title = Memorandum for Correspondents |date=September 5,
