In this way, the model examines interactions especially biogeophysics (sensible and latent heat, momentum, albedo, emission of long waves) and biogeochemistry (CO<sub>2</sub>) of the land-atmosphere the effect of surface of the land in the climate and composition of the atmosphere. This model has a simplified treatment of the surface flows that reproduce at the very least computational cost the essential characteristics of the important interactions of the land-atmosphere for climatic simulations. As the types of surface vegetated for some species are several, have a standardization of types of covering being enclosed surfaces covered with water as lakes (amongst others); thus the model wheel for each point of independent form, with the same average of the atmospheric interactions. The model functions in a space grating that can vary of a point until global. ==References== * [[Bona]]n, G.B. (1996).

The earthworks created for such a purpose are often called the '''sub-grade''' or '''finished contouring''' (see diagram). ==Transportation== In the case of [[gravel road]]s and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] for certain purposes, grading forms not just the base but the cover and surface of the finished construction, and is often called '''finished grade'''. ==Environmental design== In the [[environmental design]] professions grading is a specifications and construction component in [[landscape design]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[architecture]] projects. It is used for buildings or outdoor amenities regarding [[Foundation (architecture)|foundations and footings]], [[Grade (slope)|slope]] [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] and stabilizing, aesthetic contouring, and directing [[surface runoff]] drainage of [[stormwater]] and domestic/irrigation runoff flows. {{clear}} == See also == * [[Subgrade]] * [[Grader]] (machine) * [[Grade (slope)]] (civil engineering and geographical treatment) * [[Slope]] (mathematical treatment) <br> [[Category:Road infrastructure]] [[Category:Gardening aids]] [[Category:Landscape architecture]] [[Category:Construction]] {{road-stub}} {{rail-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>21114</id> <title>Landline</title> <text>{{For|the ABC TV series|Landline (TV series)}} {{Unreferenced|date=January 2008}} [[Image:Siemens Euroset 805.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A landline telephone]] [[File:Fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007 ITU.png|thumb|Fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007]] A '''landline''' (or '''land line''') was originally an overland [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] wire,<ref>{{cite web| title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications |url=http://atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/NorthernLine/index.htm}}</ref> as opposed to an [[Submarine communications cable|undersea cable]]. Currently, '''landline''' (or '''land phone''' or '''main line''' or '''fixed-line''') refers to a [[telephone line]] which travels through a solid medium, either metal [[wire]] or [[optical fibre]], as distinguished from a [[mobile phone|mobile cellular line]], where transmission is via [[radio waves]]. Landlines usually have a lower price for calling time, and the user hardware costs less than mobile phones, but they are less convenient. A land line is also used to increase the security of communications, as it cannot be intercepted by a receiver without [[wiretapping|physical access]] to the line. (This does not, however, mean that a [[telephone company]] will not send the call over the air on some point in the journey.) In 2003, the [[CIA World Factbook|CIA]] reported approximately 1.263 billion main [[telephone]] lines worldwide. [[China]] had more than any other country, at 350 million, and the [[United States]] was second with 268 million - this compared with 219.4 million cellular telephones, a number which is expected to exceed the landline number within a few years. In 2008 there were 1,270,000,000 fixed line subscribers in the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Measuring the Information Society: The ICT Development Index|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|date=2009|pages=108|isbn=9261128319|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/2009/material/IDI2009_w5.pdf}}</ref> The number of households having a mobile phone but not a landline (Cellphone Only or CPO) reached 18% in the United States and the number of landlines used in developed countries began to decline.<ref>[http://www.examiner.com/x-7097-Philadelphia-Gadgets-Examiner~y2009m4d18-Getting-rid-of-the-landline-telephone Getting rid of the landline telephone] Philadelphia examiner</ref> == Fixed phone == A '''fixed phone''' line (a line that is not a [[mobile phone]] line) can be hard-[[wire]]d or [[wireless]]. Fixed wireless refers to the operation of wireless devices or systems in fixed locations such as homes and offices. Fixed wireless devices usually derive their electrical power from the utility [[mains electricity]], unlike mobile wireless or portable wireless which tend to be [[battery-power]]ed. Although mobile and portable systems can be used in fixed locations, efficiency and bandwidth are compromised compared with fixed systems. Mobile or portable, battery-powered wireless systems can serve as emergency backups for fixed systems in case of a power blackout or natural disaster. The technology for wireless connection to the [[Internet]] is as old as the Net itself. [[Amateur radio]] operators began "patching" into telephone lines with fixed, mobile, and portable two-way voice radios in the middle of the 20th Century. A [[wireless modem]] works something like an amateur-radio "[[Military Affiliate Radio System|phone patch]]," except faster. High-end fixed wireless employs [[broadband modem]]s that bypass the telephone system and offer Internet access hundreds of times faster than twisted-pair hard-wired connections or cell-phone modems. == Dedicated lines == The term '''landline''' is also used to describe a connection between two or more points that consists of a dedicated physical cable, as opposed to an always-available private link that is actually implemented as a circuit in a wider switched system (usually the [[public switched telephone network]]). So-called [[leased line]]s are invariably of the latter type; the implications of a
