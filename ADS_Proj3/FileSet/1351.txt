requires appropriate positioning in the organization. The analogy of city-planning is often invoked in this connection, and is instructive. An intermediate outcome of an architecture process is a comprehensive inventory of business security strategy, business security processes, [[organizational chart]]s, technical security inventories, system and interface diagrams, and network topologies, and the explicit relationships between them. The inventories and diagrams are merely tools that support decision making. But this is not sufficient. It must be a living process. The organization must design and implement a process that ensures continual movement from the current state to the future state. The future state will generally be a combination of one or more * Closing gaps that are present between the current organization strategy and the ability of the IT security dimensions to support it * Closing gaps that are present between the desired future organization strategy and the ability of the security dimensions to support it * Necessary upgrades and replacements that must be made to the IT security architecture based on supplier viability, age and performance of hardware and software, capacity issues, known or anticipated regulatory requirements, and other issues not driven explicitly by the organization's functional management. * On a regular basis, the current state and future state are redefined to account for evolution of the architecture, changes in organizational strategy, and purely external factors such as changes in technology and customer/vendor/government requirements. == High-level security architecture framework == [[Image:Huxham Security Framework.jpg|right|360px]] Enterprise information security architecture frameworks is only a subset of enterprise architecture frameworks. If we had to simplify the [[conceptual]] [[abstraction]] of enterprise information security architecture within a generic framework, the picture on the right would be acceptable as a high-level [[conceptual]] security architecture framework. Other open enterprise architecture frameworks are: * [[DODAF|The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DoDAF)]] * Extended Enterprise Architecture Framework (E2AF) from the Institute For Enterprise Architecture Developments.<ref>[http://www.enterprise-architecture.info Extended Enterprise Architecture Framework].</ref> * [[Federal Enterprise Architecture]] of the United States Government (FEA) * Capgemini's Integrated Architecture Framework<ref>[http://www.capgemini.com/services/soa/ent_architecture/iaf/ Capgemini's Integrated Architecture Framework]</ref> * [[MODAF|The UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) Architecture Framework (MODAF)]] * NIH Enterprise Architecture Framework<ref>[http://enterprisearchitecture.nih.gov/About/Approach/Framework.htm NIH Enterprise Architecture Framework]</ref> * Open Security Architecture<ref>[http://opensecurityarchitecture.org Open Security Architecture]</ref> * Information Assurance Enterprise Architectural Framework (IAEAF) * [[SABSA|SABSA framework and methodology]] * [[Service-Oriented Modeling]] Framework (SOMF) * [[TOGAF|The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)]] * [[Zachman Framework]] == Relationship to other IT disciplines == Enterprise information security architecture is a key component of the [[information security]] technology governance process at any organization of significant size. More and more [[companies]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} are implementing a formal enterprise security architecture process to support the [[governance]] and [[management]] of IT. However, as noted in the opening paragraph of this article it ideally relates more broadly to the practice of business optimization in that it addresses business security architecture, performance management and process security architecture as well. Enterprise Information Security Architecture is also related to IT security portfolio management and [[metadata]] in the enterprise IT sense. == See also == * [[Enterprise architecture]] * [[Enterprise architecture planning]] * [[Information security]] * [[Information assurance]] == References == {{reflist}} == Further reading == * Carbone, J.

As data is combined from multiple sources, it can be given a new structure or context that will help users find what they need regardless of where it came from. The primary goal is to turn large amounts of manufacturing data into real knowledge and drive business results based on that knowledge. == History of EMI == The term EMI was first applied to the Lighthammer "Illuminator" product in 2001. Lighthammer was one of the early pioneers in the area of Manufacturing Intelligence and Integration (and, in fact, the eponymous product [[SAP AG|SAP]] MII is the outgrowth of SAP's acquisition of Lighthammer in 2005). Other innovators in the area include [http://www.aegiscorp.com Aegis Analytical Corporation] with its Discoverant software suite, Indx Software (now part of Siemens), [[AspenTech]] a leader in Process Industry Performance Management Solutions. Traditional plant floor automation vendors were later entrants into the market, including [[OSIsoft]], GEFanuc/Intellution, [[Rockwell Automation]], [[Invensys]] Wonderware. At one point, both GEFanuc and Rockwell were OEM's of the Lighthammer technology, but each later created or acquired its own solution. Invensys (Wonderware) has recently introduced an EMI product called Wonderware Intelligence. Additional pure-play EMI vendors include Informance, ActivPlant (formerly EMT, later acquired by CDC Software), Incuity (later acquired by Rockwell Automation), Manuvis, Zarpac Performance Index, and others. {{reflist}} == Core Functions of EMI == [[AMR Research]] has identified five core functions every Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence application should possess: * '''Aggregation:''' Making available data from many sources, most often databases. * '''Contextualization:''' Providing a structure, or model, for the data that will help users find what they need. Usually a folder tree utilizing a hierarchy such as the [[ISA-95]] standard. * '''Analysis:'''
