with netCDF-4.0. The Parallel-NetCDF package uses different, but similar APIs in Fortran and C. Parallel I/O in the Unidata netCDF library has been supported since release 4.0, for HDF5 data files. Since version 4.1.1 the Unidata NetCDF C library supports parallel I/O to classic and 64-bit offset files using the Parallel-NetCDF library, but with the NetCDF API. ==Interoperability of C/Fortran/C++ Libraries with Other Formats== The netCDF C library, and the libraries based on it (Fortran 77 and Fortran 90, C++, and all third-party libraries) can, starting with version 4.1.1, read some data in other data formats. Data in the [[HDF5]] format can be read, with some restrictions. Data in the [[HDF4]] format can be read by the netCDF C library if created using the HDF4 Scientific Data (SD) API. ==NetCDF-Java Common Data Model== The NetCDF-Java library currently reads the following file formats and remote access protocols: * [[BUFR]] Format Documentation<ref>[[BUFR]] [http://dss.ucar.edu/docs/formats/bufr/ Format Documentation]</ref> (ongoing development) * CINRAD level II<ref>[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/v2.2.20/javadocAll/ucar/nc2/iosp/cinrad/package-summary.html CINRAD level II]</ref> (Chinese Radar format) * DMSP<ref>[http://dmsp.ngdc.noaa.gov/ DMSP] ([[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]])</ref> ([[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]]) * DORADE<ref>[http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rsf/UserGuides/ELDORA/DataAnalysis/DataAnalysis.html#DORADE DORADE] radar file format</ref> radar file format * GINI<ref>[http://weather.unisys.com/wxp/Appendices/Formats/GINI.html GINI] ([[GOES]] Ingest and [[NOAA]]PORT Interface) image format</ref> ([[GOES]] Ingest and [[NOAA]]PORT Interface) image format * GEMPAK<ref>[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/gempak/ GEMPAK] gridded data</ref> gridded data * [[GRIB]] version 1 and version 2 (ongoing work on tables) * GTOPO<ref>[http://edc.usgs.gov/products/elevation/gtopo30/gtopo30.html GTOPO] 30-sec elevation dataset ([[USGS]])</ref> 30-sec elevation dataset ([[USGS]]) * [[Hierarchical Data Format]] (HDF4, HDF-EOS, HDF5, HDF5-EOS) * NetCDF<ref>[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/index.html NetCDF]</ref> (classic and large format) * NetCDF-4<ref>[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/ NetCDF-4]</ref> (built on [[HDF5]]) * NEXRAD Radar<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/radar/radarresources.html NEXRAD Radar] level 2 and level 3.</ref> level 2 and level 3. There are a number of other formats in development. Since each of these is accessed transparently through the NetCDF API, the NetCDF-Java library is said to implement a ''Common Data Model'' for scientific datasets. The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics: # The ''data access'' layer, also known as the syntactic layer, handles data reading. # The ''coordinate system'' layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general concept for scientific data; specialized [[Georeference|georeferencing]] coordinate systems, important to the Earth Science community, are specially annotated. # The ''scientific data type'' layer identifies specific types of data, such as grids, images, and point data, and adds specialized methods for each kind of data. The [[Data model]] of the data access layer is a generalization of the NetCDF-3 data model, and substantially the same as the NetCDF-4 data model. The coordinate system layer implements and extends the concepts in the [[Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions]]. The scientific data type layer allows data to be manipulated in coordinate space, analogous to the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] specifications. The identification of coordinate systems and data typing is ongoing, but users can plug in their own classes at runtime for specialized processing. ==See also== * [[Common Data Format]] (CDF) * [[CGNS]] ([[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] General Notation System) * [[EAS3]] (Ein-Ausgabe-System) * [[FITS]] (Flexible Image Transport System) * [[GRIB]] (GRIdded Binary) * [[Hierarchical Data Format]] (HDF) <!-- * [[NetCDF]] (Network Common Data Form) --> * [[OPeNDAP]] client-server protocols * [[Tecplot]] binary files * [[XMDF]] (eXtensible Model Data Format) ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ netCDF project] at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) * [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/ netCDF-Java project] at UCAR * [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/index.html netCDF4 project] at UCAR * [http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/ ncBrowse] - generic netCDF file viewer - includes Java graphics, animations and 3D visualizations for wide range of netCDF file conventions * [http://www.xi-advies.nl/downloads/AnIntroductionToDistributedVisualization.pdf "An Introduction to Distributed Visualization"]; section 4.2 contains a comparison of CDF, HDF, and netCDF. * [http://nco.sourceforge.net NCO], a suite of programs known as operators, which facilitate manipulation and analysis of netCDF files * [http://www.epic.noaa.gov/epic/software/dapper/ dapper] data server and [http://www.epic.noaa.gov/epic/software/dchart/ DChart] web client for [[OPeNDAP]] in-situ data in netCDF format * [http://www.crwr.utexas.edu/gis/gishydro06/SpaceAndTime/NetCDF/Animating%20netCDF%20Data%20in%20ArcMap.htm Animating NetCDF Data in ArcMap] * [http://ncwms.sf.net ncWMS], a [[Web Map Service]] and dynamic web application for visualizing NetCDF data ([http://www.reading.ac.uk/godiva2 demo site]) * [http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents CF Conventions documents] * [http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ CF home page] * [http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/other/cf_overview_article.pdf Overview of CF] * [http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects-and-groups-adopting-the-cf-conventions-as-their-standard Projects and Groups using CF (partial)] * [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/software.html List of software utilities using netCDF files] {{FOLDOC}} [[Category:Meteorological data and networks]] [[Category:Computer file formats]] [[Category:Earth sciences graphics software]] [[Category:Earth sciences data formats]] [[de:NetCDF]] [[fr:NetCDF]] [[pl:NetCDF]] [[ru:NetCDF]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26089</id> <title>NetCrunch</title> <text>{{ infobox software | logo = [[File:adrem_logo.png]] | developer = AdRem Software, Inc. | genre = [[Network management system]] | license = Commercial | website = http://www.adremsoft.com/netcrunch }} [[AdRem_Software|AdRem]] '''NetCrunch''' is a commercial software solution for agentless, cross-platform [[network monitoring]] developed by [[AdRem_Software|AdRem Software, Inc.]] The program monitors 65 [[network service]]s, Windows applications; [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[NetWare]], [[BSD]], [[Mac OS X]] systems and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] (v1-3) devices without agents; centralizes [[fault management]] by collecting and alerting on events from sources including Windows Event Log, [[syslog]]s, and SNMP traps; presents physical and logical [[network topology]] as automatically updated dynamic graphical views.
