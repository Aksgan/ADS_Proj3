For a generally accessible introduction to quantum mechanics, see [[Introduction to quantum mechanics]].}} {{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}} '''Quantum pseudo-telepathy''' is a [[phenomenon]] in [[quantum game theory]] resulting in anomalously high success rates in [[coordination game]]s between separated players. These high success rates would seem to require communication between the players; however, the game is set up such that during the game, this is physically impossible. Quantum pseudo-telepathy is often and easily misrepresented as [[paranormal]]<ref>http://www.science20.com/hammock_physicist/telepathy_and_quantum_0</ref>, given that most people are not aware of the fact that the quantum laws of physics are subtly [[Nonlocality|non-local]] and allow violations of [[Bell's theorem|Bell inequalities]]. This means that for quantum pseudo-telepathy to occur, prior to the game the participants need to share a physical system in an [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum state]], and during the game have to execute [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurements on this entangled state]] as part of their game strategy. Games in which the application of such a quantum strategy leads to pseudo-telepathy are also referred to as quantum non-locality games. In their 1999 paper,<ref name="Brassard 1999">Gilles Brassard, Richard Cleve, Alain Tapp, "[http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9901035 The cost of exactly simulating quantum entanglement with classical communication]" (1999).</ref> [[Gilles Brassard]], [[Richard Cleve]] and Alain Tapp demonstrated that winning quantum strategies can exist in simple games for which in the absence of quantum entanglement a winning strategy can result only if the participants were allowed to communicate. The term quantum pseudo-telepathy was later introduced<ref name="Brassard 2003"> Gilles Brassard, Anne Broadbent, Alain Tapp, "[http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0306042 Multi-Party Pseudo-Telepathy]" (2003).</ref> for this phenomenon. The prefix 'pseudo' is appropriate, as the quantum non-locality effects that are at the heart of the phenomenon do not allow any transfer of information, but rather eliminate the need to exchange information between the players for achieving a mutual win in the game. The phenomenon of quantum pseudo-telepathy is mostly used as a powerful and explicit [[thought experiment]] of the non-local characteristics of [[quantum mechanics]]. Yet, the effect is real and subject to experimental verification, as demonstrated by the [[Bell test experiments|experimental confirmation]] of the violation of the Bell inequalities. ==The Mermin-Peres magic square game== [[Image:Mermin-Peres magic square.png|thumb|When attempting to construct a 3x3 table filled with the numbers +1 and -1, such that each row has an even number and each column an odd number of negative entries, a conflict is bound to emerge.]] An example of quantum pseudo-telepathy can be observed in the following two-player coordination game in which the participants fill one row and one column of a 3x3 table with plus and minus signs. The two players [[Alice and Bob]] are separated so that no communication between them is possible. In each round of the game Alice gets informed which row is selected, and Bob is being told which column is selected. Alice does not get to know the column Bob has been presented with, and vice versa (Bob remains unaware of the row presented to Alice). Alice and Bob both have to put the same sign in the cell common to the row and column selected. Furthermore (and this is the catch), Alice has to fill the remainder of the row such that there is an even number of – signs in that row, whilst Bob has to fill the remainder of the column such that there is an odd number of – signs in that column. It is easy to see that any prior agreement between Alice and Bob on the use of specific tables filled with + and – signs is not going to help them. The reason being that such tables simply do not exist: as these would be self-contradictory with the sum of the minus signs in the table being even based on row sums, and being odd when using column sums. So, how can Alice and Bob succeed in their task? The trick is for Alice and Bob to share an entangled quantum state and to use specific measurements on their components of the entangled state to derive the table entries. A suitable correlated state consists of a pair of [[Bell state]]s: :<math> \left|\phi\right\rang = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(\left|+\right\rang_a \otimes \left|+\right\rang_b + \left|-\right\rang_a \otimes \left|-\right\rang_b \bigg) \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(\left|+\right\rang_a \otimes \left|+\right\rang_b + \left|-\right\rang_a \otimes \left|-\right\rang_b \bigg) </math> here |+> and |-> are [[eigenstate]]s of the Pauli operator ''S''<sub>''z''</sub> with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively, whilst the subscripts a and b denote which component of each Bell state is going to Alice and which one goes to Bob. Observables for these components can be written as products of the [[Pauli matrices|Pauli spin matrices]]: :<math> S_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} , S_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} , S_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} </math> Products of these Pauli spin operators can be used to fill the 3x3 table such that each row and each column contains a mutually [[Commutativity|commuting]] set of observables with eigenvalues +1 and -1, and with the product of the obervables in each row being the identity operator, and the product of observables in each column equating to minus the identity operator.
