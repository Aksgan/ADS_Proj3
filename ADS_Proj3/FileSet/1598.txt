If the program fails (for example, by [[Crash (computing)|crashing]] or failing built-in code [[assertion (computing)|assertion]]s), the defects can be noted. The term Fuzz originated from a class project topic in Prof. Barton Miller's graduate Advanced Operating System class at the University of Wisconsin in the Fall of 1988. The assignment was titled "Operating System Utility Program Reliability - The Fuzz Generator".<ref>Barton Miller (2008). "Preface". In Ari Takanen, Jared DeMott and Charlie Miller, ''Fuzzing for Software Security Testing and Quality Assurance'', ISBN 978-1-59693-214-2</ref> In quality assurance and testing, the same approach (using unexpected data or syntax) has been called [[robustness testing]], [[syntax testing]] or [[negative testing]]. Even [[white-noise testing]] can be thought of as fuzzing. [[File format]]s and [[Protocol (computing)|network protocols]] are the most common targets of fuzz testing, but any type of program input can be fuzzed. Interesting inputs include [[environment variable]]s, keyboard and mouse [[event (computing)|event]]s, and sequences of [[application programming interface|API]] calls. Even items not normally considered "input" can be fuzzed, such as the contents of [[database]]s, [[shared memory]], or the precise interleaving of [[thread (computer science)|thread]]s. For the purpose of security, input that crosses a [[trust boundary]] is often the most interesting.<ref>{{cite web | author=John Neystadt | title=Automated Penetration Testing with White-Box Fuzzing | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc162782.aspx | publisher=Microsoft | date=2008-02 | accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> For example, it is more important to fuzz code that handles the upload of a file by any user than it is to fuzz the code that parses a configuration file that is accessible only to a
