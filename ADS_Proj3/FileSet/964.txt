The Bankash.G Trojan, for example, exploited an [[Internet Explorer]] vulnerability to steal passwords, monitor user input on webmail and online commerce sites. <ref name="Symantec"/> * [[Targeted attacks]] sent via [[SMTP]]. These social-engineered threats often arrive disguised as a valid e-mail messages and include specific company information and sender addresses.

One survey estimates that organizations, in 2005, lost in excess of $30 million due to the theft of proprietary information.<ref>CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey 2005, p.15</ref> Additionally, for businesses, the theft of financial or confidential information from corporate networks often places the organizations in violation of government and industry-imposed regulatory requirements that attempt to ensure that financial, personal, and confidential information is not altered or stolen by criminals.

They are tools of verification. Understanding a [[philosophy]]'s criteria of [[truth]] is fundamental to a clear evaluation of that philosophy. This necessity is driven by the varying, and conflicting, claims of different philosophies. The rules of [[logic]] have no ability to distinguish truth on their own. An individual must determine what standards distinguish truth from [[Falsity|falsehood]]. Not all criteria are equally valid. Some standards are sufficient, while others are questionable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=William| coauthors=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|year=1993|title= Ideas of the Great Philosophers|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=1-56619-271-4|pages=3&ndash;4}}</ref> ==Primary truths== There are three "primary truths" inherently accepted in the investigation of knowledge and truth. They are the first fact (the fact of our existence), the first principle (the principle of non-contradiction) and the first condition (the ability of the mind to know truth). They cannot be validated with positive proof, as they are an inherent in every analysis. As a demonstration of their a priori nature, a person objecting to these essential truths cannot set a standard of proof without implicitly accepting the premises.<ref name="dolhenty">{{cite web |url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/epistom.htm |title=Part Thirteen:The Criterion of Truth |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Dolhenty |first=Jonathan |work= The Problem of Knowledge: A brief introduction to epistemology}}</ref> ==Validity== Truth can only be attributed to judgments, which are expressed as propositions that note the degree, or lack, of agreement between two or more ideas. Arguments are made up of propositions. Arguments are never "true" or "false." The propositions making up the argument may be "true" or "false," but not the argument itself. An argument is either "valid" or "invalid." Every deductive argument is either valid or invalid. The conclusion may be true but invalid, but it is also possible for a conclusion to be false but valid. Truth is the agreement of a premise or judgment with reality. Contrastingly, validity is the adherence to rules of logic in the relationship between premises and conclusions. Only propositions are true or false, while deductive arguments are valid or invalid. Inductive arguments are neither valid nor invalid, but rather judged as having a certain probability.<ref name="dolhenty"/> ==Evidence of certainty== Some truths (very few) are self-evident. They are immediately obvious, such as the three primary truths. However, truth is not usually self-apparent and must be proven through the medium of rational analysis. For example, the boiling point of water must be discovered and tested. The authority of scientists who performed such an experiment is usually accepted, but if they are doubted, the experiment can be recreated and the evidence of truth confirmed. To be of rational value, evidence must be objective. Jonathan Dolhenty posits that there are three possible sources of objective evidence: the evidence of the senses, the evidence of rational thought and the evidence of expert testimony. Dolhenty expresses the need for caution with expert accounts, stating that there must be a willingness to challenge authority. He points out that experts have made errors, and even falsified evidence, on occasion.<ref name="dolhenty"/> ==Tests== The tests, or criteria, of truth listed represent those most commonly used by scholars and the general public.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pg. 3.</ref> Jonathan Dolhenty states there seem to be only three tests of "truth",
