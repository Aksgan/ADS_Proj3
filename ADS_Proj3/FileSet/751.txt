proof for this came from a series of experiments involving rats in a maze performed by Tolman in the 1940s: # It seems the rats explore the maze for no other reason than for the fun of it.<ref>Richard D Gross: Psychology Science of mind and behavior p 186</ref> # If they know the maze well they will find their way even if the maze is filled with water and the rats are forced to swim in order to find their way to food. Tolman's is more complex than learning theory, which is based on reward and punishment as motivators. Behaviorists like Watson & Pavlov <ref>http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/beh.html</ref> would see the nervous system as rather simple, and according to them learning is formed by reward and punishment. Metaphorically the brain is like a simple switchboard. [[Albert Bandura]] and G.H. Mead would add that imitating others (having role models) is also a motivator for learning. Tolman is talking about cognitive behaviorism, which is an important part of cognitive therapy today.<ref>R.D. Gross p 190-200</ref> The rats in the maze seem to learn even if they are not rewarded for it, and they also remember what they learn. This is a school of thought nowadays known as field theory. This group believes that in the course of learning something like a field map of the environment gets established in the rat's (or person's) brain. You could argue that the rat in running a maze is exposed to stimuli and is finally led as a result of these stimuli to the responses which actually occur. However the intervening brain processes are more complicated, more patterned and often, pragmatically speaking, more autonomous than do the stimulus-response psychologists. Although it's most likely that the rat is bombarded by stimuli, it's very likely that the nervous system is surprisingly selective as to which of these stimuli it will let in at any given time. Learning gives us a better chance to evaluate the future and survive <ref>Gross p 180-200</ref><ref>[http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/bandura.html Albert Bandura]</ref> The maps in the brain cannot be seen; we can only see the consequences of learning. The brain makes connections far more complex than those possible to see in a microscope or a scanner. [[Reductionism]] and [[Occams razor]] are excellent topics to read about if you want to learn more about how brain and learning relate to each other. It's a known fact that the human brain becomes more complex and interrelates in new ways during childhood and adolescence. The "central office" (the Brain) itself is far more like a map control room than it is like an old-fashioned telephone exchange. The stimuli, which are allowed in, are not connected by just simple one-to-one switches to the outgoing responses. Rather, the incoming impulses are usually worked over and elaborated in the central control room into a tentative, cognitive-like map of the environment. And it is this tentative map, indicating routes and paths and environmental relationships, which finally determines what responses, if any, the animal will finally release. [p. 193] [[Image:Africaoutlineupsidedown.jpg‎|thumb|Does this map look familiar?]] The map here is known to most people. However, it is upside down. Rotate the picture in your mind (or stand on your head) and you will see Africa. Now where is the Republic of South Africa? You know the map and you can use that knowledge. You just rotate the map in your mind and there you have it. Attempting to teach such a concept to an animal would prove difficult. If you reorganize knowledge and learn a lot from it, it is [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt learning]] or an ''Aha'' moment ([[Aha-Erlebnis]]). Sometimes you have to combine knowledge in new ways. Finally, it is also important to note how these maps are relatively narrow and strip-like, or broad and comprehensive. Both strip-maps and comprehensive-maps may be either correct or incorrect in the sense that they may, when acted upon, lead successfully to the animal's goal. The differences between such strip maps and such comprehensive maps will appear only when the rat is later presented with some change within the given environment. Then, the narrower and more strip-like the original map, the less will it carry over successfully to the new problem; whereas, the wider and the more comprehensive it was, the more adequately it will serve in the new set-up. In a strip-map the given position of the animal is connected by only a relatively simple and single path to the position of the goal. In a comprehensive-map a wider arc of the environment is represented, so that, if the starting position of the animal be changed or variations in the specific routes be introduced, this wider map will allow the animal still to behave relatively correctly and to choose the appropriate new route. ==See also== * [[Cognition]] * [[Fuzzy cognitive map]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Cognitive Map}} [[Category:Mnemonics]] [[Category:Knowledge representation]] [[ar:خريطة الإدراك]] [[cs:Kognitivní mapy]] [[de:Kognitive Karte]] [[pt:Mapa cognitivo]] [[ru:Когнитивная карта]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6767</id> <title>Cognitive password</title> <text>A '''cognitive password''' is a form of [[Authentication|knowledge-based authentication]] that requires a user to answer a question, presumably something they intrinsically know, to verify their identity.

Cognitive passwords were developed to overcome the common memorability vs. [[Password strength|strength]] problem that exists with the traditional password. Cognitive passwords, when compared to other password systems, can be measured through the usage of a memorability vs. guessability ratio.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Shon |title=Mike Meyers' CISSP(R) Certification Passport|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2002|edition=illustrated|series=Mike Meyers' certification passport Passport Series|pages=36|chapter=2|isbn=9780072225785|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vp3MEDK0E7sC}}</ref> ==History== Research on passwords as an authentification method has struggled between memorability and strong security <ref name="zh1990a724">(Zviran and Haga, 1990a, p. 724)</ref>.
