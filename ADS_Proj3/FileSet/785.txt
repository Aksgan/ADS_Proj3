together), or a data-access locking related voting deadlock, both implying a global cycle in the global augmented conflict graph and missing votes, the atomic commitment protocol breaks such cycle by aborting an undecided transaction on it (see [[commitment ordering#The distributed CO algorithm|The distributed CO algorithm]] above). Differences between the various variants exist at the local level only (within the participating database systems). Each local CO instance of any variant has the same role, to determine the position of every global transaction (a transaction that spans two or more databases) within the local commitment order, i.e., to determine when it is the transaction's turn to be voted on locally in the atomic commitment protocol. Thus, all the CO variants exhibit the same behavior in regard to atomic commitment. This means that they are all interoperable via atomic commitment (using the same software [[interface (computer science)|interfaces]], typically provided as [[Service (systems architecture)|service]]s, some already [[international standard|standardized]] for atomic commitment, primarily for the [[two phase commit]] protocol, e.g., [[X/Open XA]]) and transparently can be utilized together in any distributed environment (while each CO variant instance is possibly associated with any relevant local concurrency control mechanism type). In summary, any single global transaction can participate simultaneously in databases that may employ each any, possibly different, CO variant (while concurrently running processes in each such database, and running concurrently with local and other global transactions in each such database). The atomic commitment protocol is indifferent to CO, and does not distinguish between the various CO variants. Any ''global cycle'' generated in the augmented global conflict graph may span databases of different CO variants, and generate (if not broken by any local abort) a voting deadlock that is resolved by atomic commitment exactly the same way as in a single CO variant environment. ''local cycles'' (now possibly with mixed materialized and non-materialized conflicts, both serializability and data-access-locking deadlock related, e.g., SCO) are resolved locally (each by its respective variant instance's own local mechanisms). Combining results for CO and its variants the following is concluded: *'''The CO Variants Interoperability Theorem''' #In a multi-database environment, where each database system (transactional object) is compliant with some CO variant property, any global transaction can participate simultaneously in databases of possibly different CO variants, and Global serializability is guaranteed (''sufficient condition'' for Global serializability; and Global one-copy-serializability (1SER), for a case when a multi-version database exists). #If only local (to a database system) concurrency control information is utilized by every database system (each has the ''generalized autonomy'' property, a generalization of ''autonomy''), then compliance of each with some (any) CO variant property is a ''necessary condition'' for guaranteeing Global serializability (and Global 1SER; otherwise they may be violated). #Furthermore, in such environment data-access-locking related global deadlocks are resolved automatically (each such deadlock is generated by a global cycle in the ''augmented conflict graph'' (i.e., a ''voting deadlock''; see above), involving at least one data-access lock (non-materialized conflict) and two database systems; thus, not a cycle in the regular conflict graph and does not affect serializability). ==See also== *[[Serializability]] - where background information needed for CO and terminology are provided. *[[Global serializability]] - where the ''Global serializability problem'' and its proposed solutions are presented. *[[The History of Commitment Ordering]] * CO US patents ([[#Raz1991a|Raz 1991a]]); see also ([[#Raz1990|Raz 1990]]) ==References== *<cite id=Raz1992>[[Yoav Raz]] (1992): [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/vldb/Raz92.html "The Principle of Commitment Ordering, or Guaranteeing Serializability in a Heterogeneous Environment of Multiple Autonomous Resource Managers Using Atomic Commitment."] ''Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Very Large Data Bases'' (VLDB), pp. 292-312, Vancouver, Canada, August 1992.
