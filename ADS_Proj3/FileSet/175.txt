securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. The [[Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and presented by the committee, was slightly revised and unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4, marking the formation of a new nation, which called itself the [[United States of America]].<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'' (1997) pp. 41-46</ref> The Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution, the "Articles of Confederation," for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777, and immediately began operating under their terms. The Articles were formally ratified on March 1, 1781. At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and on the following day a new government of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]] took its place, with [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] as presiding officer.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 30</ref><ref>Klos, ''President Who?

The British, however, were massing forces at their naval base at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. They returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating Washington's Continental Army at the [[Battle of Brooklyn]] in August, one of the largest engagements of the war. After the Battle of Brooklyn, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities. A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met Howe on [[Staten Island]] in New York Harbor on September 11, in what became known as the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]]. Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended until 1781. The British then [[Battle of Kip's Bay|quickly seized New York City]] and nearly captured General Washington. They made the city their main political and military base of operations in North America, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|holding it until November 1783]]. New York City consequently became the destination for Loyalist refugees, and a focal point of Washington's [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]].<ref>Schecter, Barnet.

(2002)</ref><ref>McCullough, ''1776'' (2005)</ref> The British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania, but in a surprise attack in late December 1776 Washington [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|crossed the Delaware River]] back into New Jersey and defeated Hessian and British armies at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], thereby regaining New Jersey. The victories gave an important boost to pro-independence supporters at a time when morale was flagging, and have become iconic events of the war.[[File:Washington Praying 1928 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|185px|Washington at Valley Forge, issue of 1928]] In 1777, as part of a grand strategy to end the war, the British sent an invasion force from Canada to seal off New England, which the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. In a major case of mis-coordination, the British army in New York City went to Philadelphia which it captured from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] waited in vain for reinforcements from New York, and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15 a pivotal [[siege]] at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania distracted British troops and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]]. ===American alliances after 1778=== {{See|France in the American Revolutionary War|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}} The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress, as Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] were signed between the United States and France.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28">Hamilton, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'' (1974) p. 28</ref> [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America, and unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had previously sympathised with colonial grievances now turned against the American rebels for allying with British international rival and enemy.<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) p. 151</ref> Later Spain (in 1779) and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] (1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one front in Britain's war.<ref>Mackesy, ''The War for America'' (1993) p. 568</ref> The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean colonies, which were considered more valuable. Because of the alliance with France and the deteriorating military situation, [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], the British commander, evacuated Philadelphia to reinforce New York City. General Washington attempted to intercept the retreating column, resulting in the [[Battle of Monmouth|Battle of Monmouth Court House]], the last major battle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British successfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became a stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater.<ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83">Higginbotham, ''The War of American Independence'' (1983) p. 83</ref> ===The British move South, 1778–1783=== {{See|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War}} The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern colonies. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders saw the "southern strategy" as a more viable plan,
