Its Program Director is [[Nick McKeown]]. ==Outline== It is based on the belief that the current Internet has significant deficiencies that need to be solved before it can become a unified global communication infrastructure, and that the Internet's shortcomings will not be resolved by the conventional incremental and backward-compatible style of academic and industrial networking research. The program aims to focus on unconventional, bold, and long-term research that tries to break the network's ossification. To this end, the research program is characterized by two research questions: * "With what we know today, if we were to start again with a clean slate, how would we design a global communications infrastructure", and * "How should the Internet look in 15 years." They aim to measure success in the long-term: looking back in 15 years time to see significant impact. They identify five key areas for research: # Network architecture # Heterogeneous applications # Heterogeneous physical layer technologies # Security # Economics & policy and expect these areas will evolve and perhaps change completely as the program progresses.<ref>[http://cleanslate.stanford.edu/ Clean Slate website at Stanford]</ref> ==Notes and references== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.TropicalCoder.com/BrokenInternet.htm A discussion of the social and political implications of Stanford's Clean Slate program, with many links to background material and on-line articles] [[Category:Internet]] [[Category:Internet architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6425</id> <title>Clean room design</title> <text>{{about||the manufacturing process setting, used for example in [[integrated circuit]] manufacture|Clean room|the meaning of '''Clean room engineering''' in software development|Cleanroom Software Engineering}} '''Clean room design''' (also known as the [[Chinese wall#Computer science|Chinese wall]] technique) is the method of copying a design by [[reverse engineering]] and then recreating it without infringing any of the [[copyright]]s and [[trade secret]]s associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright and trade secret infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against [[patent]]s, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. The term implies that the design team works in an environment that is 'clean', or demonstrably uncontaminated by any knowledge of the proprietary techniques used by the competitor. Typically, a clean room design is done by having someone examine the system to be reimplemented and having this person write a specification. This specification is then reviewed by a lawyer to ensure that no copyrighted material is included. The specification is then implemented by a team with no connection to the original examiners. ==Examples== A famous example is that of [[Columbia Data Products]] who built the first [[IBM PC compatible|clone of an IBM computer]] through a clean room implementation of its [[BIOS]]. Another is [[VTech]]'s successful clones of the [[Apple II]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]]s for the [[Laser 128]], the only computer model, among dozens of Apple II compatibles, which survived [[litigation]] brought by [[Apple Computer]]. [[ReactOS]] is an [[GNU General Public License|open source]] operating system made from clean room reverse engineered components of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. ==Case law== ''[[Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corporation]]'' was a 1999 lawsuit which established an important [[precedent]] in regard to reverse engineering. [[Sony]] sought damages for [[copyright infringement]] over [[Connectix]]'s [[Virtual Game Station]] emulator, alleging that its proprietary BIOS code had been copied into Connectix's product without permission. Sony won the initial judgment, but the ruling was overturned on appeal. Sony eventually purchased the rights to Virtual Game Station to prevent its further sale and development. This established a precedent addressing the legal implications of commercial reverse engineering efforts. During production, Connectix unsuccessfully attempted a [[Chinese wall#Computer science|Chinese wall]] approach to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] the BIOS, so its engineers [[disassembler|disassembled]] the [[object code]] directly. Connectix's successful appeal maintained that the direct disassembly and observation of proprietary code was necessary because there was no other way to determine its behavior. From the ruling: <blockquote> Some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others. Sony's BIOS lay at a distance from the core because it contains unprotected aspects that cannot be examined without copying. The court of appeal therefore accorded it a lower degree of protection than more traditional literary works.</blockquote> ==See also== *[[Chinese wall#Computer science|Chinese wall]] *[[Code morphing]] ==References== {{refbegin}} *{{Cite court |litigants = Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v.
