Kernighan]] and [[P. J. Plauger]], is a study of [[programming style]], advocating the notion that computer programs should be written not only to satisfy the compiler, but also with human readers in mind (especially [[software maintenance]] engineers). The book pays explicit homage, in title and tone, to ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', by [[William Strunk Jr.|Strunk]] & [[E. B. White|White]]. The book is built on short examples from actual, published programs in programming textbooks. Its advice is therefore delivered not in an academic or pedagogical vacuum, but rather in the context of examples which are believable and realistic, sometimes uncomfortably so. The style is diplomatic and generally sympathetic in its criticism, and unabashedly honest as well&mdash; some of the examples with which it finds fault are from the authors' own work (one example in the second edition is from the first edition). Its lessons are summarized at the end of each section in pithy maxims, such as "Let the machine do the dirty work." Modern readers may find it a shortcoming that its examples use older [[procedural programming languages]] ([[Fortran]] and [[PL/I]]) which are quite different from those popular today. (Few of today's popular languages had been invented when this book was written.) However, many of the book's points that generally concern stylistic and structural issues that transcend the idiosyncrasies of particular languages. ==References== *B. W. Kernighan and P. J.

D. Hamilton]] {{Harv|Axelrod|Hamilton|1981}} in the scientific literature, or * a 1984 book by Axelrod {{Harv|Axelrod|1984}}<ref>Axelrod's book was summarized in Douglas Hofstadter's May 1983 "Metamagical Themas" column in Scientific American {{Harv|Hofstadter|1983}} (reprinted in his book {{Harv|Hofstadter|1985}}; see also Richard Dawkin's summary in the second edition of ''The Selfish Gene'' ({{Harv|Dawkins|1989}}, ch. 12.)</ref> that expanded on the paper and popularized the study. This article is an introduction to how [[game theory]] and computer modeling are illuminating certain aspects of [[ethics|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], particularly the role of individuals in groups, the "biology of selfishness and [[altruism]]",<ref name="Dawkins 1989">{{Harvnb|Dawkins|1989}}.</ref> and how [[cooperation]] can be evolutionarily advantageous. == Operations Research == The idea that human behavior can be usefully analyzed mathematically gained great credibility following the application of [[operations research]] in World War II to improve military operations. One famous example involved how the Royal Air Force hunted submarines in the Bay of Biscay.<ref> {{Harvs|nb|last=Morse|last2=Kimball|year1=1951|year2=1956}} </ref> It had seemed to make sense to patrol the areas where submarines were most frequently seen. Then it was pointed out that "seeing the most submarines" was also a function of patrol density – i.e., of the number of eyes looking. Making an allowance for patrol density showed that patrols were more ''efficient'' – that is, found more submarines per patrol – in other areas. Making appropriate adjustments increased the overall effectiveness. == Game Theory == Accounts of the success of operations research during the war, publication in 1944 of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]'s ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' {{Harv|Von Neumann|Morgenstern|1944}} on the use of [[game theory]] for developing and analyzing optimal strategies for military and other uses, and publication of John William's ''The Compleat Strategyst'', a popular exposition of game theory,<ref> {{Harvs|nb|last=Williams|year1=1954|year2=1966}} </ref> led to a greater appreciation of mathematical analysis of human behavior.<ref> See {{Harvtxt|Poundstone|1991}} for a good overview of the development of game theory. </ref> But game theory had a little crisis: it could not find a strategy for a simple game called "[[Prisoner's dilemma|The Prisoner's Dilemma]]" (PD) where two players have the option to cooperate together for mutual gain, but each also takes a risk of being suckered. == Prisoner's Dilemma == The [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] game<ref> Technically, the Prisoner's Dilemma is any two-person "game" where the payoffs are ranked in a certain way. If the payoff ("reward") for mutual cooperation is R, for mutual defection is P, the sucker gets only S, and the temptation payoff (provided the other player is suckered into cooperating) is T, then the payoffs need to be ordered T > R > P > S, and satisfy R > (T+S)/2.
