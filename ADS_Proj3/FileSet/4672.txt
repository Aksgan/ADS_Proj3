Virtual Edge and Anatomy Pathways. In addition to paid content, the VH Dissector includes access to free online lessons including the Clinical Relevance Library, a collection of short lessons describing common procedures and conditions with an emphasis on underlying anatomy. The VH Dissector is currently being used at a number of allopathic<ref name="fogg2007"/> and osteopathic medical schools, nursing programs, physicians assistant programs, as well as being used for undergraduate and K-12 anatomy and biology instruction. ==References== {{reflist|colwidth=30em|refs= <ref name ="fogg2007">{{cite journal |author=Fogg, Quentin A. |title=The Virtual Human Dissector |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=20 |pages=226â€“227 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/ca.20433}}</ref> }} ==External Links== *[http://www.toltech.net Touch of Life Technologies] [[Category:Anatomical simulation]] [[Category:Educational software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39123</id> <title>VICE</title> <text>{{otheruses|Vice (disambiguation)}} {{Infobox Software | name = VICE | logo = [[Image:VICE.png|48px]] | screenshot = [[Image:Vice-c64.png|250px]] | caption = VICE emulating Commodore 64 | collapsible = | author = | developer = VICE team | released = | latest release version = 2.2 | latest release date = {{Release date and age|2009|12|21}} | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = | operating system = [[Unix]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Win32]], [[Mac OS X]], [[OS/2]], [[RISC OS]], [[AmigaOS 4]], [[QNX]], [[BeOS]], [[GP2X]] | platform = | size = | language = | status = | genre = [[emulator]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]] | website = http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/ }} The software program '''VICE''', standing for '''''V'''ersat'''I'''le '''C'''ommodore '''E'''mulator'', is an [[emulator]] for [[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s [[8-bit]] computers, running on [[Amiga]], [[Unix]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Win32]], [[Mac OS X]], [[OS/2]], Acorn [[RISC OS]], and [[BeOS]] host machines. VICE is [[free software]], released under the [[GNU General Public Licence]]. As of 2004, VICE was one of the most widely-used emulators of the Commodore 8-bit microcomputers.<ref>Carless, p. 5</ref> It is also one of the few usable Commodore emulators to exist on free *NIX platforms, and one of the first to be distributed under GNU GPL. It is available for most Linux distributions. As of version 2.1, released December 19, 2008, VICE emulates the [[Commodore 64]], the [[Commodore 128|C128]], the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]], the [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]], the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]] (with its additional video modes) and all the [[Commodore PET|PET]] models including the [[Commodore CBM-II|CBM-II]] but excluding the 'non-standard' features of the SuperPET 9000. VICE for [[Microsoft Windows]] (Win32) is known as '''WinVICE''', the OS/2 variant is called Vice/2, and the emulator running on BeOS is called BeVICE. WinVICE supports digital [[joystick]]s via a [[parallel port]] [[device driver|driver]], and, with a [[CatWeasel]] [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] card, is planned to perform hardware [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] playback (requires optional SID [[Integrated circuit|chip]] installed in socket). == See also == * [[CCS64]] == References == {{reflist}} * Simon Carless, ''Gaming hacks'', O'Reilly Media, 2004, ISBN 0596007140, pp. 5-8 * Jason Kroll, ''[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3943 Commodore 64 Game Emulation]'', [[Linux Journal]], Issue 72, April 2000 == External links == *[http://www.viceteam.org VICE homepage], with [http://www.viceteam.org/vice_toc.html Online manual] ([[HTML]]) *[http://www.vicekb.de.vu VICE knowledge base] (preliminary) *[http://viceplus.sourceforge.net/ VICEplus] - [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of VICE including [[C64 Direct-to-TV|C64DTV]] emulation *[http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/VICE Guide for the often difficult installation with Linux and for Windows] *[http://user.tninet.se/~jad615g/prgstarter/ PRG Starter] - A great little tool for simple VICE usage [[Category:AmigaOS 4 software]] [[Category:AROS software]] [[Category:BeOS software]] [[Category:Commodore 64 emulators]] [[Category:Commodore VIC-20]] [[Category:DOS emulation software]] [[Category:Retrocomputing]] [[Category:GP2X emulation software]] [[Category:Mac OS X emulation software]] [[Category:MorphOS software]] [[Category:Linux emulation software]] [[Category:Windows emulation software]] [[Category:RISC OS software]] [[Category:Free emulation software]] [[Category:Unix emulation software]] [[de:VICE]] [[es:VICE]] [[it:VICE]] [[fi:VICE]] [[sv:VICE]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39126</id> <title>VISQ</title> <text>{{orphan|date=October 2009}} '''VISQ''' (Portuguese acronym for "Variables that Interact Semi-Quantitatively") is a scientific-educational [[software]] developed in 1993 by M. Thielo (as an [[physics]] undergrad at the time) and Kurtz dos Santos, based on Jon Ogborn ideas for semi-quantitative modeling of [[dynamical systems]], for both [[MS-DOS]] and [[Macintosh]] systems. Awarded by the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS) in 1994, the system is based on the theory of continuous [[neural networks]], and have been used in many research projects since then, mainly in Master Dissertations in the area of [[environmental education]].
