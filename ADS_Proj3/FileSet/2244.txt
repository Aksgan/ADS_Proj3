was used to evacuate a population of humans from the impending destruction of Earth. * The PC game [[Alien Legacy]] features "seedships", used to spread mankind due to an [[interstellar war]] that might wipe out the Earth. * The SS ''Botany Bay'' was a sleeper ship used by [[Khan Noonien Singh]] in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' first season episode "[[Space Seed]]". * A ''[[Star Trek The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' third season episode episode entitled "[[For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky]]" takes place on a hollow [[asteroid]] generation 'ship' called ''Yonada''. * The ''Centauri Princess'' is a cylindrical interstellar ark peopled with humans, depicted in elaborate detail in the novel ''First Ark to [[Alpha Centauri]]'' by A. Ahad * The cylindrical generation ship ''Vanguard'' serves as the centerpiece of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s [[1963]] novel ''[[Orphans of the Sky]]'', a combination of two shorter 1941 works. * In the animated Disney-Pixar film ''[[WALL-E]]'', the space vessel ''Axiom'', originally intended as a temporary dwelling for humanity for a 5 year period during which robots were to clean up an environmentally devastated Earth, becomes a de facto ark housing multiple generations of humans over a period of 700 years. * In ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' third season episode "The Ark", Colonel Sheppard's team discovers a facility inside a hollowed-out moon that turns out to be an ark created by the people of the planet around which the moon is in orbit. The ark was built to preserve the existence of the people from the planet and rebuild its civilization after a [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] defeat. People were stored in stasis in the ark using Wraith beaming technology. The government then waged an unwinnable war against the Wraith, and purposely decimated the remainder of their own population with [[atomic bomb]]s, leading the Wraith to believe that these people are extinct. * Episode 30 of the radio drama ''[[Dimension X]]'', "Universe", featured a seed ship whose human population had split into the lower deck inhabitants and the upper deck inhabitants. The upper deck inhabitants were mutated by radiation leaking through the ship's hull. The inhabitants were not aware they were on a ship and believed the vessel contained the entirety of the universe. The episode was written by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].<ref>http://www.otrplotspot.com/DimensionX.htm</ref><ref>http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Dimension_X_Singles</ref> * In the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' fictional universe, the [[Eldar]] race live and travel aboard interstellar arks, ''[[Eldar Craftworlds (Warhammer 40,000)|Craftworlds]]'' * In ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'', by ''[[Arthur C.

Sending of the [[Interstellar messages]] is potentially much easier than [[interstellar travel]], being possible with technologies and equipment which are currently available. However, successful communication requires someone at the other end to communicate ''with'', and in that regard it is currently not known whether interstellar communication is possible. == Radio == The [[SETI]] project has for the past several decades been conducting a search for signals being transmitted by [[extraterrestrial life]] located outside the [[solar system]], primarily in the [[radio]] frequencies of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Special attention has been given to the [[Water Hole]], the frequency of one of neutral [[hydrogen]]'s absorption lines, due to the low background noise at this frequency and its symbolic association with the basis for what is likely to be the most common system of [[biochemistry]] (see [[Alternative biochemistry]]). The regular radio pulses emitted by [[pulsar]]s were briefly thought to be potential intelligent signals; the first pulsar to be discovered was originally designated "LGM-1", for "Little Green Men." They were quickly determined to be of natural origin, however. Several attempts have been made to transmit signals to other stars as well, see "Realized projects" at [[Active SETI]] and [http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/index.html Interstellar Radio Messages]. One of the earliest and most famous was the 1974 radio message sent from the largest radio telescope in the world, [[Arecibo]], in Puerto Rico. An extremely simple message was aimed at a [[globular cluster|globular cluster of stars]] known as [[Messier 13|M13]] in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] and at a distance of 30,000 [[light year]]s from our [[solar system]]. These efforts have been more symbolic than anything else, however. Further, a possible answer needs double the [[travel time]], i.e. tens of years (near stars) or 60,000 years (M13). Sending Interstellar Radio Messages between stars may prove to be optimal for many applications.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2008.05.014 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V1N-4SV6PBV-1&_user=10&_coverDate=09/30/2008&_rdoc=9&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235679%232008%23999369994%23693834%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=5679&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=18&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=d2d6af37681f824c29243809b1d55298&searchtype=a |title=Sending and Searching for Interstellar Messages |first=Alexander L. |last=Zaitsev |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=63 |pages=614–617 |year=2008}}</ref> ==Other methods== It has also been proposed that higher frequency signals, such as [[laser]]s operating at [[visible light]] frequencies, may prove to be a fruitful method of interstellar communication; at a given frequency it takes surprisingly small energy output for a laser emitter to outshine its local [[star]] from the perspective of its target{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. Other more exotic methods of communication have been proposed, such as modulated [[neutrino]] or [[gravitational wave]] emissions. These would have the advantage of being essentially immune to interference by intervening matter, but are very difficult to generate or detect with current technology. Sending physical mail packets between stars may prove to be optimal for many applications.<ref name="probes">{{cite journal |url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/InterstellarProbesJBIS1980.htm |title=Interstellar Probes: A New Approach To Seti |first=Robert A.

The possibility of using interstellar messenger probes for interstellar communication &mdash; known as [[Bracewell probe]]s &mdash; was first suggested by
