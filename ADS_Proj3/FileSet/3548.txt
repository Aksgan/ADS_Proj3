Because PET imaging is most useful in combination with anatomical imaging, such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-end multi-detector-row CT scanners. Because the two scans can be performed in immediate sequence during the same session, with the patient not changing position between the two types of scans, the two sets of images are more-precisely [[image registration|registered]], so that areas of abnormality on the PET imaging can be more perfectly correlated with anatomy on the CT images. This is very useful in showing detailed views of moving organs or structures with higher anatomical variation, which is more common outside the brain. At the [[Forschungszentrum Jülich|Jülich]] Institute of Neurosciences and Biophysics, the world's largest PET/MRI device began operation in April 2009: a 9.4-[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnetic resonance tomograph (MRT) combined with a positron emission tomograph (PET). Presently, only the head and brain can be imaged at these high magnetic field strengths.<ref name="PET_MRT">{{cite news | title = A Close Look Into the Brain | publisher = [[Jülich Research Centre]] | date = 29 April 2009 | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | url = http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/index.php?index=1172}}</ref> === Radionuclides === [[Radionuclide]]s used in PET scanning are typically [[isotope]]s with short [[half life|half lives]] such as [[carbon-11]] (~20 min), [[nitrogen-13]] (~10 min), [[oxygen-15]] (~2 min), and [[fluorine-18]] (~110 min). These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally used by the body such as [[glucose]] (or glucose analogues), [[water]] or [[ammonia]], or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action. Such labelled compounds are known as [[radiotracer]]s. It is important to recognize that PET technology can be used to trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. Thus the specific processes that can be probed with PET are virtually limitless, and radiotracers for new target molecules and processes are being synthesized all the time; as of this writing there are already dozens in clinical use and hundreds applied in research. Presently, however, by far the most commonly used radiotracer in clinical PET scanning is [[Fludeoxyglucose]], an analogue of glucose that is labeled with fluorine-18. Due to the short half lives of most radioisotopes, the radiotracers must be produced using a [[cyclotron]] in close proximity to the PET imaging facility. The half life of fluorine-18 is long enough that radiotracers labeled with fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially at offsite locations and shipped to imaging centers. === Limitations === The minimization of radiation dose to the subject is an attractive feature of the use of short-lived radionuclides. Besides its established role as a diagnostic technique, PET has an expanding role as a method to assess the response to therapy, in particular, cancer therapy,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Young H, Baum R, Cremerius U, ''et al.'' | title=Measurement of clinical and subclinical tumour response using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography: review and 1999 EORTC recommendations.| journal=European Journal of Cancer| volume=35 | issue=13 | year=1999| pages=1773–1782 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-8049(99)00229-4 | pmid=10673991}}</ref> where the risk to the patient from lack of knowledge about disease progress is much greater than the risk from the test radiation. Limitations to the widespread use of PET arise from the high costs of [[cyclotrons]] needed to produce the short-lived [[radionuclides]] for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus to produce the radiopharmaceuticals. Few hospitals and universities are capable of maintaining such systems, and most clinical PET is supported by third-party suppliers of radiotracers which can supply many sites simultaneously. This limitation restricts clinical PET primarily to the use of tracers labelled with fluorine-18, which has a half life of 110 minutes and can be transported a reasonable distance before use, or to [[rubidium-82 chloride|rubidium-82]], which can be created in a portable generator and is used for [[myocardium|myocardial]] [[perfusion]] studies. Nevertheless, in recent years a few on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and hot labs have begun to accompany PET units to remote hospitals. The presence of the small on-site cyclotron promises to expand in the future as the cyclotrons shrink in response to the high cost of isotope transportation to remote PET machines <ref>[http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp Technology | July 2003: Trends in MRI | Medical Imaging<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Because the half-life of fluorine-18 is about two hours, the prepared dose of a radiopharmaceutical bearing this radionuclide will undergo multiple half-lives of decay during the working day. This necessitates frequent recalibration of the remaining dose (determination of activity per unit volume) and careful planning with respect to patient scheduling. === Image reconstruction === The raw data collected by a PET scanner are a list of 'coincidence events' representing near-simultaneous detection (typically, within a window of 6 to 12 nanoseconds of each other) of annihilation photons by a pair of detectors. Each coincidence event represents a line in space connecting the two detectors along which the positron emission occurred. Modern systems with a higher time resolution (roughly 3 nanoseconds) also use a technique (called "Time-of-flight") where they more precisely decide the difference in time between the detection of the two photons and can thus localize the point of origin of the annihilation event between the two detectors to within 10 cm. Coincidence events can be grouped into projection images, called [[sinogram]]s. The sinograms are sorted by the angle of each view and tilt (for 3D images). The sinogram images are analogous to the projections captured by [[computed tomography]] (CT)
