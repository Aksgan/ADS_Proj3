SID is in a standard NT 4.0 format (3 32-bit subauthorities preceded by three 32-bit authority fields). Next, NewSID generates a new random SID for the computer. NewSID's generation takes great pains to create a truly random 96-bit value, which replaces the 96-bits of the 3 subauthority values that make up a computer SID." ** From NewSID readme. === Decoding Machine SID === {{quote||The SID number is used in file, registry, service and users permissions. The machine SID is determined in hexadecimal form from here: regedit.exe -> \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\V (last 12 bytes) explorer.exe -> \%windir%\system32\config\SAM If the SAM file is missing at startup, a backup is retrieved in hexadecimal form here: regedit.exe -> \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\PolAcDmS\@ (last 12 bytes) explorer.exe -> \%windir%\system32\config\SECURITY Sometimes the SID number is referenced in decimal form.

The primary function of TSA Security Operations Centers are to act as a communication hub for security personnel, law enforcement, airport personnel and various other agencies involved in the daily operations of airports. SOCs are manned 24-hours a day by SOC Watch Officers. Security Operations Center Watch Officers are trained in all aspects of airport and aviation security and are often required to work abnormal shifts. SOC Watch Officers also ensure that TSA personnel follow proper protocol in dealing with airport security operations. The SOC is usually the first to be notified of incidents at airports such as the discovery of prohibited items/contraband, weapons, explosives, hazardous materials as well as incidents regarding flight delays, unruly passengers, injuries, damaged equipment and various other types of potential security threats. The SOC in turn relays all information pertaining to these incidents to TSA federal security directors, law enforcement and TSA headquarters. == References == {{reflist}} {{US-org-stub}} [[Category:Organizations based in the United States]] [[Category:Security]] [[Category:Surveillance]] [[Category:Security engineering]] [[it:Security Operation Center]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33643</id> <title>Security Support Provider Interface</title> <text>'''Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)''' is an [[Application programming interface|API]] used by Microsoft Windows systems to perform a variety of security related operations such as authentication.
