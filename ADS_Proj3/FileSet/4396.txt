''The Anatomy of Melancholy'' has often been out of print, most notably between 1676 and 1800.<ref name="complete-review">[http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/divphil/burtonr.htm ''The Complete Review'' discussion] of ''The Anatomy of Melancholy''</ref> Because no original manuscript of the ''Anatomy'' has survived, later reprints have drawn more or less faithfully from the editions published during Burton's life.<ref name="gassintro">William H. Gass, Introduction to ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'', New York Review of Books 2001 ISBN 0-940322-66-8</ref> Early editions of the ''Anatomy'' are now in the [[public domain]], with several available in their entirety from a number of online sources such as [[Project Gutenberg]]. In recent years, increased interest in the book, combined with its status as a public domain work, has resulted in a number of new print editions, most recently a 2001 reprinting of the 1932 edition by ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' under its ''[[NYRB Classics]]'' [[imprint]] (ISBN 0-940322-66-8).<ref name="theguardian1" /> == Synopsis == Burton defined his subject as follows: <blockquote>''Melancholy'', the subject of our present discourse, is either in disposition or in [[Habit (psychology)|habit]]. In disposition, is that transitory ''Melancholy'' which goes and comes upon every small occasion of sorrow, need, sickness, trouble, fear, grief, passion, or perturbation of the mind, any manner of care, discontent, or thought, which causes anguish, dulness, heaviness and vexation of spirit, any ways opposite to pleasure, mirth, joy, delight, causing frowardness in us, or a dislike. In which equivocal and improper sense, we call him melancholy, that is dull, sad, sour, lumpish, ill-disposed, solitary, any way moved, or displeased. And from these melancholy dispositions no man living is free, no Stoick, none so wise, none so happy, none so patient, so generous, so godly, so divine, that can vindicate himself; so well-composed, but more or less, some time or other, he feels the smart of it. Melancholy in this sense is the character of Mortality. . . . This ''Melancholy'' of which we are to treat, is a habit, a serious ailment, a settled [[The four humours|humour]], as Aurelianus and others call it, not errant, but fixed: and as it was long increasing, so, now being (pleasant or painful) grown to a habit, it will hardly be removed.</blockquote> In attacking his stated subject, Burton drew from nearly every science of his day, including [[psychology]] and [[physiology]], but also [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]], and [[theology]], and even [[astrology]] and [[demonology]]. Much of the book consists of quotations from various ancient and mediæval medical authorities, beginning with [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Galen]]. Hence the ''Anatomy'' is filled with more or less pertinent references to the works of others. A competent Latinist, Burton also included a great deal of [[Latin]] [[poetry]] in the ''Anatomy'', and many of his inclusions from ancient sources are left untranslated in the text. ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'' is an especially lengthy book, the first edition being a single [[quarto]] volume nearly 900 pages long; subsequent editions were even longer. The text is divided into three major sections plus an introduction, the whole written in Burton's sprawling style. Characteristically, the introduction includes not only an author's note (titled "Democritus Junior to the Reader"), but also a Latin poem ("Democritus Junior to His Book"), a warning to "The Reader Who Employs His Leisure Ill", an abstract of the following text, and another poem explaining the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]]. The following three sections proceed in a similarly exhaustive fashion: the first section focuses on the causes and symptoms of "common" melancholies, while the second section deals with cures for melancholy, and the third section explores more complex and esoteric melancholies, including the melancholy of lovers and all varieties of religious melancholies. The ''Anatomy'' concludes with an extensive index (which, many years later, ''The New York Times Book Review'' called "a readerly pleasure in itself"<ref>Thomas Mallon, ''The New York Times Book Review'', October 3, 1991</ref>). Most modern editions include many explanatory notes, and translate most of the Latin.<ref name="theguardian1" /> == Critical reception == Admirers of ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'' range from [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Holbrook Jackson]] (whose ''Bibliomania'' was based on the style and presentation) , [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], and [[John Keats]] (who said it was his favourite book), to [[Stanley Fish]], [[Philip Pullman]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (who used a quote as an epigraph to his story "[[The Library of Babel]]"), [[Nick Cave]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and [[Jacques Barzun]] (who sees in it many anticipations of 20th century [[psychiatry]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' literary critic [[Nick Lezard]], the ''Anatomy'' "survives among the cognoscenti."<ref>Nick Lezard, "[http://books.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4065172-99931,00.html Classics of the Future,]" ''The Guardian'', September 16, 2000.</ref> Burton's solemn tone and his endeavour to prove indisputable facts by weighty quotations were ridiculed by [[Lawrence Sterne]] in his ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''.<ref name="FerriarGravity">Ferriar (1798), chapter 3, pp.55-9, 64</ref><ref name="Petrie70">Petrie (1970) pp.261-2</ref> Sterne also mocked Burton's quaint and old fashioned divisions in the ludicrous titles of his chapters, and parodied his grave and sober account of Cicero's grief for the death of his daughter [[Tullia]].<ref name="FerriarGravity"/> ==Notes== <!--<nowiki> See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below. </nowiki>--> {{Reflist}} == References == *[[John Ferriar|Ferriar, John]] (1798) ''[http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924013199850 Illustrations of Sterne]'' *[[Graham Petrie|Petrie, Graham]] (1970) ''[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3723527 A Rhetorical Topic in "Tristram Shandy"]'', [[Modern Language Review]], Vol. 65, No. 2, April 1970, pp. 261–66 == Further reading == * {{cite news |title=Remedial Reading: William Monahan on The Anatomy of Melancholy, by Robert Burton, introduction by William H.
