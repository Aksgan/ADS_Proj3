The process of estimating a camera's motion within an environment involves the use of [[visual odometry]] techniques on a sequence of images captured by the moving camera<ref name="milella" />. This is typically done using [[feature detection]] to construct an [[optical flow]] from two image frames in a sequence<ref name="irani" /> generated from either single cameras or stereo cameras<ref name="milella">{{cite journal | author = Milella, A. | coauthors = Siegwart, R. | title = Stereo-Based Ego-Motion Estimation Using Pixel Tracking and Iterative Closest Point | url = http://asl.epfl.ch/aslInternalWeb/ASL/publications/uploadedFiles/21_amilella_EgoMotion_rev_publication.pdf | journal = IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Systems | pages = 21 | year = 2006 | month = January | accessdate = 7 June 2010 }}</ref>.

Features are detected in the first frame, and then matched in the second frame. This information is then used to make the optical flow field for the detected features in those two images. The optical flow field illustrates how features diverge from a single point, the ''focus of expansion''. The focus of expansion can be detected from the optical flow field, indicating the direction of the motion of the camera, and thus providing an estimate of the camera motion. There are other methods of extracting egomotion information from images as well, including a method that avoids feature detection and optical flow fields and directly uses the image intensities<ref name="irani" />. ==See also== * [[Visual odometry]] ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Computer vision]] {{Comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>11767</id> <title>Egyptian National Library and Archives</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=April 2010}} The '''Egyptian National Library and Archives''' ({{lang-ar|Dar el-Kotob}}) in [[Cairo]] is the largest [[library]] in [[Egypt]]. The second largest are the libraries of [[Al-Azhar University]] and the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] (New Library of Alexandria). The National Library, the oldest government library, houses several million volumes on a wide range of topics. It is one of the largest in the world with thousands of [[ancient]] collections. It also contains a vast variety of [[Arabic]]-language and other Eastern manuscripts. The main library is a seven-story building in Ramlet [[Boulaq]], a [[district]] of Cairo. The Egyptian [[National Archives]] are contained in an annex beside the building. ==History== It was started in 1870 by a [[decree]] from [[Khedive Ismail]] through an initiative from [[Ali Pasha Mubarak]], the education minister at the time. In its first decades the position of director were held by German Orientalists, most notable among them were [[Karl Vollers]] and [[Bernhardt Moritz]]. ==Contents== Collections include a wide variety of manuscripts of the [[Qur'an]], written on paper and parchment, with some in the early undotted [[Kufic]] script, other written by celebrated [[calligraphy|calligraphers]]. Of Egyptian [[Islam]]ic materials, there is perhaps the outstanding collection of illuminated [[manuscripts]] of the Qur'an in the [[Mamluk]] text-hand, and in Trilinear and [[Rayhan]]i hands. There are also collections of Arabic [[papyri]] from different sites in Egypt, some dating to the 7th century AD or earlier. The library is a mine of information on early Islamic Egypt's social and cultural life. Ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] collections are also housed. The library's great resources in manuscripts and documents include more than 57,000 of the most valuable manuscripts in the world. The manuscript collection covers a vast number of subjects, fully documented, dated, and compiled. It also houses a rare number of [[Arabic]] papyri. These are related to marriage, rent, and exchange contracts, as well as records, accounts of taxes, distribution of inheritance, etc. The oldest papyrus group dates back to the year AH 87 (AD 705); only 444 papyri from this collection were published. The Library also has a large collection of medieval Arabic [[coin]]s from as early as AD 696, which were published by [[Stanley Lane-Poole]], Bernhardt Moritz and recently by [[Norman D. Nicol]], [[Jere L. Bacharach]] and [[Rifa'at al-Nabarawy]] (1982). Collections formed by Taymour Pasha, Ahmed
