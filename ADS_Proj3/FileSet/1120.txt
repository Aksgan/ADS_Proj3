Burke's work in communication has spanned many fields and focuses primarily on rhetoric. Perhaps he is best known for his theory of [[Dramatism]], wherein he characterizes life to not just reflect or be like a drama but rather that life is drama.<ref>Miller, K. ''Communication theories: Perspective, processes and contexts'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 2005), p. 96</ref> ==Definition== Burke's definition of man states: "Man is the symbol-using (symbol-making, symbol-misusing) animal, inventor of the negative (or moralized by the negative), separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy (or moved by the sense of order), and rotten with perfection".<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p. 16</ref> Essentially, Burke's definition maintains that man is distinct from other creatures by the virtue of his use of symbols to communicate, his understanding of negation, his separation from nature by his own techniques, his existence in differing social structures, and his goal to become better than he presently is. ==Symbol-Using Animal== Burke distinguishes man from other animals by drawing an [[analogy]] between man and birds. He argues that unlike birds, which cannot use [[symbol]]s to communicate, man is able to use [[language]] towards pragmatic ends. To illustrate this point, Burke recalls seeing a bird trapped inside a college classroom. The windows were open, but the bird kept flying upwards to the ceiling, rather than through the window. If the bird could use symbols to communicate then one could simply inform the bird of the open windows and it could fly out to freedom. Its natural instinct to fly up coupled by its inability to use symbols, however, prevents its escape. Burke, also argues that not only does man use symbols, but concedes that man makes and misuses symbols as well.<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p.3-4</ref> ==Condensation== One aspect of symbols that Burke points out in his discussion of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work is condensation. This explains man's ability to condense symbols into categories that can be understood by others to include a variety of other symbols. The example he gives is using the word furniture to refer to chairs, tables, etc.<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p.7</ref> Burke's defining of man in these terms leads to man's quest for [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and social belonging.<ref>MacLennan, J. (2005). A rhetorical journey into darkness: Crime scene profiling as Burkean analysis. ''KBJounal, 1'', (2). Retrieved October 26, 2006, from www.kbjournal.org</ref> Burke sees all human action as infused with symbols. These symbols are used to help create our sense of who we are and where we fit. In order to accomplish these, man seeks for differences and commonalities respectively. ==Inventor of the Negative== While Burke struggles with using the word inventor for he feels that language has invented man, he points out that negatives do not exist in nature. He contends that negatives are purely a characteristic of symbol systems, which he has already determined belong uniquely to man. He further refers to morality as being particularly human and based largely on the idea of negatives; that is, there are things we should not do.<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p.9-13</ref> Intrinsic to this portion of Burke's Definition is the idea of [[paradox]]. Burke explains that the idea of negation is, by its nature, paradoxical. He explains that conditioning a statement with a negative draws a positive image of that very statement. This, he argues, defeats the purpose of negation, yet is an inescapable situation.<ref>Brock, B., Burke, K., Burgess, P., & Simons, H. (1985) Dramatism as ontology or epistemology: A symposium. ''Communication Quarterly'', 33, 17-33.</ref> ==Separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making== In this section of Burke's definition he describes man's natural state as being that of basic needs and appetites. However, because of his tools and language, he has taken on a nature completely different that that of his original state. He cites an example of a day when the electricity of New York City went out and how unnatural it seemed for the streets to be filled with darkness; darkness being a state of man's first nature. However, because of man's tools, a state of lighted streets has become natural.<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p.13-15</ref> One major example of man's instruments is exemplified in [[technology]].<ref>Wess, R. (2006). Ecocriticism and Kenneth Burke: An introduction. ''KBJournal, 2'' (2). Retrieved October 26, 2006, from www.kbjournal.org</ref> Technology has accomplished the task of separating man from nature. ==Goaded by the spirit of hierarchy== This portion of Burke's description seeks to define man as being drawn to order and status. He points to positions in society that imply this fact. One such example he draws upon is the division of labor that exists in society. Others are titles of nobility and peasantry.<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p.15-16</ref> ==Rotten with perfection== This last portion of Burke's definition has particular importance to his other philosophical theories of man. Man being rotten with perfection speaks to the motives that are distinct in man; motives being an intrinsic part of Burke's [[Dramatism]], distinguishing action from motion. Burke refers to [[Aristotle]]'s notion of [[entelechy]], which states that we seek
