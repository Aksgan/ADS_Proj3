When old sources are digitized, linking of data sets is a prerequisite for [[longitudinal study]]. This process is often further complicated by lack of standard spelling of names, family names that change according to place of dwelling, changing of administrative boundaries and problems of checking the data against other sources. Record Linkage was among the most prominent themes in the [[History and computing]] field in the 1980s, but has since been subject to less attention in research. ===Applications in medical practice and research=== <!-- any experts out there? --> Record linkage is an important tool in creating data required for examining the health of the public and of the health care system itself. It can be used to improve data holdings, data collection, quality assessment, and the dissemination of information. Data sources can be examined to eliminate duplicate records, to identify underreporting and missing cases (e.g., census population counts), to create person-oriented health statistics, and to generate disease registries and health surveillance systems. Some cancer registries link various data sources (e.g., hospital admissions, pathology and clinical reports, and death registrations) to generate their registries. Record linkage is also used to create health indicators. For example, fetal and infant mortality is a general indicator of a country's socioeconomic development, public health, and maternal and child services. If infant death records are matched to birth records, it is possible to use birth variables, such as birth weight and gestational age, along with mortality data, such as cause of death, in analyzing the data. Linkages can help in follow-up studies of cohorts or other groups to determine factors such as vital status, residential status, or health outcomes. Tracing is often needed for follow-up of industrial cohorts, clinical trials, and longitudinal surveys to obtain the cause of death and/or cancer. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.semaphorecorp.com/mpdd/mpdd.html Discussion of record linkage strategy and tactics] * [http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/policies-and-guidelines/data-integration/further-technical-information.aspx Statistics New Zealand Data Integration Manual] * [http://pike.psu.edu/linkage/ Data Linkage Project at Penn State, USA] ===Software implementations=== *[http://oscmt.sourceforge.net Open Source ChoiceMaker Technology] - released by ChoiceMaker Technologies *[http://datamining.anu.edu.au/projects/linkage.html#project_description Febrl - Open source software application for RL] - by the [[Australian National University]]. *[http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/tools/registryplus/lp_tech_info.htm Link Plus Probabilistic record linkage program] - developed at the US [[Centers For Disease Control and Prevention]] *[http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/Research/Area/datainfo/FRIL/ FRIL - Fine-Grained Record Integration and Linkage Tool] - developed at the [[Emory University]] and US [[Centers For Disease Control and Prevention]] *[http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/ SimMetrics Open source library of String Similarity techniques] - by Sam Chapman at the [[University of Sheffield]] *[http://www.the-link-king.com The Link King - SAS System application] - developed at Washington State's Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse (DASA) by Kevin M.

Not all problems in this field require a knowledge of advanced mathematics, and thus, recreational mathematics often attracts the curiosity of non-mathematicians, and inspires their further study of mathematics. == Topics == This genre of mathematics includes [[logic puzzle]]s and other puzzles that require [[deductive]] reasoning, the [[aesthetics]] of mathematics, and peculiar or amusing stories and [[mathematical coincidence|coincidences about mathematics]] and mathematicians. Some of the more well-known topics in recreational mathematics are [[magic squares]] and [[fractals]]. === Mathematical games === [[Mathematical games]] are [[multiplayer game]]s whose rules, strategies, and outcomes can be studied and explained by [[mathematics]]. The players of the game may not need to use mathematics in order to play mathematical games. For example, [[Mancala]] is a mathematical game, because mathematicians can study it using [[combinatorial game theory]], even though no mathematics is necessary in order to play it. === Mathematical puzzles === [[Mathematical puzzles]] require mathematics in order to solve them. They have specific rules, as do [[multiplayer games]], but mathematical puzzles don't usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, in order to solve such a [[puzzle]], the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. [[Logic puzzle]]s are a common type of mathematical puzzle. [[Conway's Game of Life]] and [[fractals]] are also considered mathematical puzzles, even though the solver only interacts with them by providing a set of initial conditions. Sometimes, [[mathematical puzzles]] are referred to as mathematical games as well. === Others === Other curiosities and pastimes of non-trivial mathematical interest: * [[Juggling]] (juggling patterns) * [[Origami]] (many mathematical results, some deep) * [[Cat's cradle]] and other [[string figure]]s == Publications ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Mathematical game]] --> * The ''[[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]]'' is the largest publication on this topic. * ''Mathematical Games'' was the title of a long-running column on the subject by [[Martin Gardner]], in [[Scientific American]]. He inspired several new generations of mathematicians and scientists, through his interest in mathematical recreations. ''Mathematical Games'' was succeeded by ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'', a similarly distinguished, but shorter-running, column by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], then by ''Mathematical Recreations'', a column by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], and most recently ''Puzzling Adventures'' by Dennis Shasha. ;In popular culture * In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[42 (Doctor Who)|42]]", [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] completes a sequence of [[happy number|happy primes]], then complains that schools no longer teach recreational mathematics. * ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime]]'', a book about a young boy with [[Asperger syndrome]], discusses many mathematical
