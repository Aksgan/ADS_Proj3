first place. An appeals court ruled in favor of Xerox with regard to the original ruling that Palm had violated its patent but sent the case back down to the lower court to decide whether the patent was valid to begin with. In 2004, a judge ruled in favor of Palm, saying Xerox's patent was not valid on the basis that ''"prior art references anticipate and render obvious the claim."'' <ref>[http://www.theregister.com/2004/05/24/palm_vs_xerox/ PalmOne overturns Xerox Graffiti patent], ''[[The Register]]'', 2004-05-24</ref> Xerox appealed the ruling.<ref>[http://www.technewsworld.com/story/software/33999.html Xerox To Appeal PalmOne Ruling], TechNewsWorld, 2004-05-25</ref> and won, obtaining $US 22.5 million in retrospective licensing fees.

The first eight issues each came on a single [[floppy disk]], but as the magazine became more popular and more articles were submitted by its readers, it required two to three disks per issue after that point. The editor of Grapevine was known as Parasite, later PaZZa/LSD. The magazine was originally coded by Monty Python, and then re-coded with a mouse driven interface later in the series by Shagratt. '''Grapevine''' existed at a time when Internet use was not widespread in its native UK or abroad, and hence editions of the magazine were hotly traded amongst the demo scene. LSD sent out hundreds of floppy disk copies on each release, and most PD libraries at the time were keen to include the latest issues as soon as they were released. As a result of this, PD libraries cut deals with PaZZa to ensure distribution, much to the distain of other members of the group he purported to lead, who were shut out of these financial benefits. == Breadth of topics == Grapevine accepted articles not only about the demo scene itself, as most scene disk magazines did, but on a diverse range of subjects including gaming, music, sports, humour, comics, and even pieces of original fiction and poetry. == Secret articles == Several issues of the magazine contained "secret" articles. To access them, press Esc and type in the corresponding password, followed by Enter: *08 - "recoded" *09 - "party" *10 - "bust" *11 - "quartz" *12 - "bastard" *13 - "ho ho ho" *14 - "late" *15 - "secretmenu" *16 - "wombatateam" *17 - "party" *18 - "xmas" *19 - None (by looking at the data files with a hex editor, "HI ROMBUST, THERES NO SECTRET ARTICLE!" [sic] appears in the code, where the password should be) == Revival == An attempt was made in 2005 to revive Grapevine, in the form of a web-based magazine. However, this was done unofficially by a
