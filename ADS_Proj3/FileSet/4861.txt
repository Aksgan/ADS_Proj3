features not found in PCs of the time, such as high-speed networking and sophisticated graphics. Workstation manufacturers also tend to take a "balanced" approach to system design, making certain to avoid bottlenecks so that data can flow unimpeded between the many different subsystems within a computer. Additionally, workstations, given their more specialized nature, tend to have higher [[profit margin]]s than [[commodity]]-driven PCs. The systems that come out of workstation companies often feature [[SCSI]] or [[Fibre Channel]] disk storage systems, high-end [[3D accelerator]]s, single or multiple [[64-bit]] [[central processing unit|processors]], large amounts of [[random access memory|RAM]], and well-designed cooling. Additionally, the companies that make the products tend to have very good repair/replacement plans. However, the line between workstation and PC is increasingly becoming blurred as the demand for fast computers, networking and graphics have become common in the consumer world, allowing workstation manufacturers to use "off the shelf" PC components and graphics solutions as opposed to [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] in-house developed technology. Some "low-cost" workstations are still expensive by PC standards, but offer binary compatibility with higher-end workstations and servers made by the same vendor. This allows software development to take place on low-cost (relative to the server) desktop machines. There have been several attempts to produce a workstation-like machine specifically for the lowest possible price point as opposed to performance. One approach is to remove local storage and reduce the machine to the processor, keyboard, mouse and screen. In some cases, these ''[[diskless node]]s'' would still run a traditional OS and perform computations locally, with storage on a remote [[Server (computing)|server]]. These approaches are intended not just to reduce the initial system purchase cost, but lower the [[total cost of ownership]] by reducing the amount of administration required per user. This approach was actually first attempted as a replacement for PCs in office productivity applications, with the [[3Station]] by [[3Com]] as an early example; in the 1990s, [[X terminal]]s filled a similar role for technical computing. Sun has also introduced "[[thin client]]s", most notably its [[Sun Ray]] product line. However, traditional workstations and PCs continue to drop in price, which tends to undercut the market for products of this type. ===Workstation class PCs=== A significant segment of the desktop market are computers expected to perform as workstations, but using PC operating systems and components. PC component manufacturers will often segment their product line, and market premium components which are functionally similar to the cheaper "consumer" models but feature a higher level of robustness and/or performance. Notable examples of this are the [[AMD]] [[Opteron]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[Xeon]] processors, and the [[ATI FireGL]] and [[Nvidia Quadro]] graphics processors. A workstation class PC may have some of the following features: * support for [[ECC memory]] * a larger number of memory sockets which use registered (buffered) modules * multiple processor sockets, powerful CPUs (for Intel CPU it will be server derived [[Xeon]] instead of typical for PCs [[Intel Core i7|Core]]) * multiple displays * run reliable operating system with advanced features * high performance graphics card == Current workstation market == Of historic [[Unix]] workstation manufacturers, only [[Sun Microsystems]] continues its product line. As of January 2009 all [[RISC]]-based workstation product lines have been discontinued, IBM retiring its [[IntelliStation]] product line at that date.<ref>[http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/rep_ca/0/897/ENUS908-170/ENUS908-170.PDF Official IBM Hardware Withdrawal Announcement] of IntelliStation POWER 185 and 285.</ref> The current workstation market uses x86-64 microprocessors. Operating systems available for these platforms include [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], the different [[Linux distribution]]s, [[Mac OS X]] and [[Solaris 10]]. Three types of products are marketed under the workstation umbrella: * Workstation blade systems (IBM HC10 or Hewlett-Packard xw460c. Sun Visualization System is akin to these solutions) * Ultra high-end workstation ([[SGI Virtu]] VS3xx) * High-end deskside system two ways capable x64 systems Some vendors also market commodity mono socket systems as workstations. ==List of manufacturers== ===Current=== *[[Acer Inc.|Acer]] *[[Alienware]] *[[Apple Inc.]] *[[AVADirect]] *[[BOXX Technologies]] *[[Dell, Inc.|Dell]] *[[Fujitsu-Siemens Computers]] *[[Hewlett-Packard]] *[[Lenovo]] *[[MAINGEAR]] *[[Silicon Graphics]] *[[Sun Microsystems]] *[[Workstation Specialists]] ===Defunct=== *[[Apollo Computer]] *[[Ardent Computer]] *[[Callan Data Systems]] *[[Computervision]] *[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] *[[Evans & Sutherland]] (operating, but no longer manufactures workstations) *[[Intergraph]] *[[InterPro]] *[[MIPS Computer Systems]] *[[NeXT]] *[[Stardent Inc.]] *[[Three Rivers Computer Corporation]] *[[Torch Computers]] *[[Xworks Interactive]] ==See also== *[[Music workstation]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{FOLDOC}} {{Computer sizes}} [[Category:Computer workstations|*Computer workstation]] [[Category:Classes of computers]] [[bs:Radna stanica]] [[ca:Estació de treball]] [[cs:Pracovní stanice]] [[de:Workstation]] [[es:Estación de trabajo]] [[fa:ایستگاه کاری]] [[fr:Station de travail]] [[ko:워크스테이션]] [[it:Workstation]] [[lt:Darbo stotis]] [[hu:Munkaállomás]] [[ms:Stesen kerja]] [[mn:Уоркстейшн]] [[nl:Werkstation]] [[ja:ワークステーション]] [[pl:Stacja robocza]] [[pt:Estação de trabalho]] [[ru:Рабочая станция]] [[simple:Workstation]] [[sk:Workstation]] [[sr:Радна станица]] [[fi:Työasema]] [[sv:Arbetsstation]] [[tr:Workstation]] [[vi:Workstation]] [[zh:工作站]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40506</id> <title>WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival</title> <text>{{Infobox Film Festival | | name = WorldFest Houston International Film Festival | image = | caption = AMC Studio 30 Dunvale Theatre entrance during WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival | host = Houston Film Society | number = 55-60 shown | location = [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]] | website = http://www.worldfest.org/ }} '''WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival''' is an annual [[film festival]], dedicated to various types of independent films, held in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. ==History== WorldFest-Houston is one of the three original international [[film festivals]] in North America, after San Francisco and New York. It was founded in 1961 as Cinema Arts, an International Film Society. WorldFest/Cinema Arts became a competitive International Film Festival in 1967 and presented its first edition in April 1968. It is the only international film festival in North America to be dedicated completely to independent films, as it does not accept films from the major studios. The festival was founded by producer/director Hunter Todd to present a film festival for [[independent filmmakers]].<ref>[http://www.worldfest.org/PAGES/history.htm WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> WorldFest-Houston is the oldest film festival in the South of the USA and its Founding Director Hunter Todd is one of the longest running festival directors in the world, having started the festival in 1961. ==Events== The festival presents around 55 new Indie feature films and 100 new Indie Short films during the ten-day film festival each April. Aside from the film viewing, the festival offers six Master Classes, professional seminars,
