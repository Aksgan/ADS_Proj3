Galton, by 1892 Sir [[Francis Galton]], having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book ''Finger Prints''. He had calculated that the chance of a "false positive" (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion.<ref name= galtonfps>{{Cite web | url = http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/galton-1892-fingerprints-lowres.pdf | last = Galton | first = Francis | year = 1892 | title = Finger Prints | location = London | publisher = MacMillan and Co }}</ref> [[Juan Vucetich]], an Argentine chief police officier, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file, associating these fingerprints to the anthropometric system of [[Alphonse Bertillon]], who had created, in 1879, a system to identify individuals by anthropometric photographs and associated quantitative descriptions. A year later, in 1892, after studying Galton's pattern types, Vucetich set up the world's first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of [[Necochea]], was found in a house with neck injuries, whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas' prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons. A Fingerprint Bureau was established in Calcutta ([[Kolkata]]), India, in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. Working in the Calcutta Anthropometric Bureau, before it became the Fingerprint Bureau, were [[Azizul Haque]] and [[Hem Chandra Bose]]. Haque and Bose were Indian fingerprint experts who have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor, [[Edward Henry|Sir Edward Richard Henry]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tewari | first1 = RK | last2 = Ravikumar | first2 = KV | title = History and development of forensic science in India | journal = J.

Sir Edward Richard Henry subsequently achieved improvements in dactyloscopy. In the United States, Dr [[Henry P. DeForrest]] used fingerprinting in the [[New York Police Department|New York Civil Service]] in 1902, and by 1906, [[New York City Police Department]] Deputy Commissioner Joseph A. Faurot, an expert in the Bertillon system and a finger print advocate at Police Headquarters, introduced the fingerprinting of criminals to the United States. The Scheffer case of 1902 is the first case of the identification, arrest and conviction of a murderer based upon fingerprint evidence. [[Alphonse Bertillon]] identified the thief and murderer Scheffer, who had previously been arrested and his fingerprints filed some months before, from the fingerprints found on a fractured glass showcase, after a theft in a dentist's apartment where the dentist's employee was found dead. It was able to be proved in Court that the fingerprints had been made after the showcase was broken.<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/celebrations2002/empreintes.htm | first = Jean-Marc | last = Berlière | publisher = Célébrations Nationales | title = Arrestation du premier assassin confondu par ses empreintes digitales | date = October 16, 1902 }}</ref> A year later, [[Alphonse Bertillon]] created a method of getting fingerprints off smooth surfaces and took a further step in the advance of dactyloscopy. ==Validity of fingerprinting for identification== {{Ref improve section|date=September 2010}} The validity of forensic fingerprint evidence has been challenged by academics, judges and the media. While fingerprint identification was an improvement on earlier [[anthropometry|anthropometric]] systems, the subjective nature of matching, despite a very low error rate, has made this forensic practice controversial.<ref name=Specter>[http://www.michaelspecter.com/2002/05/do-fingerprints-lie/ Specter, Michael "Do Fingerprints Lie" The New Yorker]</ref> Certain specific criticisms are now being accepted by some leaders of the forensic fingerprint community, providing an incentive to improve training and procedures. ===Criticism=== The words "[[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]]" and "[[Validity (statistics)|validity]]" have specific meanings to the scientific community. Reliability means that successive tests bring the same results. Validity means that these results are judged to accurately reflect the external criteria being measured. {{quote|"Although experts are often more
