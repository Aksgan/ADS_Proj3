It was headquartered in [[Coral Springs]], [[Florida]] still with offices in Los Angeles, New York, London and Singapore, the company systems control [[telecine]]s, [[virtual telecine]], [[digital]] mastering systems and [[film]] restoration processes. da Vinci Systems equipment was initially developed by VTA in 1982 for use by a Hollywood, FL, based production/post-production facility to alter and enhance colors from scanned film and video tape. The Wiz system was marketed to other post-production facilities, laying the foundation for the creation of the colorist and the post-production [[color suite]]. The control panel is based on track balls and other discrete controls that enable colorists to control the software that manipulates motion picture images. On September 8, 2009, Grant Petty, owner of Blackmagic Design, announced his intentions to buyout Da Vinci Systems Ltd. The purchase was completed by the following day. == Current products == *Digital Mastering System: '''Resolve''', Color correction, conforming and system. Mostly for [[digital intermediate]] use. *Control Panel: '''Impresario''', sophisticated and intuitive control surface for the '''Resolve''' and '''2K''' systems. *Color Correctors: '''2k''' and '''2k Plus''', High-end [[color grading]] and [[gamma correction]] system used to control telecine. *[[Virtual telecine]]: '''Splice''', interface for the 2k and the 2k Plus. *Film Restoration: '''Revival''', [[Film restoration]] to improve film quality of digital files. <gallery> Image:Dacp3.JPG|Joy ball control panel Image:Cc2kdui.JPG|2k Display </gallery> == History and technology == 1982 - Video Tape Associates (VTA) develops the Wiz.<br /> 1983 - Introduction of "The Wiz". Developed specifically by and for Video Tape Associates, Florida. The system controlled early telecines (RCA FR-35, Bosch FDL60) and offered basic primary and secondary color correction. The Editel group of post production facilities in the US evaluated the technology and asked that VTA build multiple systems for them. About 15 units were made and subsequently purchased by other post facilities across the US. "The Wiz" was essentially the prototype for what would become the da Vinci color corrector.<br /> 1984 - da Vinci Classic analog system was the most popular color corrector on the Fernseh's FDL 60 and Rank Cintel telecines (Mark 3 and URSA). It had customized external control panel with internal primary, secondary processing and an internal NTSC encoder. It ran on a [[Motorola]] 68000 Multi Bus 1 system computer. The program and color correction list were stored on a 20MB MMF hard disk, with backup to a 5.25" floppy disk.<br /> 1985 - VTA Technologies - a R&D division of VTA the video post facility - was formed. The da Vinci color corrector was born and other products were developed as well including an editor, machine control system, and routing system. The "da Vinci" was the only film-to-tape or tape-to-tape color correction system on the market that offered the capability to create a basic rectangular window shape isolating a secondary color correction. As the da Vinci product line evolved, the original da Vinci became known as the "da Vinci Classic".<br /> 1986 - Dynatech Video Group (Utah Scientific, ColorGraphics Systems, Quanta, among others) acquires da Vinci. Utah Scientific takes over da Vinci. Utah Scientific determines that all of da Vinci engineering should move to Salt Lake City.<br /> 1988 - VTA Technologies was purchased by Utah Scientific, a manufacturer of routing systems. da Vinci Systems later spun off of Utah Scientific, became its own entity, and was one of roughly eight video manufacturing companies in the porfolio of the Dynatech Video Group. Dynatech's name was later changed to Acterna.<br /> 1989 - da Vinci Renaissance was the analog system that followed the Classic analog system. It was similar to the above system, but ran on Motorola 68020 Multi Bus 1 system with a 3.5" Floppy. Options like kilo vectors were later available for the analog Renaissance. Kilovectors secondary color processing – more advanced than what was offered on the Classic - would become an industry standard function of secondary color isolation.<br /> 1990 - Parent company pressure to market a low cost da Vinci for "broadcasters and small post facilities" forces da Vinci to spend precious development resources to produce a stripped down telecine-only programmer called "Leonardo." To reduce cost, Leonardo uses a flat plate (vision mixer style) control panel, provides only scene-by-scene control of a telecine (similar to Cintel's Amigo) and offers no da Vinci color processing. As expected, the product is a failure and only one unit is ever sold. <br /> 1991 - da Vinci Renaissance 888 (with original interface, no Gui) – was introduced to the color grading marketing. The 888 was the first product in the world to offer 8:8:8 signal processing throughout. New groundbreaking features like Power Windows, Custom Curves
