world is in a constant state of recreation by God. The most famous proponent of the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] occasionalist doctrine was [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]], an 11th century theologian based in [[Baghdad]]. In ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', Al-Ghazali launched a philosophical critique against [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]]-influenced [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Islamic philosophers]] such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]. In response to the philosopher's claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes (God being, as it were, the Primary and Final Cause in an ontological and logical sense), Ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind habituated regularity. There is no independent necessitation of change and becoming, other than what God has ordained. To posit an independent causality outside of God's knowledge and action is to deprive Him of true agency, and diminish his attribute of power. In his famous example, when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire, but through God's direct intervention, a claim which he defended [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|using logic]]. In the 12th century, this theory was defended and further strengthened by the Islamic theologian [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], using his expertise in the [[Science in medieval Islam|natural sciences]] of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Islamic cosmology|cosmology]] and [[Physics in medieval Islam|physics]]. Because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the [[laws of nature]]. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) — in other words, his rational will. This is not, however, an essential element of an occasionalist account, and occasionalism can include positions where God's behaviour (and thus that of the world) is viewed as ultimately inscrutable, thus maintaining God's essential transcendence. On this understanding, apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such: they are simply God behaving in a way that ''appears'' unusual ''to us''. Given his transcendent freedom, he is not bound even by his own nature. Miracles, as breaks in the rational structure of the universe, can occur, since God's relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles. == Dualism == One of the motivations for the theory is the [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their [[essence]]s that one cannot affect the other. Thus, a person's mind cannot be the true cause of his hand's moving, nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish. In other words, the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa. Also, occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either, for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects. The will of God is taken to be necessary. The doctrine is, however, more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] school. There are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in [[René Descartes|Descartes's]] own writings, but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations.<ref>Daniel Garber, ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 299–305.</ref> However, many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position. In one form or another, the doctrine can be found in the writings of: [[Johannes Clauberg]], [[Claude Clerselier]], [[Gerauld de Cordemoy]], [[Arnold Geulincx]], [[Louis de La Forge]], [[François Lamy]], and (most notably), [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. == Hume's arguments, Berkeley and Leibniz == These occasionalists' negative argument, that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events, were echoed by certain arguments of [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] in the fourteenth century, and were later taken up by [[David Hume]] in the eighteenth. Hume, however, stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory, where God was called upon to replace such connections, complaining that 'We are got into fairy land [...] Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses.'<ref>David Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'', sect. 7, pt. 1.</ref> Instead, Hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself. [[George Berkeley]] was also inspired by the occasionalists, and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies. For Berkeley, bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds, and all such ideas were, as he put it, 'visibly inactive'.<ref>George Berkeley, ''A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', sect. 25.</ref> However, Berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power. [[G.W. Leibniz]] agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances, but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all. On the contrary, every simple substance had the power to produce changes in ''itself''. The illusion of transeunt efficient causation, for Leibniz, arose out of the [[pre-established harmony]] between the alterations produced immanently within different substances. ==Notes== <references/> ==See also== *[[Pre-established harmony]] ==External links== * [http://deoband.org/2010/03/aqida/allah-and-his-attributes/clearest-rational-argument-for-the-existence-of-a-creator/ Cosmological Argument aiming to establish Occasionalism] * [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11195b.htm ''Occasionalism'' from the Catholic Encyclopedia] [[Category:Theories of mind]] [[Category:Causality]] [[Category:Dualism]] [[ar:مناسبية]] [[de:Okkasionalismus]] [[et:Okasionalism]] [[es:Ocasionalismo]] [[fa:اصالت علت موقعی]] [[it:Occasionalismo]] [[nl:Occasionalisme]] [[pl:Okazjonalizm (filozofia)]] [[pt:Ocasionalismo]] [[ru:Окказионализм (философия)]] [[fi:Okkasionalismi]] [[sv:Ockasionalism]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27089</id> <title>Oceansat-2</title> <text>{{Infobox Spacecraft | Name = Oceansat-2 | Image = [[Image:Oceansat.jpg|250px]] | Caption = | Organisation = [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] | Major_Contractors = | Bus = IRS | Mission_Type = [[Oceanography]] | Decay = | Launch = 23 September 2009 | Carrier_Rocket = [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle|PSLV]]-C14 | Launch_Site = [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]] | NSSDC_ID = OCEANS2 | Mass = {{convert|960|kg}} | Orbit_regime = [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] | Orbit_regime = [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun-Synchronous]] [[Circular orbit]] |
