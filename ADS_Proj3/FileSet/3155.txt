what database, when, and the information viewed. When combined with traditional BI tools that examine service quality and customer care, NI creates a powerful nexus of subscriber and network data. == Use in telecommunications == Telcos, [[Internet_Service_Provider|Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]] and [[Mobile_network_operator|Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)]] are under increasing competitive pressures to move to [[smart pipe]] business models. The cost savings and revenue opportunities driving smart pipe strategies also apply to [[Network_Equipment_Provider|Network Equipment Providers]], [[Independent_software_vendor|Software Vendors]] and [[Systems_integrator|Systems Integrators]] that serve the industry. Because NI captures detailed information from the hundreds of IP applications that cross mobile networks, it provides the required visibility and analysis of user demand to create and deliver differentiating services, as well as manage usage once deployed. {| class="wikitable" |- !

NI enables faster and more sophisticated [[Audience_measurement|Audience Measurement]], User Behavior Analysis, [[Market_segment|Customer Segmentation]], and Personalized Services. Real-time network metrics are equally important for companies to deliver and manage services. NI classifies protocols and applications from layers 2 through 7, generates metadata for communication sessions, and correlates activity between all layers, applicable for [[Optimization_(computer_science)|Bandwidth & Resource Optimization]], [[Quality_of_service|Quality of Service (QoS)]], Content-Based Billing, [[Quality_of_experience|Quality of Experience (QoE)]], VoIP Fraud Monitoring and [[Regulatory_compliance|Regulatory Compliance]]. == Use in cloud computing == The economics and deployment speed of [[cloud computing]] is fueling rapid adoption by companies and government agencies.<ref name=higginbotham/><ref name=idc/><ref name=sullivan/> Among concerns, however, are risks of [[information security]], [[e-discovery]], [[regulatory compliance]] and [[auditing]]<ref name=sienkiewicz/><ref name=schwartz/><ref name=brodkin/>. NI mitigates the risks by providing [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]], [[Platform_as_a_service|Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] and [[Software_as_a_service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]] vendors with real-time [[situational awareness]] of network activity, and critical transparency to allay fears of potential customers. A vendor can demonstrate hardened network security to prevent [[Data_leakage_protection|Data Leakage]] or [[Data Theft]] and an irrefutable audit trail of all network transaction – communication and content – related to a customer’s account. == Use in government == NI extracts and correlates information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, providing [[situational awareness]] for [[Lawful_interception|Lawful Interception]] and [[Cyber_security|Cyber Security]]. Real-time data capture, extraction and analysis allow security specialists to take preventive measures and protect network assets in real time as a complement post-mortem analysis after an attack. == Use in business == Because NI combines real-time network monitoring with IP metadata extraction, it enhances the effectiveness of applications for [[Database_security|Database Security]], [[Database_audit|Database Auditing]] and Network Protection. The network visibility afforded by NI can also be used to build enhancements and next-generation solutions for [[Network_performance_management|Network Performance Management]], [[WAN_optimization|WAN Optimization]], [[Customer_experience_management|Customer Experience Management]], [[Content_filtering|Content Filtering]], and internal billing of networked applications. == References == {{reflist|refs= <ref name=partridge>{{cite web |author=Brian Partridge |title=Network Intelligence is Key to Profiting from Anywhere Demand |url=http://www.yankeegroup.com/ResearchDocument.do?id=53513 |date=2010-05-17 |publisher=Yankee Group Anchor Report |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> <ref name=bechetoile>{{cite web |author=Thibaut Bechetoille |title=The Everyday Relationship Between You and ‘Your’ Information: What’s Out There on the Internet |url=http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/topics/ip-communications/articles/52992-everyday-relationship-between-and-information-whats-out-there.htm |date=2009-03-25 |publisher=TMCnet |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> <ref name=sherrington>{{cite web |author=Simon Sherrington |title=Deep Packet Inspection Semi-Annual Market Tracker |url=http://www.heavyreading.com |date=2010-06 |publisher=Heavy Reading |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> <ref name=kishore>{{cite web |author=Aditya Kishore |title=Market Research: New Opportunity for Service Providers? |url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=159415 |date=2008-07-21 |publisher=Light Reading |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> <ref name=dee>{{cite news |author=Shireen Dee |title=Qosmos Network Intelligence Helps Development of Smart Pipe Solutions |url=http://caas.tmcnet.com/topics/caas-saas/articles/49997-qosmos-network-intelligence-helps-development-smart-pipe-solutions.htm |date=2009-02-03 |publisher=TMCnet |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> <ref name=messagelabs>{{cite web |title=MessageLabs Intelligence: 2008 Annual Security Report |url=http://www.messagelabs.com/mlireport/MLIReport_Annual_2008_FINAL.pdf |date=2009 |publisher=MessageLabs |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> <ref name=ironport>{{cite web |title=2008 Internet Security Trends |url=http://www.ironport.com/securitytrends/ |date=2008 |publisher=IronPort |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> <ref name=golson>{{cite web |author=Jordan Golson |title=A Brave New World: 700M New Net Users Seen By 2013 |url=http://gigaom.com/2009/07/21/a-brave-new-world-700m-new-net-users-seen-by-2013/#more-59899 |date=2009-07-21 |publisher=GigaOM |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> <ref name=higginbotham>{{cite web |author=Stacey Higginbotham |title=Will P2P Soon Be the Scourge of Mobile Networks? |url=http://gigaom.com/2009/07/21/will-p2p-soon-be-the-scourge-of-mobile-networks/#more-59491 |date=2009-07-21 |publisher=GigaOM |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> <ref name=idc>{{cite web |title=IDC Finds Cloud Computing Entering Period of Accelerating Adoption and Poised to Capture IT Spending Growth Over the Next Five Years |url=http://idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS21480708 |date=2008-10-20 |publisher=IDC |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> <ref name=sullivan>{{cite web |author=Tom Sullivan |title=More Cash for Cloud Computing in 2009 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/162157/more_cash_for_cloud_computing_in_2009.html |date=2008-03-29 |publisher=PC World |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> <ref name=sienkiewicz>{{cite web |author=Henry Sienkiewicz |title=DISA’s Cloud Computing Initiatives |url=http://www.govinfosecurity.com/podcasts.php?podcastID=229 |date=2008-04-30 |publisher=Government Information Security Podcasts |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> <ref name=schwartz>{{cite web |author=Ephraim Schwartz |title=The dangers of cloud computing |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/dangers-cloud-computing-839 |date=2008-07-07 |publisher=Info World |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> <ref name=brodkin>{{cite web |author=Jon Brodkin |title=Gartner: Seven cloud-computing security risks |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/070208-cloud.html |date=2008-07-02 |publisher=Info World |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> }} [[Category:Packets (information technology)]] [[Category:Computer network security]] [[Category:Deep packet inspection]] [[Category:Network analyzers]] [[Category:Intelligence (information gathering)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26241</id> <title>Neural Networks (journal)</title> <text>{{Primary sources|date=January 2010}} {{Infobox journal | cover = [[File:neuronet.gif]] | title = Neural Networks | editor = [[Stephen Grossberg]], [[Kenji Doya]], [[John G.
