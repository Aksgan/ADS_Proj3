because each digit was stored as 4 bits, the basic word operational cycle was 80 microseconds.<ref name=i12>''Introduction'', pg. 12</ref> The [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] was serial, so addition or subtraction took 240 microseconds,<ref name=i7>''Introduction'', pg. 7</ref> and overall processing speed was about 4,000 operations a second.<ref name=i3/> General multiplication or division took between 4 and 10 milliseconds, averaging 8. Although this is relatively slow, even for the era, Ferranti boasted that "The Sirius computer is nearly twice as fast as any other existing computer at its price, both as regards speeds of input and output and speeds of computation."<ref name=i7/> Operator input was provided in the form of a box with 10 columns of digits in the center with buttons for each number from 0 to 10. A single column on the left was used to select an accumulator, and the other then to input the ten digit value. There was a row of command keys on the right. Output consisted of two ten-digit displays using [[nixie tubes]] on the front of the machine, which also featured a large electric clock.<ref name=i7>See image, ''Introduction'', pg. 7</ref> All machines were also supplied with a Ferranti TR5 or TR7 photo-electric [[paper tape]] reader that read at 300 characters a second, and a slower [[Teletype]] paper tape printer (no speed is given, likely 110). Further [[input/output]] was offered through two input and two output channels, normally connected to a five-way switch box that allowed the operator to select which devices were fed to which channels. [[Magnetic tape]], [[punched card]], [[printer (computing)|printer]]s and other common I/O devices were supported through these channels.<ref name=i6/> The machine was designed to fit into small offices with a minimum of support. It required 5 amps of standard 50 Hz 230 V mains power, the only concern being that it was "free from excessive fluctuations."<ref name=i9>''Introduction'', pg. 9</ref> The case was only 10 inches deep, 4 foot 9 inches high, and 6 foot 9 inches across. This size was chosen to allow it to be placed directly behind a standard office desk, and the power supply was positioned so it projected into the knee-hole area. The reader and input box were normally placed on the desk, while the paper tape punch, a relatively large machine, was separate and sized to provide an even desktop.<ref>See image, ''Introduction'', pg. 3</ref> ==References== ====Notes==== {{reflist}} ====Bibliography==== {{refbegin}} * Gordon Scarrott, [http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/CCS/res/res12.htm#f "From Torsional Mode Delay Lines to DAP"], ''Computer Resurrection'', Number 12 (Summer 1995) * Peter Hall, [http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/CCS/res/res33.htm#d "A Management Perspective on Orion"], ''Computer Resurrection'', Number 33 (Spring 2004) * (''Introduction''), [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Ferranti/Ferranti.Sirius.1961.102646236.pdf "An introduction to the Ferranti Sirius Computer"], Ferranti, 1961 * John Wilson, "Ferranti: A History – Building a Family Business", Carnegie, 2000, ISBN 1859360807 * Barbara Ainsworth, [http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/about/projects/museum/papers/first-computer-at-monash-university-v7.pdf "Monash University's First Computer"], {{refend}} ====Further reading==== {{refbegin}} * [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Ferranti/Ferranti.Sirius2.1961.102646235.pdf "The advantages of the Ferranti Sirius Computer"], Ferranti, 1961 {{refend}} [[Category:Early computers]] [[Category:Transistorized computers]] [[Category:Magnetic amplifier computers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13453</id> <title>Ferret Data Visualization and Analysis</title> <text>[[Image:Ferret program.png|thumb|350px|Typical view of the Ferret program]] '''Ferret''' is an interactive computer [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] and analysis environment designed to meet the needs of [[oceanographer]]s and [[meteorologist]]s analyzing large and complex gridded data sets. Ferret offers a Mathematica-like approach to analysis; new variables may be defined interactively as mathematical expressions involving data set variables. Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully documented [[graphics]] are produced with a single command. It runs on most [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] systems using [[X Window]] for display, and on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] XP/NT/9x. ==External links== *[http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/ Ferret official site] [[Category:Meteorological data and networks]] [[Category:Earth sciences graphics software]] {{climate-stub}} [[ru:Ferret]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Ferret Data Visualization And Analysis}}</text> </page> <page> <id>13462</id> <title>Fg (Unix)</title> <text>{{lowercase}} '''fg''' is a [[job control (Unix)|job control]] command in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems that resumes execution of a suspended [[Process (computing)|process]] by bringing it to the foreground and thus redirecting its [[standard input]] and [[standard output|output streams]] to the user's [[computer terminal|terminal]].<ref name="man">[http://www.computerhope.com/unix/ufg.htm fg man page]</ref> fg is required to be included in an operating system in order for it to be [[POSIX]] compliant.<ref name="POSIX commands">[http://manuals.fujitsu-siemens.com/servers/bs2_man/man_us/posix/v6_0/posix_k.pdf POSIX (BS2000/OSD) - Commands User Guide]</ref> ==See also== *[[bg (Unix)|bg]], the complementary command that sends a process to the background *[[SIGCONT]] ==References== {{Reflist}} == External links == *{{man|cu|fg|SUS|run jobs in the foreground}} {{Unix commands}} [[Category:Standard Unix programs]] [[Category:Unix SUS2008 utilities]] {{Unix-stub}} [[ca:Fg (Unix)]] [[el:Fg (Unix)]] [[fr:Fg (Unix)]] [[pl:Fg (Unix)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13468</id> <title>Fiber (mathematics)</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], the '''fiber''' of a point ''y'' in ''Y'' under a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the [[inverse relation|inverse]] [[image (mathematics)|image]] of [[singleton (mathematics)|{''y''}]] under ''f'', that is, <math>f^{-1}(\{y\})=\{x \in X : f(x) = y\}</math> In a variant phrase, this is also called the '''fiber''' of ''f'' at ''y''.

(However, this terminology can also be used in such a way that we would speak of the preimages of ''subsets'' of Y; thus, we would say the preimage of {''y''} under ''f'') # The '''[[level set]]''' of ''y'' under ''f'', or the '''level set''' of ''f'' at ''y''. In algebraic geometry, the notion of a fiber of a morphism of schemes must be defined more carefully because in general, not every point is closed. In this case, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a morphism of schemes, the fiber of a point ''p'' in ''Y'' is the fibered product <math>X\times_Y \mathrm{Spec}\, k(p)</math> where ''k''(''p'') is the residue field at ''p''. In the same contexts, the spelling '''fibre''' is also seen. ==See also== * [[Fibration]] * [[Fiber bundle]] * [[Fiber product]] * [[Image (category theory)]] * [[Image (mathematics)]] * [[Inverse relation]] * [[Kernel (mathematics)]] * [[Preimage attack]] * [[Relation (mathematics)|Relation]] {{math-stub}} [[Category:Set theory]] [[ar:ليف (رياضيات)]] [[de:Urbild (Mathematik)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13479</id> <title>Fibre Channel over Ethernet</title> <text>'''Fibre Channel over Ethernet''' ('''FCoE''') is an encapsulation of [[Fibre Channel]] frames over [[Ethernet]] networks.
