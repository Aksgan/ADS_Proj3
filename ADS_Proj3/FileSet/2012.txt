Before the advent of [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], HyperCard was often used as a general-purpose presentation program. Examples of HyperCard applications include simple databases, "[[Choose Your Own Adventure|choose your own adventure]]"—type games, educational teaching aids, and [[WikiWikiWeb|the first wiki]]. Due to its rapid application design facilities, HyperCard was also sometimes used for prototyping of applications and sometimes even for version 1.0 implementations. Inside Apple, the QuickTime team was one of HyperCard's biggest customers. [[Image:Hypercard stack on Beethoven's Ninth 1.png|thumb|206px|right|Beethoven's Ninth stack]] A number of commercial software products were created in HyperCard, most notably the original version of the interactive game narrative ''[[Myst]]'', the [[Voyager Company]]'s [[Expanded Books]], and multimedia CD-ROMs of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony CD-ROM]], [[the Beatles]]' ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', and the Voyager ''[[MacBeth]]''. The prototype and demo of the popular game ''[[You Don't Know Jack]]'' was written in HyperCard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} [[Renault]], the French auto manufacturer, used it to control their inventory system.<ref>[http://www.itworld.com/offbeat/81942/ahead-their-time-nine-technologies-came-early?page=0,3 IT World: Ahead of their time: Nine technologies that came early]</ref><ref>[http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2002/08/54365 Wired Magazine: HyperCard Forgotten, but Not Gone]</ref> [[Activision]], which was until that time primarily a game company, saw HyperCard as an entry point into the business market. Changing their name to Mediagenic, they published several major HyperCard based applications, most notably [[Danny Goodman]]'s Focal Point, a personal information manager, and Reports For HyperCard, a program by Nine To Five Software that allowed users to treat HyperCard as a full-fledged database system with robust information viewing and printing features. The HyperCard-inspired SuperCard for a while included the "Roadster" plug-in that allowed stacks to be placed inside [[World Wide Web|Web]] pages and viewed by browsers with an appropriate browser plug-in. There was even a Windows version of this plug-in allowing computers other than Macintoshes to use the plug-in. ==History== HyperCard was created by [[Bill Atkinson]]. Work for it began in March 1985 under the name of WildCard (hence the [[creator code]] of 'WILD'). In 1986 Dan Winkler began work on [[HyperTalk]] and the name was changed to HyperCard for [[trademark]] reasons. It was initially released in August 1987, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if they promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the [[MacWorld Conference & Expo]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to guarantee maximum publicity. HyperCard was a huge hit almost instantly. Many people who thought they would never be able to program a computer started using HyperCard for all sorts of automation and prototyping tasks, a surprise even to its creator. Apple itself never seemed to understand what HyperCard's target market for users should be. Project managers found it was being used by a huge number of people, internally and externally. Bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in, demonstrating it had a wide variety of users. Since it was also free, it was difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improvements in the software. It was not lost on Apple or its mainstream developers that the power HyperCard gave to people could cut into the sales of ordinary shrink wrapped products.<ref>{{cite web | first = Douglas | last = Adams | year = 1989 | title = [[MacWorld]]: ''Frank the Vandal'', published in ''The Salmon of Doubt'' 2002 by Pan MacMillan. | url = http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-00-a.html }} <!-- ISBN -->></ref> ===HyperCard 2.0=== In late 1989, [[Kevin Calhoun]], then a HyperCard engineer at Apple, led an effort to upgrade the program. This resulted in 1990's '''HyperCard 2.0'''. The new version included an on-the-fly [[compiler]] that greatly increased performance of computationally intensive code, a new [[debugger]] and a number of improvements to the underlying HyperTalk language. At the same time HyperCard 2.0 was being developed, a separate group within Apple developed and in 1991 released "HyperCard IIGS", a version of HyperCard for the [[Apple IIGS]] system. Aimed mainly at the education market, HyperCard IIGS had roughly the same feature set as the 1.x versions of Macintosh HyperCard, while adding support for the color graphics capabilities of the IIGS. Although "stacks" (HyperCard program documents) were not binary-compatible, a translator program (itself a HyperCard stack) allowed stacks to be moved from one platform to the other. Then, Apple decided that most of its application software packages, including HyperCard, would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called [[Claris]]. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris, in the business of selling software for a profit, attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. They wrote a new "viewer only" version, the '''HyperCard Player''' which Apple distributed with the Macintosh operating system, while Claris sold the "full" version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the Mac. Despite the new revenue stream, Claris did little to market HyperCard. Development continued with minor upgrades, as well as the first failed attempt to create a third generation of HyperCard. During this period, HyperCard began losing market share. Without a number of important, basic features, HyperCard authors began moving to systems such as [[SuperCard]] and [[Macromedia Authorware]]. Nevertheless HyperCard continued to be popular and used for a widening range of applications, from the game ''[[The Manhole]]'', an earlier effort by the creators of ''[[Myst]]'', to corporate information services and many thousands in between.
