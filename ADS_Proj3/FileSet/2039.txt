over storage belonging to the operating system or another application. This permitted testing to be performed along with production. Because the key was only four bits in length, the maximum number of different applications that could be run simultaneously was 15. An additional option available on some models was fetch protection. It allowed the operating system to specify that blocks were protected from fetching as well as from storing. == Notes == <references group=NB/> == References == <!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist| refs= <ref name=A22-6821>{{cite manual | author = IBM | title = IBM System/360 Principles of Operation | id = A22-6821-0 | date = 1964 | Version = First Edition | url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/princOps/A22-6821-0_360PrincOps.pdf | separator = , }} </ref> <ref name=A22-6821-7>{{cite manual | author = IBM | title = IBM System/360 Principles of Operation | id = A22-6821-7 | ref = PoOps | date = September 1968 | Version = Eighth Edition | url = http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/princOps/A22-6821-7_360PrincOpsDec67.pdf | separator = , }} revised by {{cite manual | author = IBM | id = GN22-0354 | date = May 12, 1970 | separator = , }} and {{cite manual | author = IBM | id = GN22-0361 | date = June 8, 1970 | separator = , }} </ref> <ref name=A22-6843>{{cite manual | author = IBM | title = IBM System/360 I/O Interface Channel to Control Unit Original Equipment Manufacturers' Information | id = A22-6843-3 | version = Fifth Edition | url = http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/A22-6843-3_360channelOEM.pdf | separator = , }} </ref> <ref name=A22-6845>{{cite manual | author = IBM | title = IBM System/360 Direct Control and External Interrupt Features Original Equipment Manufacturers' Information | id = A22-6845-2 | version = Third Edition | separator = , }} </ref> <ref name=A22-6884>{{cite manual | author = IBM | title = IBM System/360 Model 65 Punctional Characteristics | id = A22-6884-3 | version = Fourth Edition | section = Appendix A.

IBM Tivoli Directory Server is a powerful, [[computer security|security-rich]] and standards-compliant enterprise directory for corporate [[intranet]]s and the [[Internet]]. Directory Server is built to serve as the identity data foundation for rapid development and deployment of [[Web application]]s and security and [[identity management]] initiatives by including strong management, replication and security features. Several [[authentication]] methods are available with IBM Tivoli Directory Server, beyond basic usernames and passwords. ITDS supports [[public key certificate|digital certificate-based authentication]], the [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]] (SASL), Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism MD5 (CRAM-MD5), and [[Kerberos]] authentication. IBM Tivoli Directory Server is a powerful LDAP infrastructure that provides a foundation for deploying comprehensive identity management applications and advanced software architectures. == History == During the product's inception, IBM named its product the IBM SecureWay Directory. This name wasn't changed until the Release 5.1 of the product and was then known as IBM Directory Server. With the next version of the product, Release 5.2, the name was again changed to include the [[Tivoli Software|Tivoli]] in it, and is now known as IBM Tivoli Directory Server. The latest release offered as of July 2007 is IBM Tivoli Directory Server 6.1. == Comments == IBM's directory server uses their DB2/UDB database as the underlying data store. In older versions, the impact of this was that it had comparatively poor performance, and required tuning of both the LDAP server and the UDB server to get any kind of respectable performance. As of the latest version (6.1), and possibly the one before (5.1), it is believed that the server's performance has been rectified. One of the main advantages of Tivoli Directory Server is that it runs on IBM [[mainframe computer|mainframes]]. Supported platforms also include Linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows. == Features == * Supports hundreds of millions of entries by leveraging advanced reliability and scalability of [[IBM DB2]] 9 technology and built-in proxy server * Extends an on demand identity infrastructure to leading business solutions through compliance
