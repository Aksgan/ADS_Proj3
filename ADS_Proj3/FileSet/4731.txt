In 2000, he launched the [[PyMOL]] open-source molecular viewer in an attempt to demonstrate the practical impact open source might have on discovery of new medicines. Since then, PyMOL has been widely adopted for [[molecular structure]] [[Scientific visualization|visualization]] within the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and at [[public sector]] [[research]] institutions. In 2003, DeLano founded [[DeLano Scientific LLC]] to [[commercialize]] [[PyMOL]] and conduct an [[experiment]] in the "[[laboratory]] of the [[market]]" regarding the commercial viability of an open source software company. His [[hypothesis]] was that open source software is intrinsically optimal for [[science]], and that scientific software companies which provide open source solutions will, through [[free market]] [[competition]], eventually displace companies that favor [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] solutions. DeLano died on 3 November 2009.<ref>http://www.jmdelano.com/</ref><ref>http://www.hmbreview.com/articles/2009/11/23/obituaries/doc4b0ac2cabac53732636665.txt</ref> ==Public quotes== {{Quote|Lack of access to effective software continues to be a major hindrance to scientific progress and therapeutic discovery.
