It was originally a [[tokusatsu]] and has since been adapted into [[manga]] and [[anime]]. Paying tribute to [[Astro Boy]], created by his mentor [[Osamu Tezuka]], Ishinomori used the stories of [[Carlo Collodi]]'s [[Pinocchio]] (which was also the basis for ''Astro Boy'') along with [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein]] as the basis for his [[science fiction]] action story.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The [[tokusatsu]] series from 1972 is especially popular in [[Hawaii]]. The complete DVD series is available in the west with English subtitles through [[JN Productions]]. The series was originally a live-action Tokusatsu series, as was its sequel Kikaider 01. A manga drawn in a style reminiscent of Osamu Tezuka's ''Astro Boy'' was eventually published, introducing Kikaider 00. A 13-episode anime and 4-episode OVA based on the manga were created in 2001. ==Media== ===Tokusatsu=== *'''''[[Android Kikaider]]''''' (1972) TV Series + one movie *'''''[[Kikaider 01]]''''' (1973) TV series *'''''[[Mechanical Violator Hakaider]]''''' (1995) movie ===Manga=== The manga series was serialized in [[Bessatsu Shōnen Sunday]] at the same time as the live action television series.

The original ''[[Android Kikaider]]'' series was one of the first [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] TV shows that added safety bumpers (seen at the end of each episode) which warned kids not to imitate the dangerous and impossible stunts performed by the title superhero. ==External links== *[http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-19385/ TVTome show details] * {{ann|anime|964|Kikaider}} {{Android Kikaider}} [[Category:Shotaro Ishinomori]] [[Category:Adventure anime and manga]] [[Category:Anime of 2000]] [[Category:Anime of 2003]] [[Category:Drama anime and manga]] [[Category:Fictional robots]] [[Category:Mecha anime and manga]] [[Category:Bandai Entertainment anime titles]] [[Category:Anime OVAs]] [[Category:Japanese television dramas]] [[ja:キカイダー]] [[pt:Kikaider]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20675</id> <title>Kilocore</title> <text>{{Update|date=September 2010}} {{Infobox CPU | name = Kilocore | image = | image_size = | caption = | produced-start = 2006 | produced-end = | slowest = 125 | fastest = | slow-unit = MHz | fast-unit = MHz | fsb-slowest = | fsb-fastest = | fsb-slow-unit = | fsb-fast-unit = | hypertransport-slowest = | hypertransport-fastest = | hypertransport-slow-unit = | hypertransport-fast-unit = | size-from = | size-to = | soldby = | designfirm = Rapport, [[IBM]] | manuf1 = [[IBM]] | core1 = | sock1 = | pack1 = | brand1 = | arch = [[PowerPC]] | microarch = | cpuid = | code = | numcores = 256, 1024, 1025 | l1cache = | l2cache = | l3cache = | application = }} '''Kilocore''', from [[Rapport Inc.]] and [[IBM]], is a high-performance, low-power [[multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] [[microprocessor]] that has 1,025 cores.

It allows high performance [[parallel computing|parallel processing]]. Rapport's first product to market is the KC256, with 256 8-bit processing elements.

The KC1025 has the PowerPC CPU, while the KC1024 has processing elements only.
