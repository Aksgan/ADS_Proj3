privacy took a back-seat to [[national security]] in most legislators' minds. Accordingly concerns of consumer privacy in the [[United States]] have tended to go unheard as questions of citizen privacy versus the state, and the development of a [[police state]] or [[carceral state]], have occupied advocates of strong privacy measures. Whereas it may have appeared prior to 2002 that commercial organizations and the consumer data they gathered were of primary concern, it has appeared since then in most [[developed nation]]s to be much less of a concern than [[political privacy]] and [[medical privacy]], e.g. as violated by [[biometrics]]. Indeed, people have been stopped at airports solely due to their political views recently (see [[No-fly list]]) and there appears to be little public will to stop practices of this nature. Privacy of body or habits may be 'dead', for all practical purposes, until political approaches or threats change. == Customer privacy == '''Customer privacy''' measures are those taken by commercial organizations to ensure that confidential customer data is not stolen or abused. Since most such organizations have a strong competitive incentive to retain an exclusive access to these data, and since customer trust is usually a high priority, most companies take some [[security engineering]] measures to protect customer privacy. However, these vary in effectiveness, and would not typically meet the much higher standards of [[client confidentiality]] applied by [[ethical code]]s or [[legal code]]s in [[banking]] or [[law]], nor [[patient privacy]] measures in medicine, nor rigorous "[[national security]]" measures in military and intelligence organizations. Since they operate for-profit, commercial organizations also cannot spend an unlimited amount on precautions and remain competitive - a commercial context tends to limit privacy measures, and to motivate organizations to share data when working in partnership. This has led to many [[moral hazard]]s and outrageous customer privacy violation incidents, and has led to consumer privacy laws in most countries, especially in the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. The [[United States]] has no such law and relies on corporate customer privacy to ensure consumer privacy in general. Some services, notably [[telecommunications]] including [[Internet]], imply collecting a vast array of information about user's activities in the course of things, and may also require consultation of these data to prepare bills. Telecom data must be kept for seven years in the US and Canada, to permit dispute and consultation about phone charges. [[Telecom regulation]] has always enforced a high level of confidentiality on these very sensitive customer communication bills and the underlying records. However, this approach has to a degree been outmoded as other industries also now gather sensitive data: Such common commercial measures as software-based [[customer relationship management]], [[rewards programs]] and [[target market]]ing tend to drastically increase the amount of information gathered (and sometimes shared). These very drastically increase privacy risks, and have accelerated the shift to regulation, rather than relying on corporate desire to preserve goodwill. Companies using coupon programs, e.g. Catalina Marketing, set up coupon printers in grocery stores. ==See also== {{ external media | align = right | width = 200px | image1 = [http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/privacy/dataeco_full.pdf Personal Data Ecosystem] }} * [[information technology management]] * [[management information systems]] * [[management]] * [[marketing]] * [[customer focus]] ==External links== {{Wikibooks|Legal and Regulatory Issues in the Information Economy}} * [http://www.privacyinternational.org Privacy International] * [http://ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change], [[FTC]] Staff Report {{Privacy}} [[Category:Electronic commerce]] [[Category:Marketing]] [[Category:Information technology management]] [[Category:Business law]] [[Category:Direct marketing]] [[Category:Privacy]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7919</id> <title>Container (data structure)</title> <text>{{for|the abstract notion of containers in [[Type theory]]|Container (Type theory)}} {{Merge | Collection (computing) | discuss=Talk:Container (data structure)#Merge proposal |date=October 2008 }} In [[computer science]], a '''container''' is a [[Class (computer science)|class]], a [[data structure]], or an [[abstract data type]] (ADT) whose instances are collections of other objects. In other words; They are used for storing objects in an organized way following specific access rules. Generally, container classes are expected to implement methods to do the following: * create a new empty container (constructor), * report the number of objects it stores (size), * delete all the objects in the container (clear), * insert new objects into the container, * remove objects from it, * provide access to the stored objects. There are two types of containers: value containers and reference containers. ''Value'' based containers store copies of the objects. Accessing an object also returns a copy of it. Modifying an external object after it has been inserted in the container will ''not'' affect the content of the container. ''Reference'' based containers only store pointers or references to the objects. Accessing an object returns a reference to it. Modifying an external object after it has been inserted in the container ''could'' result in modifying the content of the container (or more precisely, the object stored in the container). Containers are sometimes implemented in conjunction with [[iterator]]s. ==Examples of containers== Examples of containers include: * [[array data structure|array]] * [[List (computing)|list]] * [[Associative array|map]] * [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] * [[Set (computer science)|set]] * [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] * [[table (information)|table]] * [[tree (data structure)|tree]] * [[Vector (C++)|vector]] ==Containers in object-oriented programming== In [[object-oriented programming]], a '''container class''' is any [[class (computer science)|class]] that is capable of storing other [[object (computer science)|object]]s. Container classes usually implement some kind of [[data structure]], such as a [[list (computing)|list]], [[associative array|map]], [[set (computer science)|set]], [[array data structure|array]], or [[tree (data structure)|tree]]. A container class is usually able to store an arbitrary number of data items, i.e. the size of the collection is adjusted automatically. ==Graphic containers== [[Widget toolkit]]s use special [[Widget (computing)|widgets]] also called ''Containers'' to group the other widgets together ([[Window (computing)|windows]], [[Panel (computer software)|panels]], ...). Apart from their graphical properties, they have the same type of behavior as '''container classes''', as they keep a list of their child [[Widget (computing)|widgets]], and allow to add, remove, or retrieve [[Widget (computing)|widgets]] amongst their children. ==Implementations== {{Expand section|date=May 2007}} * Java: [[Java Collections Framework]]</li> * C++: [[C++ Standard Library|Standard C++ library]] or [[Standard Template Library]]</li> * .NET: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.aspx System.Collections (MSDN)]</li> *
