designs that would outperform the fastest members of the VAX family, DEC's [[cash cow]].<ref>John Hennessy, David Patterson and David Goldberg, [http://books.google.com/books?id=XX69oNsazH4C&pg=PA152 "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"], Morgan Kaufmann, 2003, pg. 152</ref> Constrained by the huge success of their [[VAX]]/[[OpenVMS|VMS]] products, which followed the proprietary model, the company was very late to respond to these threats. In the early 1990s, DEC found its sales faltering and its first layoffs followed. The company that created the minicomputer, a dominant networking technology, and arguably the first computers for personal use, had abandoned the "low end" market, whose dominance with the PDP-8 had built the company in a previous generation. Decisions about what to do about this threat led to infighting within the company that seriously delayed their responses. One group suggested that every possible development in the industry be poured into the construction of a new VAX family that would leapfrog the performance of the existing machines. This would limit the market erosion in the top-end segment, where [[profit margin]]s were maximized and DEC could continue to survive as a minicomputer vendor. This line of thought led, eventually, to the [[VAX 9000]] series, which were plagued with problems when they were first introduced in October 1989, already two years late.<ref>John Markoff, "Market Place; Digital Finally Follows a Trend", ''The New York Times'', 16 July 1990</ref> The problems took so long to work out, and the prices of the systems were so high, that DEC was never able to make the line the success they hoped. Others within the company felt that the proper response was to introduce their own RISC designs and use those to build new machines. However, there was little official support for these efforts, and no less than four separate small projects ran in parallel at various labs around the US. Eventually these were gathered into the [[DEC PRISM]] project, which delivered a credible 32-bit design with some unique features allowing it to serve as the basis of a new VAX implementation.<ref>Dileep Bhandarkar et al., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=63667 "High performance issue oriented architecture"], ''Proceedings of Compcon Spring '90'', pg. 153–160</ref> Infighting with teams dedicated to DEC's big iron made funding difficult, and the design was not finalized until April 1988, and then cancelled shortly thereafter.<ref>Mark Smotherman, [http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/prism.html "PRISM (Parallel Reduced Instruction Set Machine)"], Clemson University School of Computing, October 2009</ref> Another group concluded that new [[workstation]]s like those from [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Silicon Graphics]] would take away a large part of DEC's existing customer base before the new VAX systems could address the issues, and that the company needed its own Unix workstation as soon as possible. Fed up with slow progress on both the RISC and VAX fronts, a group in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] started a [[skunkworks project]] to introduce their own systems. Selecting the MIPS processor, which was widely available, introducing the new [[DECstation]] series with the model 3100 on 11 January 1989.<ref>Thomas Furlong et al., [http://www.dtjcd.vmsresource.org.uk/pdfs/dtj_v02-02_1990.pdf "Development of the DECstation 3100"], ''Digital Technical Journal'', Volume 2 Number 2 (Spring 1990), pg. 84–88</ref> These systems would see some success in the market, but were later displaced by similar models running the Alpha. ===32-bit MIPS and 64-bit Alpha systems=== [[Image:AlphaServer-2100-guts.jpg|thumb|Inside view of AlphaServer 2100.]] Eventually, in 1992, DEC launched the [[Alpha 21064|DECchip 21064]] processor, the first implementation of their [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] [[instruction set architecture]], initially named Alpha AXP (the "AXP" was a "non-acronym" and was later dropped). This was a [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] architecture (as opposed to the 32-bit [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architecture used in the VAX) and one of the first "pure" (not an extension of an earlier 32-bit architecture) 64-bit [[microprocessor]] architectures and implementations. The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch, and subsequent variants continued to do so into the 2000s. An AlphaServer SC45 supercomputer was still ranked #6 in the world in November 2004.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2004/11 www.top500.org Top 10 Supercomputing Sites, November 2004]</ref> Alpha-based computers (the DEC AXP series, later the [[AlphaStation]] and [[AlphaServer]] series) superseded both the VAX and MIPS architecture in DEC's product lines, and could run [[OpenVMS]], DEC [[OSF/1]] AXP (later, Digital Unix or Tru64 UNIX) and Microsoft's then-new operating system, [[Windows NT]]. In 1998, following the takeover by Compaq Computers, a decision was made that Microsoft would no longer support and develop Windows NT for the Alpha series computers, a decision that was seen as the beginning of the end for the Alpha series computers. DEC tried to compete in the Unix market by adding [[POSIX]]-compatibility features to the VAX/VMS operating system (becoming "OpenVMS") and by selling its own version of Unix ([[Ultrix]] on PDP-11, VAX and MIPS architectures; OSF/1 on Alpha), and began to advertise more aggressively. DEC was simply not prepared to sell into a crowded Unix market however, and the low end PC-servers running NT (based on [[Intel]] processors) took market share from Alpha-based computers. DEC's workstation and server line never gained much popularity beyond former DEC customers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ===StrongARM=== In the mid-1990s, Digital Semiconductor collaborated with [[ARM Limited]] to produce the [[StrongARM]] microprocessor. This was based in part on ARM7 and in part on DEC technologies like Alpha, and was targeted at [[embedded system]]s and portable devices. It was highly compatible with the ARMv4 architecture and was very successful, competing effectively against rivals such as the [[SuperH]] and [[MIPS architecture]]s in the [[portable digital assistant]] market. [[Microsoft]] subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their [[Pocket PC]] platform. In 1997, as part of a lawsuit settlement, the [[StrongARM]] intellectual property was sold to [[Intel]]. They continued to produce [[StrongARM]], as well as developing it into the [[XScale]] architecture. Intel subsequently sold this business to [[Marvell Technology Group]] in 2006. ===Designing solutions=== Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, Digital was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (Digital Network Architecture – predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture – disks/tapes/controllers), and its "dumb terminal" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.<ref>For in-depth articles regarding Digital technologies, refer to the archived [http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/dtj/past.htm Digital Technical Journal]</ref> ===Final years===
