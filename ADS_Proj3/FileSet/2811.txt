Sussman asked his teacher. ::"So that the room will be empty." ::At that moment, Sussman was enlightened. <blockquote> What I actually said was, "If you wire it randomly, it will still have preconceptions of how to play. But you just won't know what those preconceptions are." --Marvin Minsky </blockquote> Minsky has three children: Henry Minsky, Julie Minsky and Margaret Minsky, who is herself a Doctor of Philosophy from MIT, with a special interest in [[Haptic technology]].<ref>[http://margaretminsky.com/ Margaret Minksy's website]</ref> He also has four grandchildren: Gigi Minsky, Harry Minsky, Charlotte Minsky and Miles Steele. ==Selected works== *''Neural Nets and the Brain Model Problem'', Ph.D. dissertation, Princeton University, 1954.
