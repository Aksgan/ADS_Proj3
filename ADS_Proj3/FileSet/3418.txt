Truprevent Technologies offers generic protection against many of the techniques most commonly used by new malware, and policies and rules are developed based on the new vulnerabilities that appear every day. Due to the vast amount of new malware that appears every day in 2007 PandaLabs detected an average of 3,000 new samples a day,<ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=9077=The number of new strains of malware that appeared in 2007 increased tenfold with respect to the previous year]</ref> which has risen to 35,000 in 2009, Panda Security decided to develop a protection system that would automatically detect, scan and classify malware in real time. This security model presented in 2007 was called “Collective Intelligence” and is the basis of the new solutions that offer security from the cloud. This technology is implemented in its 2009 and 2010 antivirus products for home users and in the new Panda Cloud Antivirus, which the company has classified as the first antivirus in History that provides protection from the cloud <ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=9336=Panda Security launches its 2009 products, the first antivirus in history to use Collective Intelligence and protect from the cloud]</ref> These antivirus products only include the information about malware samples that cause most infections at any given moment, while the rest of the information is stored in Panda’s knowledge base. The antivirus connects to this knowledge base whenever necessary. This system is designed to offer real-time protection against thousands of new malware samples, use the community knowledge base to offer further protection and not to consume computer resources.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-JfW4Ut8kg How Collective Intelligence works and security from the cloud works]</ref> == Tests == In the February 2010 tests conducted by AV Comparatives, Panda's detection rate ranked 3rd of the 20 vendors tested, its [[false positive]] rate ranked 16th.<ref>[http://www.av-comparatives.org/images/stories/test/ondret/avc_report25.pdf Anti-Virus Comparative No. 25, February 2010]</ref> Panda has not been tested by [[Virus Bulletin]] since 2002<ref>http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/results?vendor=VE13</ref>.

It proposes that the mind consists of a collection of [[Daemon (computer software)|demon]]s, each responsible for a single task. Selfridge's architecture would inspire later developments in [[artificial intelligence]], such as [[production system]]s and [[intelligent agent]]s. Pandemonium theory was developed by [[John Jackson]] in 1987 to include the stadium metaphor. Demons are usually dormant and reside in the stands. Active demons reside in the arena. Demons in the arena spread activity to demons in the stands which may result in demons being summoned to the arena. Active demons suffer a decay in activity over time and if their activity drops below a threshold they may be returned to the stands. Connections between demons engage in a [[Hebbian learning]] scheme, with the additional condition that long active demons are connected to newer demons with a stronger connection than the vice versa connection. ==References== *Wright, Robert.
