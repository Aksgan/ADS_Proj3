Tags were introduced in AmigaOS 2.0 because: {{Quote|Tags make it possible to add new parameters to system functions without interfering with the original parameters.  They also make specifying parameter lists much clearer and easier.|<nowiki/>|{{cite book|title=Amiga ROM Kernal Reference Manual: Libraries|edition=3rd edition|ISBN=0-201-56774-1|url=http://cataclysm.cx/random/amiga/reference/Libraries_Manual_guide/node0496.html|pages=867}} }} A number of [[Third-party software component|third-party]] software libraries for AmigaOS also use tags extensively. ===Example=== {| |- align=center !AmigaOS 1.3 !AmigaOS 2.0+ |- valign=top |<source lang="C"> struct Window *wnd; struct NewWindow nw = {         10, 10,         100, 100,         0, 1,         IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW,         WFLG_SIZEGADGET | WFLG_DRAGBAR | WFLG_DEPTHGADGET | WFLG_CLOSEGADGET | WFLG_ACTIVATE,         NULL, NULL,         "WikiWindow",         NULL, NULL,         0, 0,         640, 400,         WBENCHSCREEN }; wnd = OpenWindow(&nw); </source> |<source lang="C"> struct Window *wnd; wnd = OpenWindowTags(NULL,         WA_Left, 10, WA_Top, 10,         WA_Width, 100, WA_Height, 100,         WA_IDCMP, IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW,         WA_Flags, WFLG_SIZEGADGET | WFLG_DRAGBAR | WFLG_DEPTHGADGET | WFLG_CLOSEGADGET | WFLG_ACTIVATE,         WA_Title, "WikiWindow",         WA_PubScreenName, "Workbench",         TAG_DONE ); </source> |} Note how the code without tags is obscure (for example, <code>0, 1</code> define window colors) while the code with tags is self-documenting. Note also that fewer parameters have to be defined with tags than are in the structure, as OpenWindowTags will fall back to default parameters. ===Implementation=== {{Expand section|date=October 2008}} AmigaOS provides functions for tag handling in its <code>utility.library</code>. ==In general== An advantage of tags is that they ease the work with [[default (computer science)|default arguments]] since the programmer doesn't have to specify them or their substitutes. From this follows another advantage, ease of achieving of both [[forward compatibility|forward]] and [[backward compatibility]] with external [[library (computing)|libraries]]: a program written for an older version of the library will work with a newer one, since the newer library will simply set all the parameters not provided by the program to their default values; and a program written for a newer version of the library will still work with the older version, since the older library will simply pay no attention to the newly-introduced tags. A disadvantage of tags is that their processing is slower than simply reading data from a [[data structure|structure]] or the [[stack (data structure)|stack]]. Additionally, [[compile time]] [[type checking]] is lost. ==See also== * [[Named parameter]] ==External links== * [http://tbs-software.com/guide/index.php?guide=autodocs.doc%2Futility.doc utility.library autodoc] * [http://cataclysm.cx/random/amiga/reference/Libraries_Manual_guide/node00B4.html Amiga ROM Kernal Reference Manual: Libraries - Tag index] {{AmigaOS}} [[Category:AmigaOS]] [[Category:MorphOS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36801</id> <title>Taguchi methods</title> <text>'''Taguchi methods''' are [[statistics|statistical]] methods developed by [[Genichi Taguchi]] to improve the quality of manufactured goods, and more recently also applied to, engineering,<ref>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2008.03.021 ROSA, Jorge Luiz ; ROBIN, Alain ; SILVA, M.

That said, professional statisticians have criticized some of Taguchi's designs, as being less efficient than the traditional designs or [[optimal design]]s of [[response surface methodology]]. At the same time, the industrial adaption of even inefficient Taguchi designs demonstrated a market for response-surface methodology, which had been neglected by statistical researchers and textbooks. Taguchi's successes forced many improvements on statistical textbooks, which had to become more accessible to
