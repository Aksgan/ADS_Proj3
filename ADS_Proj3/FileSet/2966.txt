define ''truth in a model'': * ''w'' ⊨ ¬P if and only if ¬(''w'' ⊨ P) * ''w'' ⊨ (P & Q) if and only if ''w'' ⊨ P and ''w'' ⊨ Q * ''w'' ⊨ <math>\Box</math>P if and only if for every element ''v'' of ''G'', if ''w'' ''R'' ''v'' then ''v'' ⊨ P * ''w'' ⊨ <math>\Diamond</math>P if and only if for some element ''v'' of ''G'', it holds that ''w'' ''R'' ''v'' and ''v'' ⊨ P According to these semantics, a truth is ''necessary'' with respect to a possible world ''w'' if it is true at every world that is accessible to ''w'', and ''possible'' if it is true at some world that is accessible to ''w''. Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation ''R'', which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility. For example, we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light, but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so. Using the accessibility relation we can translate this scenario as follows: At all of the worlds accessible to our own world, it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light, but at one of these accessible worlds there is ''another'' world accessible from ''those'' worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light. It should also be noted that the definition of <math>\Box</math> makes vacuously true certain sentences, since when it speaks of "every world that is accesible to w" it takes for granted the usual mathematical interpretation of the word "every" (see [[vacuous truth]]). Hence, if a world w doesn't have any accesible worlds, any sentence beginning with <math>\Box</math> is true. The different systems of modal logic are distinguished by the properties of their corresponding accessibility relations. There are several systems that have been espoused (often called ''frame conditions''). An accessibility relation is: * ''reflexive'' iff ''w'' ''R'' ''w'', for every ''w'' in ''G'' * ''symmetric'' iff ''w'' ''R'' ''v'' implies ''v'' ''R'' ''w'', for all ''w'' and ''v'' in ''G'' * ''transitive'' iff ''w'' ''R'' ''v'' and ''v'' ''R'' ''q'' together imply ''w'' ''R'' ''q'', for all ''w'', ''v'', ''q'' in ''G''. * ''serial'' iff, for each ''w'' in ''G'' there is some ''v'' in ''G'' such that ''w'' ''R'' ''v''. * ''euclidean'' iff, for every ''u'',''v'' and ''w'', ''u'' ''R'' ''w'' and ''v'' ''R'' ''w'' implies ''u'' ''R'' ''v'' The logics that stem from these frame conditions are: *''K'' := no conditions *''D'' := serial *''T'' := reflexive *''S4'' := reflexive and transitive *''S5'' := reflexive, symmetric, transitive and Euclidean S5 models are reflexive transitive and euclidean. The accessibility relation R is an equivalence relation. The relation ''R'' is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. It is interesting to note how the euclidean property along with reflexivity yields symmetry and transitivity. We can prove that these frames produce the same set of valid sentences as do any frames where all worlds can see all other worlds of ''W''(i.e., where ''R'' is a "total" relation). This gives the corresponding ''modal graph'' which is total complete (i.e, no more edge (relation) can be added). For example, in S4: :: ''w'' ⊨ <math>\Diamond</math>P if and only if for some element ''v'' of ''G'', it holds that ''v'' ⊨ P and ''w'' ''R'' ''v''. However, in S5, we can just say that :: ''w'' ⊨ <math>\Diamond</math>P if and only if for some element ''v'' of ''G'', it holds that ''v'' ⊨ P. We can drop the accessibility clause from the latter stipulation because it is trivially true of all S5 frames that ''w'' ''R'' ''v''. All of these logical systems can also be defined axiomatically, as is shown in the next section. For example, in S5, the axioms P → <math>\Box</math><math>\Diamond</math>P, <math>\Box</math>P → <math>\Box</math><math>\Box</math>P, and <math>\Box</math>P → P (corresponding to ''symmetry'', ''transitivity'' and ''reflexivity'', respectively) hold, whereas at least one of these axioms does not hold in each of the other, weaker logics. ===Axiomatic systems=== The first formalizations of modal logic were axiomatic. Numerous variations with very different properties have been proposed since [[C. I. Lewis]] began working in the area in 1910. Hughes and Cresswell (1996), for example, describe 42 normal and 25 non-normal modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes some systems Hughes and Cresswell omit. Modern treatments of modal logic begin by augmenting the [[propositional calculus]] with two unary operations, one denoting "necessity" and the other "possibility". The notation of [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]], much employed since, denotes "necessarily ''p''" by a prefixed "box" (<!--'''[]p'''--> <math>\Box p </math>) whose scope is established by parentheses. Likewise, a prefixed "diamond" (<!--'''<>p'''--><math>\Diamond p</math>) denotes "possibly ''p''". Regardless of notation, each of these operators is definable in terms of the other: * <!--[]p--><math>\Box p</math> (necessarily ''p'') is equivalent to <!-- ~<>~p --><math>\neg \Diamond \neg p </math> ("not possible that not-''p''") * <!-- <>p --> <math>\Diamond p </math> (possibly ''p'') is equivalent to <!-- ~[]~p --> <math>\neg \Box \neg p </math> ("not necessarily not-''p''") Hence <math>\Box</math> and <math>\Diamond</math> form a [[duality (mathematics)#Duality in logic and set theory|dual pair]] of operators. In many modal logics, the necessity and possibility operators satisfy the following analogs of [[de Morgan's laws]] from [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]: :"It is '''not necessary that''' ''X''" is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to "It is '''possible that not''' ''X''". :"It is '''not possible that''' ''X''" is logically equivalent to "It is '''necessary that not''' ''X''". Precisely what axioms and rules must be added to the [[propositional calculus]] to create a usable system of modal logic is a matter of philosophical opinion, often driven by the theorems one wishes to prove; or, in computer science, it is a matter of what sort of computational or deductive system one wishes to model. Many modal logics, known collectively as [[normal modal logic]]s, include the following rule and axiom: * '''N''', ''Necessitation Rule'': If ''p'' is a [[theorem]] (of any system
