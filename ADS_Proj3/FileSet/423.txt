comparison, and statistical features.<ref>http://www.bsreview.org/blog/freeware.html?postTabs=2</ref> ==Overview== Bible Analyzer is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] with a [[wxPython]] [[GUI]]. According to its author it was first conceived in 2003 to address areas in Bible<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible</ref> study and analysis that are largely untouched among other Bible software programs. Primarily features such as ''Bible text comparison, proximity range searches,'' and ''textual statistical analysis.'' Versions 1.0 through 2.2 concentrated on these features. The version 3 series greatly expanded them and added other features such as a dedicated cross-reference panel, "Related Verse" Searches, Text-To-Speech and Audio features, etc. Version 4.0 includes a major updating of the interface and also a Harmony/Parallel Text Generator, advanced Related Phrase Search, Multiple Bible Search capabilities, exporting of study data to the "MultiWindow," etc. ==Module Format== Bible Analyzer utilizes Bible, Commentary, Dictionary, Book and Image modules in the [[open-source]] [[SQLite]] database format. Users familiar with SQLite can easily create custom modules with the built in "Module Creator." Bible Analyzer has in its module format such works as [[E. W. Bullinger]]'s Companion Bible Notes and Appendices in fully searchable, digital format, the 11 volume Understanding The Bible Commentary<ref>http://www.northstarministries.com/understanding.htm</ref> by David Sorenson,<ref>http://www.BibleAnalyzer.com/modules.html</ref> Books and Charts by [[Clarence Larkin]] such as Dispensational Truth, the 23 volume Pulpit Commentary, and more. Bible Analyzer is updated regularly and a CD-Rom with over 800MB of data is available. ==History of Bible Analytics== The Pioneer of Bible Analytics was, Thomas Hartwell Horne<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hartwell_Horne</ref> (1780â€“1862), he was a theologian, and librarian. He was born in London and educated at Christ's Hospital. His work named, 'Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures'<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Scriptures</ref> that was published in 1818 was the beginning of the Bible Statistics. Horne also produced a "Tree Full of Bible Lore," a tree-shaped text of statistics on the Bible, in which he counted the number of books, chapters, verses, words, and even letters. He ended this tree with "It the Bible contains knowledge, wisdom, holiness and love." This "tree" is repoduced in the third series of Ripley's paperbacks<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley%27s_Believe_It_or_Not!</ref>, originally published hardbound in 1949. Although he was very wrong with his statistics, it was the beginning... ==Performance== There are structures of Bible Analytics within the Bibles. <br />Bible Analytics studies the structure of occurrence: <br /> <br />Comparisons of the Bibles <br />The Old Testament <br />The New Testament <br />Number of books <br />The Total Bible <br />The Frequency & <br />The Amount of occurs & <br />Where they occur at... <br /> <br />Chapters <br />Verses <br />Words <br />Letters <br />Punctuations <br />Are The Most Popular Statistics <br /> <br />The Bible Analyzer<ref>http://www.bibleanalyzer.com/</ref> can give the statistics of every Bible & Compare them. <br />The long time desire of the Biblical Manuscript<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript</ref> Authors, Bible Critics<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_criticism</ref>, and the Bible Scholars<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_studies</ref> alike... == Reviews == Bible Software Review, [http://www.bsreview.org/blog/freeware.html?postTabs=2 ''Review of Bible Analyzer version 3.5.2,''] November 22, 2008. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Sisterlinks}} * [http://www.bibleanalyzer.com/ Official Web Page] * [http://www.preservedwords.com/ Home Page of author, Timothy Morton] == See also == {{Col-begin}} {{Col-break}} === Biblical scholarship and analysis === * [[Dating the Bible]] * [[Textual criticism]] * [[Historical criticism]] * [[Documentary hypothesis]] * [[Synoptic problem]] * [[Biblical manuscripts]] * [[Internal consistency and the Bible]] * [[Mosaic authorship]] * [[Authorship of the Johannine works]] * [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles]] * [[Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible]] * [[Apocrypha]] * [[Dead sea scrolls]] * [[Nag hammadi library]] * [[Biblical archaeology]] {{Col-break}} {{Portal|Bible}} === Perspectives on the Bible === * [[Bibliolatry]] * [[Calvin's view of Scripture]] * [[Jewish Biblical exegesis]] * [[Islamic view of the Bible]] * [[Biblical narratives and the Qur'an]] * [[Criticism of the Bible]] * [[Gnosticism and the New Testament]] * [[Good news (Christianity)]], concerning the content of the Bible's message about [[Jesus]] * [[Christianity and Judaism]] * [[Biblical law in Christianity]] * [[Bible prophecy]] * [[Biblical inerrancy]] * [[New Testament view on Jesus' life]] * [[Ten Commandments]] * [[Parsha]] * [[Ritual Decalogue]] * [[Jewish messianism]] * [[Summary of Christian eschatological differences]] * [[Bibliomancy]] is the use of random readings from a book for divination.

The term was probably introduced in 1991 by ''Paul Heckbert''{{Ref|endnote_veach1997_a}}. Most often it is used to name the general mathematical function which describes the way in which the light is scattered by a surface. However in practice this phenomenon is usually split into the reflected and transmitted components, which are then treated separately as '''BRDF''' ('''[[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function]]''') and '''BTDF''' ('''Bidirectional transmittance distribution function'''). [[Image:BSDF05 800.png|thumb|right|280px|BSDF: BRDF + BTDF]] * '''BSDF''' is a superset and the generalization of the '''BRDF''' and '''BTDF'''. The concept behind all BxDF functions could be described as a black box with the inputs being any two angles, one for incoming (incident) ray and the second one for the outgoing (reflected or transmitted) ray at a given point of the surface.
