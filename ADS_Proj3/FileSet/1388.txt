track length of "Autonomous Navigation" was several kilometres. Additionally, there were three versions of the "Reconnaissance and Surveillance" setting. The first was in urban area which included intrusion of buildings. The second was placed in non urban area with higher requirements on the off-road mobility of the vehicles and the third one concentrated on the combination of [[UGV]]s and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]]. All scenario run times were limited to 45 minutes. The result of C-ELROB 2007 was, that there are some semi-autonomous assistance functions ready. Most vehicles managed to drive in difficult outdoor terrain, too. But some of the teams were surprised by reality and had severe problems with radio communication and battery power. There were 14 participating teams in total. Nine of the teams came from Germany, two from Poland and one from Finland, Swiss and Portugal, respectively. ==== 2009 ==== [[Image:elrob2009.jpg|thumb|300px|ELROB 2009 Logo]] The C-ELROB 2009 took place in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]], 15-17 June. The area of the trials was a former zoo and a part of a public forest near the [[University of Oulu]]. The scenarios were very similar to the ones on the military ELROB 2008. This was due to public demand of the participants who requested more continuity in the scenarios to have the chance to catch up with the requirements of a scenario and not be confronted with different scenarios and requirements each year. Therefore there were the "Reconnaissance and Surveillance", "Autonomous Navigation", "Camp Security" and "Transport Mule" scenarios. Additionally, all points of interest and the intruders in the "Camp Security" scenario were marked with [[ERICards]], because [[computer vision]] was no focus of the trials. The run time of the scenarios was limited to 60 minutes. ELROB 2009 was attended by ten teams. Seven teams came from Germany and one from France, Poland and Finland, each. == Military ELROB == The military ELROB (short M-ELROB) has a sharp focus on short-term realisable systems which are able to fulfil the requirements of common military tasks. Therefore the scenarios simulate real world missions as close as possible which is reflected by the fact that members of the [[Bundeswehr]] are part of the organisation committee. The organisers do not place artificial constraints on the scenarios regardless of the abilities of the robots. One example was the very bad radio communication encountered during M-ELROB 2008, because most trials took place in the forest. M-ELROB is explicitly designed to assess current technology to solve real world problems at hand. M-ELROB is a tool to bring together users, researchers and industry. === Scenarios === The scenarios of the M-ELROBs correspond to real military situations like Reconnaissance and Surveillance missions. In general the scenarios should be mastered with maximum autonomy, although teleoperation is allowed. The location for the scenario is kept secret until short before the start of the trials and therefore the teams have no chance to generate a detailed map of the area (for example with laser range finders) ahead of their run. The location is described to the participants by GPS coordinates and aerial imagery. ==== Reconnaissance and Surveillance ==== The task in the "Reconnaissance and Surveillance" setting is to reach a given area and explore it. During the exploration special points of interest (normally marked) need to be detected and localized. The position of this points and a photograph should be given to the judges as results of the run. If possible, the robot should return to its starting position, when it finished exploring. ==== Autonomous Navigation ==== The aim of the "Autonomous Navigation" scenario is to follow a given route mostly autonomous. The route will be some kilometers in length. During the traversal of the route points of interest (usually marked) need to be found and localised. Again the position and a photograph of the points of interest need to be given to the judges as results of the run. ==== Camp Security ==== The "Camp Security" scenario requires the robots to guard a predefined area for the time of the scenario run. During the run (marked) intruders will be entering the area and need to be detected, tracked and pursued. An image of the intruder and its location while it was captured need to be given to the judges as result. Capturing means "drive near the intruder and stop", then the captured intruder will leave the area. ==== Transport Convoy ==== The "Transport Convoy" mission requests at least two vehicles to be navigated, as fast as possible, to a target position which is several kilometres away. A payload of about 50 kg needs to be transported. At most one of the vehicles may be controlled by human, which may reduce the task for the robot to autonomously follow a vehicle. Of course two (or more) completely autonomously vehicles are better. ==== Transport Mule ==== The "Transport Mule" scenario simulates a shuttle service. The robot should install a shuttle service between two given points as autonomously as possible and shuttle between those points as often as possible during the time of its scenario run. === Past military ELROBs === ==== 2006 ==== [[Image:elrobl.jpg|thumb|300px|ELROB 2006 Logo]] The M-ELROB 2006 took place in Hammelburg on the training area of the infantry school of the German Forces, 15-18 May. M-ELROB 2006 was the first ELROB and was utilized to paint a picture of the possibilities of modern robotics. The scenarios were concentrated on navigation. One was located in urban terrain which includes intrusion into buildings. The other scenario took place outdoors on a more challenging ground with mud and very steep slopes. Both scenarios fall into the category "Reconnaissance and Surveillance", although there were no points of interest that needed to be found. The time limit was 30 minutes. The result of M-ELROB 2006 was disillusioning. Most of the teams had to fight hardware failures and all were remote controlled via WLAN. All in all 18 teams were participating, eleven German teams, three from the UK, two from Swiss and one from Portugal and France, each. ==== 2008 ==== [[Image:ELROB
