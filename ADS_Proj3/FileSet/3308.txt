It was also the name of the project initiated by Sun to build a developer and user community around the software.

Solaris is a version of [[UNIX System V]] [[UNIX System V#SVR4|Release 4]] (SVR4), jointly developed by Sun and [[AT&T]] to merge features from several existing [[Unix]] systems. It was licensed by Sun from [[Novell]] to replace [[SunOS]].<ref> {{cite press release |publisher = [[Sun Microsystems]] |date = September 4, 1991 |title = SunSoft introduces first shrink-wrapped distributed computing solution: Solaris |url = http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/presskits/25years/pr.html#solaris |accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}</ref> Planning for OpenSolaris started in early 2004.

The first part of the Solaris code base to be open sourced was the Solaris Dynamic Tracing facility (commonly known as [[DTrace]]), a tool that aids in the analysis, debugging, and tuning of applications and systems. DTrace was released under the CDDL on January 25, 2005 on the newly launched ''opensolaris.org'' website.<ref> {{cite web |author=Michael Singer |date=January 25, 2005 |title=Sun Cracks Open Solaris |url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3463621 |publisher=InternetNews.com |accessdate=2010-04-12 }}</ref> The bulk of the Solaris system code was released on June 14, 2005. There remains some system code that is not open sourced, and is available only as pre-compiled [[Binary file|binary]] files. To direct the newly-fledged project, a Community Advisory Board was announced on April 4, 2005: two were elected by the pilot community, two were employees appointed by Sun, and one was appointed from the broader [[free software community]] by Sun. The members were [[Roy Fielding]], Al Hopper, Rich Teer, Casper Dik, and [[Simon Phipps (programmer)|Simon Phipps]]. On February 10, 2006 Sun approved ''The OpenSolaris Charter'', which reestablished this body as the independent OpenSolaris Governing Board.<ref> {{cite web |author=Simon Phipps |date=February 10, 2006 |title=OpenSolaris Independence Day |url=http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=opensolaris_independence_day |publisher=[[Sun Microsystems]] |accessdate=2009-11-21 }}</ref> The task of creating a governance document or "constitution" for this organization was given to the OGB and three invited members: [[Stephen Hahn]] and Keith Wesolowski (developers in Sun's Solaris organization) and Ben Rockwood (a prominent OpenSolaris community member).
