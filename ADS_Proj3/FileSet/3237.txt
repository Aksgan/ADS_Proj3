are only four, not five — rejoin their brethren. D'Anna then accompanies Adama to the Galactica, declaring to the assembled crew (and the Final Four, all of whom are present); [[Lee Adama]], acting as president, assures her he will make no effort to stop the Four from leaving if they so choose; [[Tory Foster]] acts immediately, leaving with D'Anna under the excuse of delivering Roslin's medication to her. The others hesitate, and D'Anna soon begins executing hostages. After [[Saul Tigh|Col. Tigh]] reveals himself, as well as [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Samuel Anders|Anders]], D'Anna responds to Lee's threat to execute them by targeting the Colonial Fleet with the basestar's nuclear weapons. Baltar successfully persuades her to stand down, and Lee shortly thereafter reveals to her Starbuck's discovery of a Colonial signal apparently coming from Earth. Though at first hesitant, convinced the humans would never forgive the Cylons and their conflict would never end, she agrees to Lee's proposal they go to Earth together. She is a member of the landing party that discovers the planet to be an irradiated, post-apocalyptic wasteland. At the conclusion of "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]", [[Saul Tigh]] approaches D'Anna to tell her the fleet is about to leave. D'Anna chooses to stay behind on Earth. She tells him: "You know all this is just going to happen again and again... and again. So I'm getting off this merry-go-round." She adds she would rather die on Earth with her ancestors than at [[John Cavil|Cavil]]'s hands in the cold and dark of space. D'Anna, the final number three copy, remains behind on the wasteland of the original Earth. == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [[BattlestarWiki:Number Three|Number Three]] at [[Battlestar Wiki]] {{GalacticaCharacters}} [[Category:Cylons|#3]] [[Category:Fictional reporters|#3]] [[Category:Fictional cyborgs|#3]] [[Category:Fictional robots|#3]] [[Category:Fictional gynoids|#3]] [[Category:Fictional clones|#3]] [[es:Número Tres]] [[fr:Numéro Trois]] [[pl:D'Anna Biers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26796</id> <title>Number line</title> <text>{{Other uses}} {{Mergeto|Real line|date=January 2010}} In basic mathematics, a '''number line''' is a picture of a straight line on which every point is assumed to correspond to a [[real number]] and every real number to a point.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James B. | last2 = Redlin | first2 = Lothar | last3=Watson | first3=Saleem | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=College Algebra | publisher=[[Brooks Cole]] | year=2008 | edition = 5th | pages=13&ndash;19 | isbn=0-495-56521-0}}</ref> Often the [[integer]]s are shown as specially-marked points evenly spaced on the line. Although this image only shows the integers from &minus;9 to 9, the line includes all [[real number]]s, continuing "forever" in each direction, and also numbers not marked that are between the integers. It is often used as an aid in teaching simple [[addition]] and [[subtraction]], especially involving [[negative number]]s. [[File:Number-line.gif|center|The number line]] It is divided into two symmetric halves by the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], i.e. the number [[0 (number)|zero]]. In advanced mathematics, the expressions '''real number line''', or '''[[real line]]''' are typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a straight line corresponds to a single real number, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]]. ==Drawing the number line== The number line is usually represented as being [[horizontal plane|horizontal]]. Customarily, [[positive number]]s lie on the right side of zero, and [[negative number]]s lie on the left side of zero. An arrowhead on either end of the drawing is meant to suggest that the line continues indefinitely in the positive and negative [[real number]]s, denoted by <math>\mathbb{R}</math>. The real numbers consist of [[irrational number]]s and [[rational numbers]], as well as the [[integer]]s, [[whole number]]s, and the [[natural number]]s (the counting numbers). A line drawn through the origin at right angles to the real number line can be used to represent the [[imaginary number]]s. This line, called [[imaginary line (mathematics)|imaginary line]], extends the number line to a [[complex plane|complex number plane]], with points representing [[complex number]]s. ==See also== *[[Complex plane]] *[[Extended real number line]] *[[Number form]] (neurological phenomenon) *[[Line (geometry)]] *[[Real line]] *[[Real number]] *[[Chronology|Timeline]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Number Line}} [[Category:Elementary mathematics]] {{math-stub}} [[ar:مستقيم الأعداد]] [[bn:সংখ্যারেখা]] [[bg:Числова ос]] [[de:Zahlengerade]] [[et:Arvtelg]] [[es:Recta numérica]] [[eu:Zuzen erreal]] [[ko:수직선 (수학)]] [[it:Retta dei numeri reali]] [[he:ציר המספרים]] [[ht:Liy Nimewo]] [[ku:Jimarxêz]] [[hu:Számegyenes]] [[mk:Бројна оска]] [[nl:Getallenlijn]] [[ja:直線#座標]] [[uz:Sonlar o'qi]] [[pl:Oś liczbowa]] [[pt:Reta numérica]] [[ru:Числовая ось]] [[simple:Number line]] [[sl:Številska premica]] [[ckb:ھێڵی ژمارە ڕاستەقینەکان]] [[fi:Lukusuora]] [[sv:Tallinjen]] [[th:เส้นจำนวน]] [[uk:Числова вісь]] [[zh:数轴]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26824</id> <title>Numerical taxonomy</title> <text>'''Numerical taxonomy''' is a [[Biological classification|classification system]] in biological [[systematics]] which deals with the grouping by [[numerical method]]s of [[taxon|taxonomic units]] based on their character states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=461900&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d461900 |title="Numerical Taxonomy" |author= |date= |work=www.accessscience.com |publisher=McGraw Hill Ltd. |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>. It aims to create a [[taxonomy]] using numeric algorithms like [[cluster analysis]] rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by [[Robert R. Sokal]] & Peter H.A. Sneath in 1963<ref>Sokal & Sneath: ''Principles of Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1963</ref> and later elaborated by the same authors<ref>Sneath and Sokal: ''Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1973</ref>. They divided the field into [[phenetics]] in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and [[cladistics]] in which classifications based on the branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa. Note: in recent years many authors treat numerical taxonomy and phenetics as synonyms despite the distinctions made by those authors. Although intended as an objective classification method, in practice the choice and implicit weighing of characteristics is, of course, influenced by available data and research interests of the investigator. What was made objective was the introduction of explicit steps to be used to create phenograms and cladograms using numerical methods rather than subjective synthesis of data. == References == <references/> [[Category:Classification systems]] [[Category:Taxonomy]] [[de:Numerische Taxonomie]] [[es:Taxonomía numérica]] [[ko:수리분류학]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26841</id> <title>Nvidia Tegra</title> <text>[[File:Nvidia-Tegra-T2-embedded-Colibri-computer-module-by-Toradex.jpg|thumb|Colibri Tegra T2 computer module by Toradex, Switzerland]] '''Nvidia Tegra''' is a [[system-on-a-chip]] series developed by [[Nvidia]] for mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and [[mobile internet device]]s.
