conference'', March 2000.</ref> ==Ontology languages== {{Main|Ontology language}} An [[ontology language]] is a [[formal language]] used to encode the ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based: * [[Common Algebraic Specification Language]] is a general logic-based specification language developed within the IFIP working group 1.3 "Foundations of System Specifications" and functions as a de facto standard in the area of software specifications. It is now being applied to ontology specifications in order to provide modularity and structuring mechanisms. * [[Common logic]] is ISO standard 24707, a specification for a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other. * The [[Cyc]] project has its own ontology language called [[CycL]], based on [[first-order predicate calculus]] with some higher-order extensions. * [[DOGMA]] (Developing Ontology-Grounded Methods and Applications) adopts the fact-oriented modeling approach to provide a higher level of semantic stability. * The [[Gellish]] language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language. * [[IDEF5]] is a [[software engineering]] method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain ontologies. * [[KIF]] is a syntax for [[first-order logic]] that is based on [[S-expression]]s. * [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF) and [[F-Logic]] combine ontologies and rules. * [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] is a language for making ontological statements, developed as a follow-on from [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[RDFS]], as well as earlier ontology language projects including [[Ontology Inference Layer|OIL]], [[DARPA Agent Markup Language|DAML]] and [[DAMLplusOIL|DAML+OIL]]. OWL is intended to be used over the [[World Wide Web]], and all its elements (classes, properties and individuals) are defined as RDF [[resource (Web)|resources]], and identified by [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]s. * [http://sadl.sourceforge.net/sadl.html SADL] captures a subset of the expressiveness of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], using an English-like language entered via an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Plug-in. * [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|OBO]], a language used for biological and biomedical ontologies. ==Examples of published ontologies== * Basic Formal Ontology,<ref>[http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/ Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)]</ref> a formal upper ontology designed to support scientific research * BioPAX,<ref>[http://biopax.org BioPAX http://biopax.org]</ref> an ontology for the exchange and interoperability of biological pathway (cellular processes) data * BMO,<ref>A. Osterwalder (2002).[http://129.3.20.41/eps/io/papers/0202/0202004.pdf "An e-Business Model Ontology for Modeling e-Business"] at Bled, Slovenia, June 17â€“19, 2002.</ref> an e-Business Model Ontology based on a review of enterprise ontologies and business model literature * CCO (Cell-Cycle Ontology),<ref>[http://www.cellcycleontology.org/ CCO]</ref> an application ontology that represents the cell cycle * CContology,<ref>[http://www.jarrar.info/CContology/ CContology]</ref> an e-business ontology to support online customer complaint management * CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, an ontology for [[cultural heritage]]<ref>[http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/ CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]</ref> * COSMO,<ref>[http://micra.com/COSMO/ COSMO]</ref> a Foundation Ontology (current version in OWL) that is designed to contain representations of all of the primitive concepts needed to logically specify the meanings of any domain entity. It is intended to serve as a basic ontology that can be used to translate among the representations in other ontologies or databases. It started as a merger of the basic elements of the OpenCyc and SUMO ontologies, and has been supplemented with other ontology elements (types, relations) so as to include representations of all of the words in the Longman dictionary defining vocabulary. * [[Cyc]], a large Foundation Ontology for formal representation of the universe of discourse. * [[Disease Ontology]],<ref>[http://diseaseontology.sourceforge.net Disease Ontology]</ref> designed to facilitate the mapping of diseases and associated conditions to particular medical codes * [[DOLCE]], a Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering<ref>[http://www.loa-cnr.it/DOLCE.html DOLCE]</ref> * [[Dublin Core]], a simple ontology for documents and publishing * Foundational, Core and Linguistic Ontologies<ref>[http://www.loa-cnr.it/Ontologies.html Foundational, Core and Linguistic Ontologies]</ref> * [[Foundational Model of Anatomy]],<ref>[http://sig.biostr.washington.edu/projects/fm/AboutFM.html Foundational Model of Anatomy]</ref> an ontology for human anatomy * [[FOAF (software)|Friend of a Friend]], an ontology for describing persons, their activities and their relations to other people and objects * [[Gene Ontology]] for [[genomics]] * [[Gellish English dictionary]], an ontology that includes a dictionary and taxonomy that includes an upper ontology and a lower ontology that focusses on industrial and business applications in engineering, technology and procurement. See also [http://gellish.wiki.sourceforge.net/ Gellish] as [[Open Source]] project on SourceForge. * [[Geopolitical ontology]], an ontology describing geopolitical information created by [[Food and Agriculture Organization]](FAO). The geopolitical ontology includes names in multiple languages (English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Italian); maps standard coding systems (UN, ISO, FAOSTAT, AGROVOC, etc); provides relations among territories (land borders, group membership, etc); and tracks historical changes. In addition, FAO provides web services (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/webservices.asp?lang=en) of geopolitical ontology and a module maker (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/modulemaker/index.html) to download modules of the geopolitical ontology into different formats (RDF, XML, and EXCEL).
