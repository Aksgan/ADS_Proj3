[[OHRI|Ottawa Health Research Institute]] led by Dr. Dennis Bulman was added. Subsequently, operational funding from the [[CIHR]] Genomics Special Projects panel provided for additional staff. In 2001, a proposal entitled "Genome Resource Core Platform" was submitted to the then newly formed [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada]. This provided operational support, enhancing existing facilities and adding a mouse [[genotyping]] core at the [[University Of Toronto|University of Toronto]] led by Dr. Lucy Osborne. In 2002, [[Sickkids|SickKids]] built a new [[Affymetrix]] [[microarray]] facility. This core has quickly grown to become the largest such service centre in Canada and is in the top ten in North America<ref>Data provided by Affymetrix, Inc.</ref>. In 2004, TCAG entered a second phase of development driven by a $12 million [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] funded project entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research"<ref>Integrative Genomics for Health Research news item (Ontario Innovation Trust website) [http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/SStories21-40/StorySickKidsScherer.html]</ref>, allowing for consolidation of the mouse [[genotyping]] core with the [[Sickkids|SickKids]] facilities. This award also supported the establishment of an "Ontario Population Genomics Repository" (OPGP) to be used as controls in studies of common diseases. To efficiently complete this project, TCAG partnered with Dr. John McLaughlin's group at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)]]. In May, 2004, an application to the newly announced [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]] Research Hospital Fund resulted in a $10.9 million dollar award to build out lab space and consolidate all operations on the 14th and 15th floors of the Toronto Medical Discovery Tower (TMDT) in the [[MaRS Discovery District]]. TCAG was the first occupant of TMDT (in August, 2005), quickly followed by other [[Sickkids|SickKids]] scientists. Most recently, investments in computer infrastructure from the 2003 [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] competition have resulted in the establishment of new phases of the [http://ccb.sickkids.ca/hpf_index.html high-performance computing cluster] (HPF) that is currently used by TCAG and many other users, to allow analysis of large [[genomic]] datasets arising from new [[Dna microarray|microarray]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies. Further enhancements to the TCAG infrastructure will be supported by a $10.7 million renewal grant from CFI's Leading Edge Fund competition, entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research - Phase II", awarded in June of 2009<ref>SickKids press release, June 18, 2009 [http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/News-Room/Past-News/2009/cfi-funding.html]</ref>. From January, 2006, through March, 2011, TCAG is operating in large part on renewal funds from [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada], administered by the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute]. ==Research== Current research at TCAG centres around large-scale projects performed by facility personnel, including support of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] projects, and a significant focus on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. Service work is also performed for over 600 other academic, private sector and government labs each year, drawn from 30 different countries and spanning a wide variety of research disciplines.<ref>Data from progress reports submitted to the Ontario Genomics Institute</ref> Past research at TCAG is reflected by numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications. In 2008, TCAG Scientific Directors, Associate Scientists and staff co-authored 58 peer-reviewed manuscripts dependent in some way (either entirely, or in part) on the platform infrastructure, as documented in [[Pubmed|PubMed]].<ref>PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals during calendar year 2008, excluding Dr. Brudno who was added in 2009 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}</ref> Since 2002, over 270 such papers have been published.<ref>PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals, 2002 through present, excluding Drs.
