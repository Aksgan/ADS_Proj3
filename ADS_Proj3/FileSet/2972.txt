is able to 'run' many different types of software. But soft modding is even more popular because of its ease of installation and its relatively low price (it can even be done for free with the right tools). Another type of console modding is about appearances, much like computer case modification, which includes adding lights, cutting the game system case, or adding devices such as whisper quiet fans. === Game software === {{main|Mod (computer gaming)}} <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:XJ8 and XJ6.JPG|thumb|250px|Two examples of game modifications in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'': 2004 Jaguar XJ8 and 1994 Jaguar XJ6. Real-life makes and models are not included in the game but can be created and added by modders.]] --> On the other side, some companies actively encourage modding of their products. In cases such as [[TiVo]] and [[Google]], there has been an informal agreement between the modders and the company in which the modders agree not to do anything that destroys the company's business model and the company agrees to support the modding community by providing technical specifications and information. Some commercial [[video game]]s thrive through a [[mod (computer gaming)|modding]] community. In the case of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', a mod called ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' drove sales of the original software for years. Many games, such as ''[[The Elder Scrolls|The Elder Scrolls series]]'', come with a mod editing tool that allows users to create original content for themselves and others. Other games provide the [[source code]] for users to use in experimenting and creating. Still others, like ''[[18 Wheels of Steel]]'', will provide the non-programmed data (images, small codepieces and the like) in a simple archive, which can often be opened by renaming it to a .zip file. Often modders will take the game in directions that the developers never anticipated or didn't have time/funding to include. Generally, a small percent of game players will spend much time mod making, but those who do usually develop communities around modding a particular game. Communities are generally connected via a web forum where new modders can ask questions of more experienced ones, and everyone can find inspiration in the work of others. Some games, like ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'', could never have been as successful as they are without a thriving user community. And as more people have been more connected via the web, this has become a vital and dynamic creative phenomena where users become content creators not just content consumers. Skilled computer users who are able to crack data formats and reverse engineer a game can modify them to their heart's content, because the creator of the [[software]] has [[copyright]] authority over who may use it, or change it. Software is sold with a license that spells out what guarantees, if any, come with the software, and what rights the purchaser has to change the software. Many people do not read these contracts, or store them in such a way to be able to prove what contract came with what purchase, so some computer users are ignorant to what their rights are with respect to backing up software, modifying software, and sharing it with other potential users. On August 5, 2009 Matthew Crippen, a student at California State University, was arrested for modifying game consoles such as Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo Wii for profit.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=8244137 ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> According to him it was so that the owners could play their backup discs of games they legally own. However, according to the DMCA, it is illegal to circumvent copyright protection software, even for non-pirating uses such as backing up legally owned games. === Device drivers === Modded [[device driver|drivers]] are made for improved performance which official versions of drivers do not offer or in cases where there are no official versions of drivers for new [[hardware]] designed for older [[operating system]]s such as [[Windows 98]]. === Computer hardware === {{See also|Case modding}} Case modding is the first thing that comes in to mind when the term modding is applied to computer hardware. This may include from simple case painting to full blown case mod with cooling mods and fabricated pieces. [[Overclocking]] may also be termed as 'modding', and the overclocking of a graphics card using driver software to gain the performance of a more expensive model is known as 'soft-modding'. Volt modding is a term in which jumpers and rheostats are used to mod a hardware's voltages to yield better overclocks. == Cars and vehicles == {{Main|Car tuning}} === Orthopedic === Ortho-modding is the car adaptation (seats, [[pedal]]s, etc.) to help drivers to prevent, correct and diminish light [[orthopedic]] and [[backbone]]/[[vertebral column|spine]] problems. === Eco-modding === Eco-modding is the reduction of drag (see [[Low-energy vehicle]]), petroleum car adaptation to use renewable energy (generally, changing or adding a new [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] or [[electric motor|motor]]), generally [[hydrogen]] or [[electricity]]. See [[hybrid car]]. Occasionally, it has been known to run a [[Diesel engine]] on plant and animal oils. See [[Biodiesel]]. === Performance tuning === [[Car tuning|Car]] and [[engine tuning]] are modification of a car for enhanced performance, in engine power output, handling, aerodynamics, or cosmetic purposes. See also [[:Category:Vehicle modification]]. == Industrial machines == Factories get rather expensive machines that are used to mass produce specialized parts. These machines can be altered to make parts other than how the manufacturers of the machines designed or intended them. The legality of doing this depends on who owns the machines, and whether the agreement, that supplied the machines to the factories, said anything about this, and what the laws are in the nation where this is being done. For example, the machines might be leased from the manufacturer of the machines. If they are ever to be returned, they need to go back in the same kind of condition and engineering shape as when they were first delivered. There is an annual physical inventory to make sure the factory has everything that they are leasing. This audit might be done by representatives of the leasing company, who are looking to see recognizable
