The consoles came complete with a 20 GB HDD also in green to match the top and bottom sections that are typically grey in color. The HDD plate was also personalized and engraved with the team member's [[gamertag]]. Few examples have been seen with simply the console release date November 22, 2005 engraved on the HDD plate. The consoles came with a limited issue controller to accompany the console. The difference with the controller again is the grey part on the controller is replaced with a green molded plastic, not painted contrary to popular belief, to match the console. Each console came with a plain white faceplate. However as an additional gift, each team member was given an additional packaged faceplate with one of a kind art with the caption "I Made This" on the USB door of the faceplate. Very few examples have been sold off from original team member's collection. [[Larry Hyrb]], better known as "Major Nelson", is known to own one which he displays pictures of on his website having been a member of the Launch Team. The special edition Launch Team console, hard drive, controller and the special faceplate were never sold in stores or meant for the general public. It is unknown as of now how many of these very rare consoles exist today. ===Holiday bundles=== As with the original Xbox, Microsoft has continued bundling two video game titles in console retail packaging during the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]].
