If a third party (usually referred to as Eve, for 'eavesdropper') has gained any information about the photons' polarization, this introduces errors in Bobs' measurements. If more than <math>p</math> bits differ they abort the key and try again, possibly with a different quantum channel, as the security of the key cannot be guaranteed. <math>p</math> is chosen so that if the number of bits known to Eve is less than this, privacy amplification can be used to reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrarily small amount, by reducing the length of the key. === E91 protocol: Artur Ekert (1991) === The Ekert scheme uses entangled pairs of photons. These can be created by Alice, by Bob, or by some source separate from both of them, including eavesdropper Eve. The photons are distributed so that Alice and Bob each end up with one photon from each pair. The scheme relies on two properties of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated in the sense that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect. The original Ekert protocol consist of using three possible states and testing [[Bell inequality]] violation for detecting eavesdropping. === S09 protocol: Eduin H. SERNA (2009) === Unlike the BB84 protocol and its many variants, this protocol (Eduin H. Serna, 2009)<ref>[Eduin H SERNA http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0908/0908.2146v3.pdf Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with Private-Public Key] </ref> uses two quantum channels. It is also described with public key cryptography combinations and private key cryptography. Its description does not make reconciliation mechanisms of information to derive the key. The quantum protocol presented provides a safe sending of information of direct communication between two or more parties. This protocol is suitable for the generalizations of n parties and can allow a network of massive sending information for n -1 parties being one of them the keymessage distribution center. Because the proposed protocol does not use classical communication, it is immune to the man-in-the-middle attack on the classical communication channel which several cryptography protocols suffer from. But on the other hand, implementation of this protocol may be harder because the qubits get exchanged multiple times. == Privacy amplification and information reconciliation == The quantum key distribution protocols described above provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, and also with an estimate of the discrepancy between the keys. These differences can be caused by eavesdropping, but also by imperfections in the transmission line and detectors. As it is impossible to distinguish between these two types of errors, guaranteed security requires the assumption that all errors are due to eavesdropping. Provided the error rate between the keys is lower than a certain threshold (20% as of April 2007<ref>H. Chau, Physical Review A 66, 60302 (2002) ([http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/123456789/43370/1/75688.pdf])</ref>), two steps can be performed to first remove the erroneous bits and then reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrary small value. These two steps are known as '''information reconciliation''' and '''privacy amplification''' respectively, and were first described in 1992.<ref>C. H. Bennett, F. Bessette, G. Brassard, L. Salvail and J. Smolin "[http://cs.uccs.edu/~cs691/crypto/BBBSS92.pdf Experimental Quantum Cryptography]" Journal of Cryptology vol.5, no.1, 1992, pp. 3-28.</ref> '''Information reconciliation''' is a form of error correction carried out between Alice and Bob's keys, in order to ensure both keys are identical. It is conducted over the public channel and as such it is vital to minimise the information sent about each key, as this can be read by Eve. A common protocol used for information reconciliation is the '''cascade protocol''', proposed in 1994.<ref>G. Brassard and L. Salvail "Secret key reconciliation by public discussion" Advances in Cryptology: Eurocrypt 93 Proc. pp 410-23 (1993) ([http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/96923.html])</ref> This operates in several rounds, with both keys divided into blocks in each round and the [[parity (telecommunication)|parity]] of those blocks compared. If a difference in parity is found then a [[binary search]] is performed to find and correct the error. If an error is found in a block from a previous round that had correct parity then another error must be contained in that block; this error is found and corrected as before. This process is repeated recursively, which is the source of the cascade name. After all blocks have been compared, Alice and Bob both reorder their keys in the same random way, and a new round begins. At the end of multiple rounds Alice and Bob have identical keys with high probability, however Eve has additional information about the key from the parity information exchanged. '''Privacy Amplification''' is a method for reducing (and effectively eliminating) Eve's partial information about Alice and Bob's key. This partial information could have been gained both by eavesdropping on the quantum channel during key transmission (thus introducing detectable errors), and on the public channel during information reconciliation (where it is assumed Eve gains all possible parity information). Privacy amplification uses Alice and Bob's key to produce a new, shorter key, in such a way
