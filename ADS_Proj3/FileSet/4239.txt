Stencils are the basis for many algorithms to numerically solve [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE). Two examples of stencils are the [[five-point stencil]] and the [[Crank–Nicolson method]] stencil. Stencils are classified into two categories: [[Compact stencil|compact]] and [[Non-compact stencil|non-compact]], the difference being the layers from the point of interest that are also used for calculation. ==See also== *[[Compact stencil]] *[[Non-compact stencil]] *[[Five-point stencil]] == References == <references/> * W.
