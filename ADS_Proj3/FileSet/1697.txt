From 2005 to 2009, she led a [[grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] supported by her own parliamentary group (consisting of [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (SPD)]]. Following general elections on 27 September 2009, Merkel built the current coalition government replacing the Social Democratic Party with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party (FDP)]]. ==Geography== {{Main|Geography of Germany}} [[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Topographic map]] Germany is located in the Central Europe, the territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the 63rd largest in the world. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]] (the tip of [[Sylt]] is just north of 55°), and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[16th meridian east|16° E]]. Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=s}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=s}} below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major [[river]]s such as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].<ref name="CIA">{{cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html| title = CIA Factbook | accessdate = 2010-10-23| author = CIA | authorlink = Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> Germany shares borders with more European countries than any other country on the continent. Its neighbours are Denmark in the north, Poland and the Czech Republic in the east, Austria and Switzerland in the south, France and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west and Belgium and the Netherlands in the north-west.

The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], which is the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea including the area along the Rhine, which flows into the North Sea. Consequently in the north-west and the north, the climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs year round with a maximum during summer. Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}} for prolonged periods. In the east, the climate is more [[continental climate|continental]]; winters can be very cold, summers can be very warm, and long dry periods are often recorded. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a so-called mountain climate. This climate is characterized by lower temperatures because of higher altitudes and greater precipitation caused by air becoming moisture-laden as it lifts over higher terrain.<ref>[http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm Climate In Germany] GermanCulture.

The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine.<ref>[http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/ecoregion_list/ List of Ecoregions: Terrestrial Ecoregions] WWF. Retrieved 21 November 2000.</ref> The majority of Germany is covered by either [[arable land]] (33%) or [[forestry]] and [[woodland]] (31%). Only 15% is covered by permanent pastures. Plants and animals are those generally common to middle Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Fish abound in the rivers and the North Sea. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare,
