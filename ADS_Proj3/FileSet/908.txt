during the selection and implementation of a [[software application]] in an organisation or [[company]]. The purpose of the Conference Room Pilot is to validate a software application against the business processes of [[end-user]]s of the software, by allowing end-users to use the software to carry out typical or key business processes using the new software. A commercial advantage of a Conference Room Pilot is that it may allow the [[customer]] to prove that the new software will do the job (meets business requirements and expectations) before committing to buying the software, thus avoiding buying an inappropriate application. The term is most commonly used in the context of '[[out of the box]]' (OOTB) or '[[commercial off-the-shelf]]' software (COTS). ==Compared to User Acceptance Testing== Although a Conference Room Pilot shares some features of [[User Acceptance Testing]] (UAT), it should not be considered a testing process - it validates Design or Solution fit for purpose at a higher level than functional testing. Shared features of CRP and UAT include: *End-to-end business processes are used as a "business input" for both *Functionality demonstrations *Non-functional validation(e.g. performance testing) Differences between a Conference Room Pilot and a formal UAT: *It is attempting to identify how well the application meets business needs, and identify gaps, whilst still in the design phase of the project *There is an expectation that changes will be required before acceptance of the solution *The software is ‘on trial’ and may be rejected completely in favour of another solution. == References == *http://www.ensync-corp.com/consulting/conference_room_pilot.cfm?section=consulting *http://www-archive.ui-integrate.uillinois.edu/news_art_crp.asp *http://www.bourkeconsulting.com/documents/POCCRPBCAWebsite020903.pdf *http://www.smthacker.co.uk/conference_room_pilot.htm {{Compu-prog-stub}} [[Category:Software testing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7712</id> <title>Conference on Automated Deduction</title> <text>The '''Conference on Automated Deduction''' ('''CADE''') is the premier [[academic conference]] on [[Automated theorem proving|automated deduction]] and related fields. The first CADE was organized in 1974 at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] near [[Chicago]]. Most CADE meetings have been held in [[Europe]] and the [[USA]]. However, conferences have been held all over the world. Since 1996, CADE has been held yearly, and since 2001 it has occasionally merged with other conferences to form the [[International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning]] (IJCAR). In 1996, CADE Inc. was formed as a non-profit sub-corporation of the [[Association for Automated Reasoning]] to organize the previously individually organized conferences. ==External links== * [http://www.cadeconference.org CADE web page] * [http://www.aarinc.org AAR web page] {{Comp-sci-stub}} {{compu-conference-stub}} [[Category:Theoretical computer science conferences]] [[Category:Logic conferences]] [[pl:CADE]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7715</id> <title>Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems</title> <text>'''SenSys''', the '''ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems''', is an annual [[academic conference]] in the area of [[embedded networked sensors]]. ==About SenSys== {{Advert|section|date=February 2009}} '''[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] SenSys''' is a highly selective, single-track forum for the presentation of research results on [[Computer Systems|systems]] issues in the area of [[embedded networked sensors]]. This [[:wikt:conference|conference]] provides an ideal venue to address the [[research]] challenges facing the [[design]], [[System deployment|deployment]], use, and fundamental limits of these systems. [[Sensor networks]] require contributions from many fields, from [[wireless communication]] and [[Computer networking|networking]], [[embedded systems]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[distributed systems]], [[data management]], and [[Application software|applications]], so SenSys welcomes cross-disciplinary work. ==Ranking== Although there is no official ranking of [[academic conference]]s on [[wireless sensor networks]], SenSys is widely regarded by researchers as one of the two (along with [[IPSN]]) most [[prestigious]] conferences focusing on [[sensor network]] research. SenSys focuses more on system issues while [[IPSN]] on algorithmic and theoretical considerations. The [[acceptance rate]] for 2006 was 19.7% (24 out of 122 papers accepted for publication). ==SenSys Events== SenSys started in year 2003 and following is a list of SenSys events from 2003 to 2010: * [http://sensys.acm.org/2010/ SenSys 2010], Zurich, Switzerland, November 3-5, 2010 * [http://sensys.acm.org/2009/ SenSys 2009], Berkeley, California, USA, November 4-6, 2009 * [http://sensys.acm.org/2008/ SenSys 2008], Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, November 5-7, 2008 * [http://sensys.acm.org/2007/ SenSys 2007], Sydney, Australia, November 6-9, 2007 * [http://sensys.acm.org/2006/ SenSys 2006], Boulder, Colorado, USA, November 1-3, 2006 * [http://sensys.acm.org/2005/ SenSys 2005], San Diego, CA, USA, November 2-4, 2005 * [http://sensys.acm.org/2004/ SenSys 2004], Baltimore, MD, USA, November 3-5, 2004 * [http://sensys.acm.org/2003/ SenSys 2003], Los Angeles, California, USA, November 5-7, 2003 ==Sponsors== SenSys is sponsored by the following [[Association for Computing Machinery#Special Interest Groups|ACM Special Interest Groups]]: *[[SIGCOMM]] *[[SIGMOBILE]] *[[SIGARCH]] *[[SIGOPS]] *[[SIGMETRICS]] *[[SIGBED]] ==See also== * [[Wireless sensor network]] ==External links== * [http://sensys.acm.org/ SenSys] * [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/sensys/index.html SenSys Bibliography] (from DBLP) * [http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=SERIES11170&idx=SERIES11170&type=series&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&part=series&WantType=Proceedings&title=&CFID=609084&CFTOKEN=22369192 SenSys Proceedings] (from ACM website) [[Category:Wireless sensor network]] [[Category:Computer networking conferences]] {{Wireless Sensor Network}} {{Comp-sci-stub}} {{compu-conference-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>7716</id> <title>Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</title> <text>{{Infobox Academic Conference | logo = [[Image:Chi2011 logo.svg|225px]]<br /><br />''Logo of the 2011 conference'' | history = 1982- | discipline = [[Human-computer interaction]] | abbreviation = CHI | publisher = [[Association of Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGCHI]] | country = International | frequency = annual }} The '''ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems''' ('''CHI''') series of [[academic conference]]s is generally considered the most prestigious in the field of [[human-computer interaction]]. It is hosted by [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGCHI]], the [[Special Interest Group]] on Computer-Human Interaction. CHI has been held annually since 1982 and attracts thousands of international attendees. CHI 2011 will be held in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. ==History== The CHI conference series started with the Human Factors in Computer Systems conference in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]], [[Maryland]], USA in 1982. During this meeting the formation of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) was first publicly announced. ACM SIGCHI became the sponsor of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The first CHI conference was held in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, in 1983. The second conference took place in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], USA, in 1985. <ref>{{ cite web | url=http://old.sigchi.org/bulletin/1996.1/conf-chairs.html | title=The CHI Conference: Interviews with Conference Chairs | first=Steven | last=Pemberton | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] year=1996 accessdate=2008-09-29 }}</ref> Since then, CHI conferences have been held annually in spring each year. Till 1992 the conference was held in [[Canada]] or the USA. In 1993 CHI moved to [[Europe]] for the first time and was held in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{ cite web | title=Past CHI Conferences | url=http://www.chi2007.org/welcome/pastchi.php | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2008-09-29 | work=CHI 2007
