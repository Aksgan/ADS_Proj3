[[Information Technology|IT]] overview [[education]] and as a brainstorming, preliminary investigation tool in [[systems development process]]es such as the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]. It consists of at least three, and sometimes four, distinct components. In contemporary [[Information Technology]], it is almost always discussed as a four component model in which the fourth is a named optional. The components of the IPO model are defined as: * I: [[Input/output|Input]] - The information, ideas, and resources used * P: [[Processing]] - Actions taken upon/using input or stored material * O: [[Output]] - Results of the processing that then exit the system * S: [[Computer storage|Storage]] - Location(s) where material inside the system is/are placed for possible use at a later time == Sub-components == Sub-components of a system can also have their own set of inputs and outputs that may differ from those of the larger system. Typically, outputs of a subcomponent are either input for another sub-component or become part of the ultimate output of the larger system. Whether or not a system is being considered at the [[macroscopic|macro]] or [[micro]] level determines what a specific item in a system is considered, and this variable level of detail is referred to as [[Scope (programming)|scope]]. [[Explicit]] discussions on scope are more common in a technological discussion as sub-units are considered more discretely in the [[natural sciences]]. In [[ecosystems]], for example, sub-units are impacts as opposed to [[Object (computer science)|object]]s, [[Namespace (computer science)|namespaces]], [[Method (computer science)|method]]s, and [[Scale (computing)|scale]]. Exceptions to this convention are when [[Nominal data|nominal]] [[data point]]s must be encoded for a [[scientific model]] simulation. == See also == * [[Conceptual model]]s * [[Data model]] * [[HIPO]] * [[SIPOC]] == External links == * [http://www.teach-ict.com/as_a2/topics/input%20processing%20output/input_process_output/index.htm Teach-ICT.com Primer] on the IPO Model * [http://www.incits.org/tc_home/k5htm/andfig34.gif Input-Process-Output] example chart by the [[InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards]] (INCITS) [[Category:Information systems]] {{soft-eng-stub}} [[de:EVA-Prinzip]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17623</id> <title>IP Justice</title> <text>'''IP Justice''' is an international civil liberties organization that promotes balanced [[intellectual property]] laws and freedom of expression in a digital world. IP Justice was founded in 2002 by cyber-rights attorney [[Robin Gross]]. IP Justice has an international board of directors, is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit charity and is based in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood. IP Justice has launched campaigns at the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], on the proposed Free Trade Area of the America's Treaty, the European Union [[directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights]] and has been active in [[Internet governance]] discussions, including at the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) and the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF). IP Justice is a founding member of several IGF Dynamic Coalitions, including coalitions on Free Expression, Access to Knowledge, an Internet Bill of Rights, Open Standards, and Privacy. ==See also== *[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] *[[Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization|Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO]] * [[Info wars]] (2004 Documentary Film) == External links == * [http://www.ipjustice.org IP Justice official website] * [http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2003/02/20/robin.html Oreillynet.com article] * [http://www.news.com/2008-1082-981663.html news.com interview] with [[Robin Gross]] * [http://www.theinquirer.net/articles/printView/gb/inquirer/news/2003/10/20/international-treaty-will-force-34-democracies-to-change-copyright-ip-laws International treaty will force 34 democracies to change copyright, IP laws] {{poli-org-stub}} [[Category:Politics and technology]] [[Category:Internet privacy]] [[Category:2002 establishments]] [[Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States]] [[Category:Intellectual property organizations]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17625</id> <title>IP Pascal</title> <text>'''IP Pascal''' is an implementation of the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal programming language]] using the IP portability platform, a multiple machine, operating system and language implementation system. == Overview == IP Pascal implements the language "Pascaline" (named after Blaise Pascal's calculator), which is a highly extended superset of ISO 7185 Pascal. It adds [[module (programming)|modularity]] with [[namespace]] control, including the [[parallel tasking]] [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitor]] concept, dynamic [[array data structure|arrays]], [[Polymorphism (computer science)|overloads]] and [[overrides]], [[object (computer science)|object]]s, and a host of other minor extensions to the language. IP implements a porting platform, including a [[widget toolkit]], [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] library, [[MIDI]] and sound library and other functions, that allows both programs written under IP Pascal, and IP Pascal itself, to move to multiple operating systems and machines. IP Pascal is one of the only Pascal implementations that still exist that has passed the Pascal Validation Suite, a large suite of tests created to verify compliance with ISO 7185 Pascal. Although Pascaline extends ISO 7185 Pascal, it does not reduce the type safety of Pascal (as many other dialects of Pascal have by including so called "type escapes"). The functionality of the language is similar to that of [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (which implements a C++ like language but with the type insecurities removed), and Pascaline can be used anywhere managed programs can be used (even though it is based on a language 30 years older than C#). == Open/Closed status == The author of Pascaline the language has stated that the there is no wish to have it remain as a proprietary language. IP Pascal is sold as implementation of Pascaline, but the language itself can and should be open, and have quality implementations. To that end, the full specification for Pascaline will be published online, and the long term intention is to create a version of the open source P5 compiler/interpreter (an ISO 7185 version of Wirth's P4 compiler/interpreter) which implements Pascaline compliance. This will be known as the P6 compiler, and it will also be openly published and distributed. The value of IP Pascal as a commercial product will be based on the IDE and compiler/encoder resources of that system. == Language == IP Pascal starts with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 7185 [[pascal programming language|Pascal]] (which standardized [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s original language), and adds: * modules, including parallel task constructs '''process''', '''monitor''' and '''share'''. '''module''' mymod(input, output);<br/> '''uses''' extlib; '''const''' one = 1;<br/> '''type''' string = '''packed''' '''array''' '''of''' char;<br/> '''procedure''' wrtstr('''view''' s: string);<br/> '''private'''<br/> '''var''' s: string;<br/> '''procedure''' wrtstr('''view''' s: string);<br/> '''var''' i: integer;<br/> '''begin'''<br/> '''for''' i := 1 '''to''' max(s) '''do''' write(s[i])<br/> '''end''';<br/> '''begin''' { initialize monitor }<br/> '''end''';<br/> '''begin''' { shutdown monitor }<br/> '''end'''. Modules have entry and exit sections. Declarations in modules form their own interface specifications, and it is
