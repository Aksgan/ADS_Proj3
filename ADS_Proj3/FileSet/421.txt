A biased graph is a generalization of the combinatorial essentials of a [[gain graph]] and in particular of a [[signed graph]]. Formally, a '''biased graph''' Ω is a pair (''G'', '''''B''''') where '''''B''''' is a '''linear class''' of circles; this by definition is a class of circles that satisfies the theta-graph property mentioned above. A [[subgraph]] or edge set whose circles are all in '''''B''''' (and which contains no [[Graph (mathematics)|half-edges]]) is called '''balanced'''. For instance, a circle belonging to '''''B''''' is ''balanced'' and one that does not belong to '''''B''''' is ''unbalanced''. Biased graphs are interesting mostly because of their [[matroid]]s, but also because of their connection with multiary [[quasigroups]]. See below. ==Technical notes== A biased graph may have [[Graph (mathematics)|half-edges]] (one endpoint) and [[Graph (mathematics)|loose edges]] (no endpoints). The edges with two endpoints are of two kinds: a link has two distinct endpoints, while a loop has two coinciding endpoints. Linear classes of circles are a special case of linear subclasses of circuits in a [[matroid]]. ==Examples== * If every circle belongs to '''''B''''', and there are no half-edges, Ω is balanced. A balanced biased graph is (for most purposes) essentially the same as an ordinary graph. * If '''''B''''' is empty, Ω is called '''contrabalanced'''. Contrabalanced biased graphs are related to [[bicircular matroid]]s. * If '''''B''''' consists of the circles of odd length, Ω is called '''antibalanced''' and is the biased graph obtained from an all-negative [[signed graph]]. * The linear class '''''B''''' is '''additive''', that is, closed under set sum (for sums that give a circle), [[if and only if]] '''''B''''' is the class of positive circles of a signed graph. * Ω may consist of a cycle of length ''n'' ≥ 3 with all edge doubled and such that no [[digon]] (circle of length 2) is balanced. Call this a '''biased 2''C<sub>n</sub>''''' . Such biased graphs lead to spikes and swirls (see Matroids, below). * Some kinds of biased graph are obtained from [[gain graph]]s or are generalizations of special kinds of gain graphs. The latter include '''biased expansion graphs''', which generalize [[gain graph|group expansion graph]]s. ==Minors== A [[Minor (graph theory)|minor]] of a biased graph Ω = (''G'', '''''B''''') is the result of any sequence of taking subgraphs and contracting edge sets. For biased graphs, as for graphs, it suffices to take a subgraph (which may be the whole graph) and then contract an edge set (which may be the empty set). A '''subgraph''' of Ω consists of a subgraph ''H'' of the underlying graph ''G'', with balanced circle class consisting of those balanced circles that are in ''H''. The '''deletion''' of an edge set ''S'', written Ω &minus; ''S'', is the subgraph with all vertices and all edges except those of ''S''. '''Contraction''' of Ω is relatively complicated. To contract one edge ''e'', the procedure depends on the kind of edge ''e'' is. If ''e'' is a link, contract it in ''G''. A circle ''C'' in the contraction ''G''/''e'' is balanced if either ''C'' or <math>C \cup e</math> is a balanced circle of ''G''. If ''e'' is a balanced loop or a loose edge, it is simply deleted. If it is an unbalanced loop or a half-edge, it and its vertex ''v'' are deleted; each other edge with ''v'' as an endpoint loses that endpoint, so a link with ''v'' as one endpoint becomes a half-edge at its other endpoint, while a loop or half-edge at ''v'' becomes a loose edge.
