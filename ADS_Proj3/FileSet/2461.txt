the attending physician. ===Order entry and check in=== An order is placed in the system usually by a physician or laboratory scientist. The order or lab request contains a list of tests to be performed on one or more patient specimens (e.g., blood or urine). In many cases, each order is tracked with a unique identifier. This identifier (which is usually a number) is often referred to as Lab ID. In this hypothetical case, a CBC is ordered which is a panel of sub-tests including white blood cell count, red cell blood count and other blood-related tests. A [[phlebotomist]] will be called on to collect the specimen(s) from the patient. Often, different specimens will be collected, so as to provide different tubes (each with a specific cap color) for each analyzer that will process the samples. In this case, the appropriate specimen (using a vacutainer tube with a lavender top) is taken from the patient and labeled with a bar code specimen label produced by the LIS. The LIS will print barcode labels (with the unique lab ID) for the draw tubes. In some cases, more advanced LIS products will also provide a unique identifier for each specimen. This provides the ability to track the specimen's chain of custody from the point it is taken from the patient to the point that it gets discarded. The specimen-accession-patient hierarchy is linked in a tree like numeric structure. In other cases,the patient is identified by a Lab ID linked to the patient's demographic record through the Hospital number. ===Specimen receiving=== After the specimen is collected, it is sent/brought to the lab for processing typically in a batch. This event should be recorded in the LIS. On reception of the specimen in the testing lab, either manual or automated lab work can begin. Many tests, such as CBCs or Chemistry profiles, are performed by automated analyzers. ===Send test orders to analyzers=== Most LIS systems can be configured to download the specimen data to an analyzer either after the order is placed or when a specimen is received in a testing lab. When the specimen's barcode is read by the instrument, the unique ID from the specimen label is matched with the order previously downloaded to the instrument. This system is often called "Batch Download". A more efficient system is called "Host Query", where the instrument reads the barcode on the specimen and "queries" the LIS for the test orders. The LIS will be listening on a communication port for queries and will download the requests only when required. In cases where the LIS transmits data such as test orders or control messages to analyzers the communication is set up to be bi-directional. ===Results entry=== When results of lab tests are available, they are entered into the system manually or automatically downloaded from an instrument. Once these results are double-checked by the Medical Laboratory Scientist or autoverified, they are released. Released results are often automatically printed or written on lab reports which are delivered to the attending physician or clinic. Results must be verified and released to attending physicians as soon as possible. ===Lab reporting=== Lab Reports are the final output of all LIS systems and, in many cases, the primary LIS interaction with healthcare professionals outside the lab. The reports can either be printed or faxed in paper-based labs; they can be delivered via email or file in paperless labs. The degree to which an LIS supports customizable lab reports and flexibility in modes of delivery of results is one major factor in determining its success in the marketplace. ==Basic features== Laboratory Information Systems commonly support the following features: *Patient Check In *Order Entry *Specimen Processing *Result(s) Entry *Reporting *Patient Demographics *Physician Demographics ==Additional features== In addition LISs commonly support the following: *Web-based order entry *Web-based results inquiry *Faxing and emailing of lab reports *Custom report creation *HL7 interfaces with reference labs and EMRs *Preliminary reporting *Final reporting *Med tech worksheets *Workload balancing *Medicare medical necessity checking *Billing *Public health reporting *Rule engines *report check by reputed pathologist and senior technologist ==Types== There are many laboratory disciplines requiring the support of computerized informatics.

Fisher]] and reported in his book ''[[Statistical methods for research workers]].'' The lady in question was [[Muriel Bristol]], and the test used was [[Fisher's exact test]]. In [[popular science]], [[David Salsburg]] published a book entitled ''[[The Lady Tasting Tea]]'',<ref name=S2002>Salsburg (2002)</ref> which describes Fisher's experiment and ideas on [[randomization]]. The lady in question claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. Salsburg<ref name=S2002/> reports that a colleague of Fisher, [[H. Fairfield Smith]] revealed that in the test, the woman got all eight cups correct. The chance of someone who just guesses getting all correct, assuming she guesses that four had the tea put in first and four the milk, would be only 1 in 70 (the [[combination]]s of 8 taken 4 at a time). [[Deb Basu]] wrote that "the famous case of the 'lady tasting tea'" was "one of the two supporting pillars . . . of the randomization analysis of experimental data".<ref>Basu (1980a, p. 575; 1980b)</ref> ==See also== * [[Permutation test]] * [[Random assignment]] * [[Randomization test]] ==Notes== <references/> ==References== * {{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2287648 |title=Randomization Analysis
