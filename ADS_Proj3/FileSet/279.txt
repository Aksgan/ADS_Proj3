of Architecture's Reason,"] Footprint (#1, Autumn 2007), pp. 31-46.</ref> ===Nineteenth century=== A vibrant strain of [[Neoclassicism]], inherited from [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]'s seminal Essai, provided the foundation for two generations of international activity around the core themes of classicism, [[primitivism]] and a "return to Nature." Reaction against the dominance of [[neo-classical architecture]] came to the fore in the 1820s with [[Augustus Pugin]] providing a moral and theoretical basis for [[Gothic Revival architecture]], and in the 1840s [[John Ruskin]] developed this ethos. The American sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] published the essay ''American Architecture'' in August 1843 in which he rejected the imitation of old styles of buildings and outlined the functional relationship between architecture and decoration. These theories anticipated the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] in [[modern architecture]]. Towards the end of the century, there occurred a blossoming of theoretical activity. In England, Ruskin's ideals underpinned the emergence of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] exemplified by the writings of [[William Morris]]. This in turn formed the basis for [[Art Nouveau]] in the [[UK]], exemplified by the work of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], and influenced the [[Vienna Secession]]. On the Continent, the theories of [[Viollet-le-Duc]] and [[Gottfried Semper]] provided the springboard for enormous vitality of thought dedicated to architectural innovation and the renovation of the notion of style. Semper in particular developed an international following, in [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]]. The generation born during the middle-third of the 19th century was largely enthralled with the opportunities presented by Semper's combination of a breathtaking historical scope and a methodological granularity. In contrast to more recent, and thus "modern", thematically self-organized theoretical activities, this generation did not coalesce into a "movement." They did, however, seem to converge on Semper's use of the concept of ''Realismus'', and they are thus labelled proponents of [[architectural realism]]. Among the most active Architectural Realists were: [[Georg Heuser]], [[Rudolf Redtenbacher]], [[Constantin Lipsius]], [[Hans Auer]], [[Paul Sédille]], [[Lawrence Harvey]], [[Otto Wagner]] and [[Richard Streiter]]. ===Twentieth century=== Around the turn of the 20th century [[Camillo Sitte]] published the ''City Planning According to Artistic Principles'' which was not exactly a criticism of architectural form, but more precisely an aesthetic criticism of the 19th century's urbanism. Mainly an [[urban planning]] theory book, it has a deep influence in architecture, as the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. It was also highly successful in its time. Between 1889 and 1922 it is edited five times, French translation came in 1902 and the English translation in 1945, in New York. For Sitte, the most important is not the architectural shape or form of each building, but the inherent creative quality of urban space, the whole as much more than the sum of its parts. Modernist movements rejected these thoughts and [[Le Corbusier]] energetically dismissed the work. Nevertheless, his work is often used and cited as a criticism to the [[Modernist]] movement, and reemerged its importance in the [[post-modernist]] movement, late in the sixties. Also on the topic of artistic notions with regard to urbanism was [[Louis Sullivan]]'s ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'' of 1896.<ref>Louis H. Sullivan. ''Kindergarten Chats and Other Writings.'' Courier Dover Publications, 1979. Page 202. ISBN 0486238121</ref> In this essay, Sullivan penned his famous adage "form forever follows function"; a phrase that was to be later adopted as a central tenet of Modernist architectural theory. While later architects adopted the abbreviated phrase "form follows function" as a polemic in service of functionalist doctrine, Sullivan wrote of function with regard to biological functions of the natural order. Another influential planning theorist of this time was [[Ebenezer Howard]], who founded the [[garden city movement]]. This movement formed communities with architecture in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts style]] at [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] and popularised the style as domestic architecture. In [[Vienna]], [[modern architecture|modernism]] had many theorists and proponents. An early use of the term "modern architecture" in print, was in the title of a book by [[Otto Wagner]],<ref>Otto Wagner. [http://books.google.com/books?id=AvgjAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA2&dq ''Moderne Architektur: Seinen Schülern ein Führer auf diesem Kunstgebiete.''] Anton Schroll. 1902.</ref><ref>Otto Wagner. Translated by Harry Francis Mallgrave. ''Modern Architecture: A Guidebook for His Students to This Field of Art.'' Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. 1988. ISBN 0226869385</ref> who gave examples of his own work representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] with [[art nouveau]] illustrations, and didactic teachings to his students. Soon thereafter, [[Adolf Loos]] wrote ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', and while his own style can be seen as part of the transition to [[Art Deco]], his demand for "the elimination of ornament" joined the slogan "[[form follows function]]" as a principle of the [[modern architecture]] movement which came to dominate the 20th Century. [[Walter Gropius]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Le Corbusier]] provided the theoretical basis for the [[International style (architecture)|international style]] with aims of using industrialised architecture to reshape society. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], while modernist in rejecting historic revivalism, was idiosyncratic in his theory, which he conveyed in copious writing. Wright did not subscribe to the tenets of the International Style, but evolved what he hoped would be an American, in contrast to a European, progressive course. Wright's style, however, was highly personal, involving his private views of man and nature. He created no major "school" or theoretical movement. Wright was more poetic and firmly maintained the 19th century view of the creative artist as unique genius. This limited the relevance of his theoretical propositions. Towards the end of the century [[postmodern architecture]] reacted against the austerity of High Modern (International Style) principles, viewed as narrowly normative and doctrinaire. ===Contemporary=== In contemporary architectural discourse theory has become more concerned with its position within culture generally, which is why university courses on architecture theory may often spend just as much time discussing philosophy and cultural studies as buildings. The notion that theory also entailed critique stemmed from post-structural [[literary studies]]. This, however, pushed architecture towards the notion of avant-gardism for its own sake - in many ways repeating the 19th century 'art for art's sake'
