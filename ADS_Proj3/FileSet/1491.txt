only if ∩''G''<sub>''n''</sub> = {1}. If two filtrations ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''G&prime;''<sub>''n''</sub> are defined on a group ''G'', then the identity map from ''G'' to ''G'', where the first copy of ''G'' is given the ''G''<sub>''n''</sub>-topology and the second the ''G&prime;''<sub>''n''</sub>-topology, is continuous if and only if for any ''n'' there is an ''m'' such that ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> ⊆''G&prime;''<sub>''n''</sub>, that is, if and only if the identity map is continuous at 1. In particular, the two filtrations define the same topology if and only if for any subgroup appearing in one there is a smaller or equal one appearing in the other. ====Rings and modules==== Given a ring ''R'' and an ''R''-module ''M'', a ''filtration'' of ''M'' is a decreasing sequence of submodules ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>. This is therefore a special case of the notion for groups, with the additional condition that the subgroups be submodules. The associated topology is defined as for groups. An important special case is known as the ''I''-adic topology (or ''J''-adic, etc.) Let ''R'' be a commutative ring, and ''I'' an ideal of ''R''. Given an ''R''-module ''M'', the sequence ''I<sup>n</sup>M'' of submodules of ''M'' forms a filtration of ''M''. The ''I-adic topology'' on ''M'' is then the topology associated to this filtration. If ''M'' is just the ring ''R'' itself, we have defined the ''I-adic topology'' on ''R''. When ''R'' is given the ''I''-adic topology, ''R'' becomes a [[topological ring]]. If an ''R''-module ''M'' is then given the ''I''-adic topology, it becomes a [[topological module|topological ''R''-module]], relative to the topology given on ''R''. ====Vector spaces==== {{Main|Flag (linear algebra)}} A filtration of a vector space is called a [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]]. ====Sets==== A maximal filtration of a set is equivalent to an ordering (a [[permutation]]) of the set. For instance, the filtration <math>\{0\} \subset \{0,1\} \subset \{0,1,2\}</math> corresponds to the ordering <math>(0,1,2)</math>. From the point of view of the [[field with one element]], an ordering on a set corresponds to a maximal [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]] (a filtration on a vector space), considering a set to be a vector space over the field with one element. ===Measure theory=== In [[measure theory]], in particular in [[martingale theory]] and the theory of [[stochastic process]]es, a filtration is an increasing [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] of [[sigma algebra|''&sigma;''-algebras]] on a [[measurable space]]. That is, given a measurable space <math>(\Omega, \mathcal{F})</math>, a filtration is a sequence of ''σ''-algebras <math>\{ \mathcal{F}_{t} \}_{t \geq 0}</math> with <math>\mathcal{F}_{t} \subseteq \mathcal{F}</math> for each ''t'' and :<math>t_{1} \leq t_{2} \implies \mathcal{F}_{t_{1}} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_{t_{2}}.</math> The exact range of the "times" ''t'' will usually depend on context: the set of values for ''t'' might be [[discrete set|discrete]] or continuous, [[bounded set|bounded]] or unbounded. For example, :<math>t \in \{ 0, 1, \dots, N \}, \mathbb{N}_{0}, [0, T] \mbox{ or } [0, + \infty).</math> Similarly, a '''filtered probability space''' (also known as a '''stochastic basis''') is a [[probability space]] with a filtration of its σ-algebra. It is also useful (in the case of an unbounded index set) to define <math>\mathcal{F}_{\infty}</math> as the ''σ''-algebra generated by the infinite union of the <math>\mathcal{F}_{t}</math>'s, which is contained in <math>\mathcal{F}</math>: :<math>\mathcal{F}_{\infty} = \sigma\left(\bigcup_{t \geq 0} \mathcal{F}_{t}\right) \subseteq \mathcal{F}.</math> A ''σ''-algebra defines the set of events that can be measured, which in a [[probability]] context is equivalent to events that can be discriminated, or "questions that can be answered at time ''t''". Therefore a filtration is often used to represent the change in the set of events that can be measured, through gain or loss of [[information]]. A typical example is in [[mathematical finance]], where a filtration represents the information available at each time ''t'', and is more and more precise (the set of measurable events is staying the same or increasing) as information from the present becomes available. ==See also== *[[Natural filtration]] ==References== * {{cite book | author=Øksendal, Bernt K. | authorlink=Bernt Øksendal | title=Stochastic Differential Equations: An Introduction with Applications | publisher=Springer| location=Berlin | year=2003 | isbn=3-540-04758-1}} [[Category:Algebra]] [[Category:Measure theory]] [[Category:Stochastic processes]] [[de:Filtrierung]] [[fr:Filtration (mathématiques)]] [[pl:Filtracja (matematyka)]] [[ru:Фильтрация (случайные процессы)]] [[uk:Фільтрація (випадкові процеси)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13575</id> <title>Final case</title> <text>'''Final case''' is used for marking ''final cause'' ("for a house").

A print from the [[foot]] can also leave an impression of friction ridges. A friction ridge is a raised portion of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] on the fingers and [[toe]]s (digits), the palm of the hand or the [[Sole (foot)|sole]] of the foot, consisting of one or more connected ridge units of friction ridge skin.<ref name=swglos /> These are sometimes known as "epidermal ridges" which are caused by the underlying interface between the dermal [[wiktionary:papilla|papillae]] of the dermis and the interpapillary (rete) pegs of the epidermis. These epidermal ridges serve to amplify [[vibration]]s triggered, for example, when fingertips brush across an uneven surface, better transmitting the signals to [[sensory nerve]]s involved in fine texture perception.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090129/full/news.2009.68.html "Fake finger reveals the secrets of touch"], ''[[Nature
