The attack focuses the need of a wireless network to receive the "Clear Channel Assessment"; which is a function within [[CSMA/CA]] to determine whether the wireless medium is ready and able to receive data, so that the transmitter may start sending it. The attack makes it appear that the airwaves are busy, which basically puts the entire system on hold. The attack works only on [[802.11b]], and is not effective on the OFDM-based protocols [[802.11g]] and [[802.11a]]. However, some hybrid 802.11b/g access points will hinder the 802.11g network when the 802.11b network is attacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/10072/12207/1/41331.pdf|title=Denial
