SecureLog is used in IT solutions that generates data to support [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] regulations like [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]]. == History == An algorithm used to make datalogs secure from manipulation. The first infrastructure supporting the algorithm was available on the Internet in 2006. == Operation == SecureLog involves an ''active key provider'', a ''managed data store'' and a ''verification provider''. ;Active Key Provider :An active key provider distributes active keys to subscribers. An active key contains encrypted data representing time and a private secret. An active key has a validity period that is set by the active key provider. ;Managed data store :The managed data store is a subscriber to the active keys delivered by the active key provider. The managed data store uses the active keys to do [[Assymetric key cryptography|asymmetric encryption]], [[Digital timestamping|timestamping]] and [[archive]] the data into a locked database. ;Verification provider :The verification provider may read segments from the locked database and verify content, timestamps and that the integrity of the data has not been broken or manipulated since it was saved. == Uses == The algorithm is used in several different use cases: ;Compliance issues :SecureLog is used to secure different types of data logs like access logs, email archives or transaction logs and is primarily in use where compliance might be an issue. ;The administrator weak link problem :One drawback with archiving solutions is that there is always an administrator that in the end has access to the information. This makes it difficult to trust the integrity of the data. SecureLog is used to solve the traditional administrator problem. == Proposed uses == ;Government use :In the public sector several laws handles the archiving of data. It has been proposed that SecureLog can be used by a free institution to lock government logs and stop them from potential manipulation. Several potential use cases has been identified by EDRI [http://www.edri.org/] ;The traffic logging problem :The method can be used by the public to monitor what data the government is collecting from the public. It has been proposed to be used as a method to solve the privacy issues in the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0024:EN:NOT EU Directive on Mandatory Retention of Communications Traffic Data] == References == *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0024:EN:NOT Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament] *[http://www.weatech.com Weatech] *USPTO patent 20060053294 [[Category:Cryptographic algorithms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33586</id> <title>Secure Computing</title> <text>{{For|the general concept|computer security}} {{Infobox_Company | company_name = Secure Computing Corporation | company_logo = [[Image:Secure_Computing_logo.jpg|Secure Logo]] | company_type = [[Public company|Public]] ([[NASDAQ]]: [http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=SCUR&selected=SCUR SCUR]) | company_slogan = Securing connections between people, applications, and networks | foundation = 1989 (spun off from [[Honeywell]]) | location = [[San Jose, California]] | key_people = Dan Ryan, President, CEO<br/>Richard Scott, Chairman | num_employees = ~1000 (2007) | industry = Security software and services| products = Security appliances and hosted services| revenue = $237.9 million [[United States dollar|USD]] (2007)| homepage = [http://www.securecomputing.com www.securecomputing.com] }} '''Secure Computing Corporation''', or '''SCC''', was a [[public company]] ({{nasdaq|SCUR}}) that developed and sold [[computer security]] appliances and hosted services to protect users and data.

The centerpiece of SCTC was its work on [[security-evaluated operating system]]s for the NSA. This work included the Secure Ada Target (SAT) and the Logical Coprocessing Kernel (LOCK), both designed to meet the stringent A1 level of the [[TCSEC|Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC). Secure Computing morphed itself from a small [[defense contractor]] into a commercial product vendor over the next several years. This was largely driven by the investment community, which was much less interested in purchasing security goods from defense contractors than from commercial product vendors, especially vendors in the growing [[Internet]] space. Secure Computing became a publicly traded company in 1995. Following the pattern of other [[Dot-com company|Internet-related startups]], the stock price tripled its first day: it opened at $16 a share and closed at $48. The price peaked around $64 in the next several weeks and then collapsed over the following year or so. It ranged between roughly $3 and $20 afterward until the company was purchased by McAfee. The company headquarters were moved to [[San Jose, California]] in 1998, though the bulk of the workforce remained in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]]. The Roseville employees completed a move to [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in February 2006. Several other sites now exist, largely the result of mergers (described below). ===Mergers and acquisitions=== Secure Computing consists of several merged units, one of the oldest being Enigma Logic, Inc., which was started around 1982. Bob Bosen, the founder, claims to have created the first [[security token]] to provide [[challenge-response authentication]]. Bosen published a [[computer game]] for the [[TRS-80]] [[home computer]] in 1979, called ''80 Space Raiders'', that used a simple challenge response mechanism for copy protection. People who used the mechanism encouraged him to repackage it for remote authentication. Bosen started Enigma Logic to do so, and filed for patents in 1982&ndash;3; a patent was issued in the United Kingdom in 1986. Ultimately, the ''challenge'' portion of
