the quality evaluation of online resources, the central negotiation process and the national licensing undertaken for each online resource. These services support the key aims of JISC Collections: *to support education and research by offering an affordable, relevant and sustainable collection of online resources *to widen accessibility to online resources *to save institutions and research councils time and money *to improve the management of licensing ==JISC Collections Strategy== '''JISC Collections''' negotiates, manages and acquires licence agreements for online resources that will support education and research and stakeholder requirements. In order to provide value and bring efficiencies to the academic sector the licenses must offer value for money and allow users to adapt the online resources to create teaching and learning materials within a personalised [[e-learning]] environment. This can be achieved though a central negotiation and national licensing process that saves institutions and content owners time and money. A recently published value for money report outlined precisely how much time and money is saved through national licensing arrangements. A sample analysis of some 22 resources which JISC provided through national agreement in the year 2004-05 revealed that the total savings to the education community through national agreements for these resources amounted to over £26m. With the annual costs for these resources less than £1m, such figures suggest that for every £1 spent on securing national agreements, the savings amounted to more than £26. The same report also analysed the time saved by the use of e-resources compared to the use of paper-based equivalents, interlibrary loans, institutionally held CD-ROMs, visits to libraries at alternative locations, etc., which all have time, cost and efficiency implications. These costs can be estimated, said the report, through savings in staff time gained through the use of e-resources. Using independent and publicly available figures, these access figures translate into efficiency savings for university staff active in teaching and research of nearly £156m in 2004-05. This suggests that the education and research community is gaining some 1.4 million person/days by using e-resources rather than paper-based equivalents. Such a scenario suggests that for every £1 spent on e-resource provision, the return to the community in value of time saved in information gathering is at least £18. JISC Collections aims to support and contribute to policy developments in e-learning and e-research by listening to the needs of and acting as a central point of contact for the academic the publishing sectors. Collaborative partnerships enable effective communications and allow JISC Collections to create new and innovative licensing and business models in line with e-learning, e-research and publishing developments. The current [http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/about_collections/coll_strat.aspx collections strategy] is under review. ==JISC Collections activities== The collections team undertakes a number of activities in collaboration with HE and FE institutions and content owners. JISC Collections is also supported by format based working groups made up of representatives of the education community and technical experts. The groups advise JISC Collections on the acquisition of content and provide guidance on licensing and collection building strategies. The groups are: [[e-books]], e-journals, geospatial data, images and online film and sound. The groups work with JISC and JISC Collections and often commission studies and reports. ===Exploring new online resources=== There are three ways in which an online resource is suggested for evaluation; librarians in institutions inform the collections team of requests from users, a content owner approaches the team or a member of a working group puts forward a suggestion. Following a suggestion the team explores the online resource to check that it is not already included in the Collection, that it is not already being licensed nationally to institutions and that it meets the initial requirements. A collections manager will then set up a meeting with the content owner to inform them of the guidelines, the evaluation criteria and the licensing requirements. ====Guidelines==== JISC Collections publishes a number of guidelines for content owners. Content owners are not required to meet all of the guidelines, however it is suggested that as many are met as possible in order to increase visibility, functionality and use of their resources. The guidelines focus on subjects such as [[metadata]], [[Rss|RSS feeds]], [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/themes/access_management/federation.aspx access management] and open URL compliance. [http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/about_collections/coll_jiscfactfile.aspx JISC Collections guidelines] ====Evaluation criteria==== The evaluation criteria assess whether the online resource meets the strategic, business, licensing standards and offers benefits to the academic community. For an online resource to be taken forward the content owner must agree to [http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/help_and_contact/coll_allbanding.aspx JISC banding], to implement [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/themes/access_management/federation.aspx JISC access management solutions] and to use the [http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/model_licence.aspx JISC Model Licence]. ====Licensing requirements==== JISC Collections uses a model licence as the basis for all licence negotiations. The model licence was originally formed from a JISC and Publishers Association working party and has been updated annually to take into account new teaching, research, institutional and technological developments. The model licence helps JISC Collections maintain consistency and negotiate for the best possible terms and conditions of use whilst also respecting the content owners needs. [http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/model_licence/coll_guide_jiscmodel.aspx Guide to the model licence] [http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/model_licence/coll_guide_jiscmodel_video.aspx A Guide to the Model Licence Video] ===Evaluating online resource=== Following successful initial discussions, the collections manager will carry out a consultation with the institutions to assess the online resource. The consultation document includes information on proposed pricing, content, functionality and offers institutions the option of a free trial. The document is placed on the JISC Collections website and the library community is informed of its existence, invited to trial the resource and then feedback comments from their users to JISC Collections. Institutions are not required to read the consultation document, request a trial or feedback comments, it is an opt-in process. This means that results to consultations vary according to resource content and the time it was issued. The results of the consultation allow the collections manager to assess demand, relevance, pricing and to discover any issues with the content or functionality that have been identified. The results of the consultation are shared with content owner and a decision to move forward to a licence based on the outcomes of
