LPI was introduced in 1970 by Polish - Swiss mathematician [[Edward Kofler]] (1911–2007) to simplify [[Decision making|decision]] processes. Comparing to [[Fuzzy set|other methods]] the LPI-fuzziness is [[algorithm]]ically simple and particularly in [[decision making]], more practically oriented. Instead of an [[indicator function]] the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness by establishing of linear restrictions for fuzzy probability distributions or normalized weights. In the LPI-procedure the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness instead of applying a membership function. This can be done by establishing [[stochastic]] and non-stochastic LPI-relations. A mixed stochastic and non-stochastic fuzzification is often a basis for the LPI-procedure. By using the LPI-methods any fuzziness in any decision situation can be considered on the base of the [[linear]] [[fuzzy logic]]. == Definition == <br clear="all"/> <blockquote style="padding:1em; border:.3ex dotted #036;"> Any Stochastic Partial Information '''SPI(p)''', which can be considered as a solution of a [[linear]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] [[system]], is called Linear Partial Information '''LPI(p)''' about probability '''p'''. It can be considered as an LPI-fuzzification of the probability '''p''' corresponding to the concepts of linear fuzzy logic. </blockquote> == Applications == a) The MaxEmin Principle<BR> To obtain the maximally warranted [[expected value]], the decision maker has to choose the [[strategy]] which maximizes the minimal [[expected value]]. This procedure leads to the MaxEmin - Principle and is an [[Extension (mathematics)|extension]] of the [[Bernoulli's principle]].<BR> b) The MaxWmin Principle<BR> This principle leads to the maximal guaranteed [[weight function]], regarding the extreme weights.<BR> c) The Prognostic Decision Principle (PDP)<BR> This principle is based on the [[prognostic|prognosis]] interpretation of strategies under fuzziness.<BR> == Fuzzy equilibrium and stability == Despite the fuzziness of information, it is often necessary to choose the optimal, most cautious strategy, for example in economic planning, in conflict situations or in daily decisions. This is impossible without the concept of fuzzy equilibrium. The concept of fuzzy stability is considered as an extension into a time interval, taking into account the corresponding stability area of the decision maker. The more complex is the model, the softer a choice has to be considered. The idea of fuzzy equilibrium is based on the optimization principles. Therefore the MaxEmin-, MaxGmin- and PDP-stability have to be analyzed. The violation of these principles leads often to wrong predictions and decisions. == LPI equilibrium point == Considering a given LPI-decision model, as a [[convolution]] of the corresponding fuzzy states or a disturbance set, the fuzzy equilibrium strategy remains the most cautious one, despite of the presence of the fuzziness. Any deviation from this strategy can cause a loss for the decision maker. == See also == <div style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"> * [[Edward Kofler]] * [[Fuzzy set]] * [[Game theory]] * [[Defuzzification]] * [[Fuzziness]] * [[Stochastic process]] * [[Deterministic]] * [[Probability distribution]] * [[Uncertainty]] * [[Vagueness]] * [[Optimization (mathematics)]] * [[Logic]] * [[List of mathematics articles (L)]] * [[List of set theory topics]] </div> ==External links== *[http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=148552859&ETOC=RN&from=searchengine/ Tools for establishing dominance with linear partial information and attribute hierarchy] *[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/01650114/2001/00000118/00000001/art00088/ Linear Partial Information with applications] * [http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/intfor/v4y1988i1p15-32.html/ Linear Partial Information (LPI) with applications to the U.S. economic policy] *[http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeintfor/v_3A4_3Ay_3A1988_3Ai_3A1_3Ap_3A15-32.htm/ Practical decision making with Linear Partial Information (LPI)] *[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VCT-4BX7BW4-4&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F01%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e1735a0f47f792026d9d5b189bdc4959/ Stochastic programming with fuzzy linear partial information on probability distribution] *[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l625g27848x67v0j/ One-shot decisions under Linear Partial Information] ==Selected references== * Edward Kofler - Equilibrium Points, Stability and Regulation in Fuzzy Optimisation Systems under Linear Partial Stochastic Information (LPI), [[Proceedings]] of the International Congress of [[Cybernetics]] and Systems, AFCET, Paris 1984, pp. 233–240 * Edward Kofler - [[Decision making|Decision Making]] under Linear Partial Information.

Atomicity is a guarantee of [[Isolation (computer science)|isolation]] from [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent processes]]. Additionally, atomic operations commonly have a [[Atomicity (database systems)|succeed-or-fail]] definition — they either successfully change the state of the system, or have no visible effect. Atomicity is commonly enforced by [[mutual exclusion]], whether at the hardware level building on a [[cache coherency]] protocol, or the software level using [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or [[lock (computer science)|locks]]. Thus, an atomic operation does not ''actually'' occur instantaneously. The benefit comes from the ''appearance'': the system behaves ''as if'' each operation occurred instantly, separated by pauses. Because of this, implementation details may be ignored by the user, except insofar as they affect performance. If an operation is not atomic, the user will also need to understand and cope with sporadic extraneous behaviour caused by interactions between
