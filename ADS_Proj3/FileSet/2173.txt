ideology and technology of parallel processing and distributed modelling and management in open dynamic systems. Technology is protected by European patent and two monographs, published by John Wiley & Sons; <br /> - Developed a universal module for managing components of technical systems that can communicate with other modules in a special scripting language distributed for the purpose of gradual transition to unmanned distributed systems that provide autonomous decision-making in critical situations; <br /> - Put into trial operation at the facilities of the pilot system design, "Monitoring of potentially dangerous military sites; <br /> - Developed three-tier model of decision support system (among Windows XP, ORACLE DBMS and ArcMap) for management of forces and means of Ukraine's Armed Forces during emergencies; <br /> - The system of accounting accumulation, movement and resource use logistic nomenclatures naval forces of Ukraine and Current planning logistics Navy of Ukraine; <br /> - Created, developed and used in practice physical-probabilistic theory of reliability of computer technology and automation systems. Based on the results from the fundamental mathematical tool that has no analogues in the world, allows the use of new more accurate methods for evaluating the residual life of mechanical and electrical equipment; <br /> - The new probabilistic-physical and cyber information and approaches to design, develop and implement guaranteed steady and secure information-control computer real-time systems based on highly reliable (dependable) and fault tolerant computing facilities; <br /> - In order DSC Office of the Parliament of Ukraine, HK Kievgorstroy and Zhytloinvest and other organizations created and put into effect dozens of automation systems to construction sites in Kiev (annually about 500 systems); <br /> - Developed and implemented energy-efficient LED lighting system. Carried equipment Kiev subway cars test specimens saving LED fixtures and systems management, allowing several times to reduce energy consumption; <br /> - Developed and experimentally tested a new structural model of grayscale images, which allows you to create software processing grayscale images relatively invariant to affine transformations of objects in images. Research results form the basis for development of telemedical diagnostic system ONCOTEST WM-01 ", to effectively perform screening of cancer in the early stages of cancer. == International Institute accreditation == IMMSP NASU accredited certification body as quality management systems in the international certification SIC, which passed accreditation with the European standards (EN 45011). The members of this body is testing laboratory "UKRSERTKOMPYUTER OS, which is also accredited by State Standard of Ukraine and National Accreditation Agency of Ukraine (NAAU) per international standard EN ISO / EN 17025. == Scientific Schools == According to the main direction of NASU Research IMMSP emerged and operates under the direction of Corresponding Member of NAS of Ukraine Prof. A. Morozov Scientific School "Theory and practice of intelligent systems support collective decision making (type Situation Centre). == Scientific activities == With modern electronic technology in place IMMSP NASU traditional and interactive conferences and seminars that allow you to combine the efforts of scientists around the world. For such events have become traditional with international participation as a remote on-line conference "decision support system. Theory and Practice and Scientific Conference "Mathematical and simulation systems. MODS. == Newspapers == IMMSP NASU produces scientific journal "Mathematical machines and systems". The journal publishes original and review articles of scientific and technical nature, reports on meetings, conferences, reviews of books, materials and the discussion of problem == Web Resources == * [http://www.immsp.kiev.ua/eng/index.html Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine] [[Category: Science and technology in Ukraine]] [[Category: Research organizations]] [[Category: Computers]] [[Category: Scientific institutions]] [[Category: Scientific organizations]] [[Category: Research institutes in Ukraine]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18540</id> <title>Institute of Mathematics and its Applications</title> <text>{{distinguish2|the [[Institute for Mathematics and its Applications|Institute '''for''' Mathematics and its Applications]] in Minneapolis}} {{redirect3|FIMA|Not to be confused with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]|FEMA}} '''The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications''' ('''IMA''') is the UK's [[Royal Charter|chartered]] [[British professional bodies|professional body]] for [[mathematician]]s and one of the UK's [[Learned society|learned societies]] for mathematics (the other main one being the [[London Mathematical Society]]).
