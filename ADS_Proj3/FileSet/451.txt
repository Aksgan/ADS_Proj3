first to base its [[ontology]] on chemistry which allows 3D representation of molecular interactions. The underlying chemistry allows molecular interactions to be described down to the atomic level of resolution.<ref name= "2005 update"/> PreBIND an associated system for data mining to locate biomolecular interaction information in the scientific literature. The name or [[accession number]] of a protein can be entered and PreBIND will scan the literature and return a list of potentially interacting proteins. BIND [[BLAST]] is also available to find interactions with proteins that are similar to the one specified in the query.<ref name= "2005 update"/> BIND offers several “features” that many other proteomics databases do not include. The authors of this program have created an extension to traditional [[IUPAC]] nomenclature to help describe [[post-translational modifications]] that occur to amino acids. These modifications include: [[acetylation]], [[formylation]], [[methylation]], [[palmitoylation]], etc. the extension of the traditional IUPAC codes allows these amino acids to be represented in sequence form as well. BIND also utilizes a unique visualization tool known as [[OntoGlyphs]]. The OntoGlyphs were developed based on [[Gene Ontology]] (GO) and provide a link back to the original GO information. A number of GO terms have been grouped into categories, each one representing a specific function, binding specificity, or localization in the cell. There are 83 OntoGlyph characters in total. There are 34 functional OntoGlyphs which contain information about the role of the molecule (e.g. cell physiology, ion transport, signaling). There are 25 binding OntoGlyphs which describe what the molecule binds (e.g. ligands, DNA, ions). The other 24 OntoGlyphs provide information about the location of the molecule within a cell (e.g. nucleus, cytoskeleton). The OntoGlyphs can be selected and manipulated to include or exclude certain characteristics from search results. The visual nature of the OntoGlyphs also facilitates pattern recognition when looking at search results. <ref name= "2005 update"/> [[ProteoGlyphs]] are graphical representations of the structural and binding properties of proteins at the level of conserved domains. The protein is diagrammed as a straight horizontal line and glyphs are inserted to represent conserved domains. Each glyph is displayed to represent the relative position and length of its alignment in the protein sequence. ===Accessing the database=== [[Image:Copy of BIND Screen.JPG|thumb|Figure 1: Screen shot of sequence results obtained using BOND]] The database user interface is web-based and can be queried using text or accession numbers/identifiers. Since its integration with the other components of BOND, sequences have been added to interactions, molecular complexes and pathways in the results. Records include information on: BIND ID, description of the interaction/complex/pathway, publications, update records, organism, OntoGlyphs, ProteoGlyphs, and links to other databases where additional information can be found. BIND records include various viewing formats (e.g. [[HTML]], [[ASN.1]], [[XML]], [[FASTA]]), various formats for exporting results (e.g. ASN.1, [[XML]], [[GI list]], [[PDF]]), and visualizations (e.g. [[Cytoscape]]). The exact viewing and exporting options vary depending on what type of data has been retrieved. ==User statistics== The number of Unleashed Registrants has increased 10 fold since the integration of BIND. As of December 2006 registration fell just short of 10,000. Subscribers to the commercial versions of BOND fall into six general categories; [[agriculture]] and [[food]], [[biotechnology]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[Information technology|informatics]], [[materials]] and other. The biotechnology sector is the largest of these groups, holding 28% of subscriptions. Pharmaceuticals and informatics follow with 22% and 18% respectively. The [[United States]] holds the bulk of these subscriptions, 69%. Other countries with access to the commercial versions of BOND include [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[India]] and [[Australia]]. All of these countries fall below 6% in user share.<ref name= "BOND"/> ==References== <references /> [[Category:Biological databases]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3929</id> <title>Biopython</title> <text>{{Infobox Software |name = Biopython |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |collapsible = |author = |developer = |released = |latest release version = 1.56 |latest release date = {{release date and age|2010|11|26|df=yes}} |frequently updated = |programming language = [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and some [[C (programming language)|C]] |operating system = |platform = Cross-platform |size = |language = |status = Active |genre = [[Bioinformatics]] |license = [http://www.biopython.org/DIST/LICENSE Biopython License] |website = [http://biopython.org/ biopython.org] }} The '''Biopython''' Project is an international association of developers of freely available [[Python (programming language)|Python]] tools for computational molecular biology, as well as [[bioinformatics]]. == See also == * [[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]] * [[BioSQL]] * [[BioPerl]] * [[BioRuby]] ==References== *{{cite journal | author = Cock PJ, Antao T, Chang JT, ''et al.'' | title = Biopython: freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology and bioinformatics | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 1422–3 | year = 2009 | month = June | pmid = 19304878 | pmc = 2682512 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp163 | url = }} *refer to the Biopython website for other [http://biopython.org/wiki/Documentation#Papers papers describing Biopython], and a list of over one hundred [http://biopython.org/wiki/Publications publications using/citing Biopython]. == External links == * [http://biopython.org Biopython.org] * [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook] ([http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf PDF]) [[Category:Bioinformatics software]] [[Category:Computational science]] {{science-org-stub}} {{bioinformatics-stub}} [[ar:بايو بايثون]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3935</id> <title>Biostatistics</title> <text>{{about||the automated recognition of people based on intrinsic physical or behavioural traits|Biometrics|the academic journal|Biostatistics (journal)|the journal related to Biometry|Biometrics (journal)}} '''Biostatistics''' (a contraction of biology and statistics; sometimes referred to as '''biometry''' or '''biometrics''') is the application of [[statistics]] to a wide range of topics in [[biology]]. The science of biostatistics encompasses the design of biological experiments, especially in [[medicine]] and [[agriculture]]; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. == Biostatistics and the history of biological thought == Biostatistical reasoning and modeling were of critical importance to the foundation theories of modern biology. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work, the conceptual gaps in understanding between [[genetics]] and evolutionary [[Darwinism]] led to vigorous debate between biometricians such as [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter Weldon]] and [[Karl Pearson]] and Mendelians such as [[Charles Benedict Davenport|Charles Davenport]], [[William Bateson]] and [[Wilhelm Johannsen]]. By the 1930s statisticians and models built on statistical reasoning had helped to
