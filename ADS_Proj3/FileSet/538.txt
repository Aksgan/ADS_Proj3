Bugs was the official mascot of Kingman Army Air Field, Kingman, Arizona, where thousands of aerial gunners were trained during World War II. Some notable trainees included [[Clark Gable]] and [[Charles Bronson]]. Bugs also served as the mascot for 530 Squadron of the 380th Bombardment Group, [[5th Air Force]], [[U.S. Air Force]], which was attached to the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and operated out of Australia's [[Northern Territory]] from 1943 to 1945, flying [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://380th.org/380-History.html |title=History of the 380th Bomb Group |publisher=380th.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref> Bugs riding an air delivered torpedo served as the squadron logo for Marine Torpedo/Bomber Squadron 242 in the Second World War. In 1944, Bugs Bunny made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''Jasper Goes Hunting'', a short produced by rival studio [[Paramount Pictures]]. In this cameo (animated by Robert McKimson, with Mel Blanc providing the voice), Bugs pops out of a rabbit hole, saying his usual catchphrase; Bugs then says, "I must be in the wrong picture" and then goes back in the hole.<ref name="Jasper"/> He also appears fleetingly in the 1947 [[Arthur Davis (animator)|Arthur Davis]] cartoon ''[[The Goofy Gophers]]'' === The post-war era === After World War II Bugs appeared in numerous cartoon shorts in the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series, making his last appearance in the theatrical cartoons in 1964 with ''[[False Hare]]''. He was directed by Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson, Arthur Davis and Chuck Jones and appeared in feature films, including ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (which features the first-ever meeting between Bugs and his box-office rival [[Mickey Mouse]]), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (which co-starred [[Michael Jordan]]), and the 2003 movie ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]].'' The Bugs Bunny short ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' (1958), in which a medieval Bugs Bunny trades blows with [[Yosemite Sam]] and his fire-breathing dragon (which has a cold), won the [[Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] of 1958. Three of Chuck Jones' Bugs Bunny shorts—''[[Rabbit Fire]]'', ''[[Rabbit Seasoning]]'', and ''[[Duck, Rabbit, Duck!]]''—comprise what is often referred to as the "Duck Season/Rabbit Season" trilogy, and are considered among the director's best works.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Jones' 1957 classic, ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'', cast Bugs and Elmer in a parody of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''. It has been deemed "culturally significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], the first cartoon short to receive this honor. In the fall of 1960, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] debuted the prime-time television program ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]''. This show packaged many of the post-1948 Warners shorts with newly animated wraparounds. After two seasons, it was moved from its evening slot to reruns on Saturday mornings. ''The Bugs Bunny Show'' changed format and exact title frequently, but remained on network television for 40 years. The packaging was later completely different, with each short simply presented on its own, title and all, though some clips from the new bridging material were sometimes used as filler. === After the classic cartoon era === When Mel Blanc died in 1989, [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[Billy West]] became the new voices to Bugs Bunny and the rest of the ''Looney Tunes'', taking turns doing the voices at various times. Bugs has made appearances in animated specials for network television, mostly composed of classic cartoons with bridging material added, including ''How Bugs Bunny Won the West'', and ''The Bugs Bunny Mystery Special''. 1980's ''Bugs Bunny's Busting Out All Over'', however, contained no vintage clips and featured the first new Bugs Bunny cartoons in 16 years. It opened with "Portrait Of The Artist As a Young Bunny", which features a flashback of Bugs as a child thwarting a young Elmer Fudd, while its third and closing short was "Spaced Out Bunny", with Bugs being kidnapped by [[Marvin the Martian]] to be a playmate for Hugo, an [[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]-like character. (A new [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] short filled out the half hour.) Compilation films included the independently produced ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', using the vintage shorts then owned by [[United Artists]]; as well as Warner Bros. efforts ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]'', ''[[The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie]]'', ''[[Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales]]'' and ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]''. He also made guest appearances in episodes of the 1990s television program ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' as the principal of [[Acme Looniversity]] and the mentor of [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], and would later make occasional guest cameos on spinoffs ''[[Taz-Mania]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Histeria!]]'' He appears in the beginning of ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', where he tries to ride the opening Warner Bros logo, but is interrupted by Daffy Duck.

Art by [[Robert McKimson]].]] Bugs has had several [[comic book]] series over the years. [[Western Publishing]] had the license for all the Warner Brothers cartoons, and produced Bugs Bunny comics first for [[Dell Comics]], then later for their own [[Gold Key Comics]]. Dell published 58 issues and several specials from 1952 to 1962. Gold Key continued for another 133 issues. [[DC Comics]], the sister/subsidiary company of Warner Bros., has published several comics titles since 1994 that Bugs has appeared in. Notable among these was the 2000 four-issue miniseries ''Superman & Bugs Bunny'', written by [[Mark Evanier]] and drawn by [[Joe Staton]]. This depicted a [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] between DC's superheroes and the Warner cartoon characters. [[File:Bugs Bunny Walk of Fame 4-20-06.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Bugs Bunny's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]] Like Spongebob for [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], Bugs has served as the mascot for [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]] and its various divisions. He and Mickey are the first cartoon characters to have a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In the 1988 animated/live action movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', Bugs was shown as one of the inhabitants of [[Toontown]]. However, since the film was being produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]], Warner Bros. would only allow the use of their biggest star if he got an
