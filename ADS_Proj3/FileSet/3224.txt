routing to allow up to 4 network cards in a server). In 1989, with the [[Intel 80386]] available, Novell released NetWare 386. Later Novell consolidated the numbering of their NetWare releases, with NetWare 386 becoming NetWare 3.x. === NetWare 286 2.x === NetWare version 2 had a reputation as notoriously difficult to configure, since the operating system was provided as a set of compiled [[object module]]s that required configuration and linking. Compounding this inconvenience was that the process was designed to run from multiple [[diskette]]s, which was slow and unreliable. Any change to the operating system required a re-linking of the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and a reboot of the system, requiring at least 20 diskette swaps. An additional complication in early versions was that the installation contained a proprietary low-level format program for [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] hard drives, which was run automatically before the software could be loaded, called COMPSURF. NetWare was administered using text-based utilities such as SYSCON. The file system used by NetWare 2 was [[NetWare File System]] 286, or NWFS 286, supporting volumes of up to 256 MB. NetWare 286 recognized 80286 [[protected mode]], extending NetWare's support of RAM from 1 MB to the full 16 MB addressable by the 80286. A minimum of 2 MB was required to start up the operating system; any additional RAM was used for FAT, DET and file caching. Since 16-bit protected mode was implemented the i80286 and every subsequent Intel x86 processor, NetWare 286 version 2.x would run on any 80286 or later compatible processor. NetWare 2 implemented a number of features inspired by [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[minicomputer]] systems that were not available in other [[operating systems]] of the day. The ''[[System Fault Tolerance|System Fault Tolerance (SFT)]]'' features included standard read-after-write verification (SFT-I) with on-the-fly bad block re-mapping (at the time, disks did not have that feature built in) and software [[RAID1]] (disk mirroring, SFT-II). The [[Transaction Tracking System]] (TTS) optionally protected files against incomplete updates. For single files, this required only a file attribute to be set. Transactions over multiple files and controlled roll-backs were possible by programming to the TTS [[API]]. NetWare 286 2.x supported two modes of operation: dedicated and non-dedicated. In dedicated mode, the server used DOS only as a [[boot loader]] to execute the operating system file net$os.exe. All memory was allocated to NetWare; no DOS ran on the server. For non-dedicated operation, DOS 3.3 or higher would remain in memory, and the processor would time-slice between the DOS and NetWare programs, allowing the server computer to be used simultaneously as a network file-server and as a user workstation. All [[extended memory]] (RAM above 1 MB) was allocated to NetWare, so DOS was limited to only 640kB; [[expanded memory]] managers that used the MMU of 80386 and higher processors, such as EMM386, would not work either, because NetWare 286 had control of protected mode and the upper RAM, both of which were required for DOS to use this approach to [[expanded memory]]; 8086-style expanded memory on dedicated plug-in cards was possible however. Time slicing was accomplished using the keyboard [[interrupt]]. This feature required strict compliance with the IBM PC design model, otherwise performance was affected. Non-dedicated NetWare was popular on small networks, although it was more susceptible to lockups due to DOS program problems. In some implementations, users would experience significant network slowdown when someone was using the console as a workstation. NetWare 386 3.x and later supported only dedicated operation. Server licensing on early versions of NetWare 286 was accomplished by using a key card. The key card was designed for an 8-bit ISA bus, and had a serial number encoded on a ROM chip. The serial number had to match the serial number of the NetWare software running on the server. To broaden the hardware base, particularly to machines using the IBM MCA bus, later versions of NetWare 2.x did not require the key card; serialised license floppy disks were used in place of the key cards. === NetWare 3.x === Starting with NetWare 3.x, support for 32-bit [[protected mode]] was added, eliminating the 16 MB memory limit of NetWare 286. This allowed larger hard drives to be supported, since NetWare 3.x cached (copied) the entire [[file allocation table]] (FAT) and [[directory entry table]] (DET) into memory for improved performance. By accident or design, the initial releases of the client TSR programs modified the high 16 bits of the 32-bit 80386 registers, making them unusable by any other program until this was fixed. [[Phil Katz]] noticed the problem and added a switch to his [[PKZIP]] suite of programs to enable 32-bit register use only when the Netware TSRs were not present. NetWare version 3 eased development and administration by modularization. Each functionality was controlled by a software module called a [[NetWare Loadable Module]] (NLM) loaded either at startup or when it was needed. It was then possible to add functionality such as anti-virus software, backup software, database and web servers, long name support (standard filenames were limited to 8 characters plus a three letter extension, matching [[MS-DOS]]) or [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] style files. NetWare continued to be administered using console-based utilities. The file system introduced by NetWare 3.x and used by default until NetWare 5.x was [[NetWare File System]] 386, or NWFS 386, which significantly extended volume capacity (1 TB, 4 GB files) and could handle up to 16 volume segments spanning multiple physical disk drives. Volume segments could be added while the server was in use and the volume was mounted, allowing a server to be expanded without interruption. Initially, NetWare used ''Bindery services'' for authentication. This was a stand-alone database system where all user access and security data resided individually on each server. When an infrastructure contained more than one server, users had to log-in to each of them individually, and each server had to be configured with the list of all allowed users. The "NetWare Name Services" product allowed user data to be extended across multiple servers, and the Windows "Domain"
