moves at or near the platter speed. The record and playback head are mounted on a block called a slider, and the surface next to the platter is shaped to keep it just barely out of contact. This forms a type of air bearing. In modern drives, the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects. To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a 3-atom layer of the non-magnetic element [[ruthenium]], and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other.<ref>Brian Hayes, [http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/14750 Terabyte Territory], ''[[American Scientist]]'', Vol 90 No 3 (May–June 2002) p. 212</ref> Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is [[perpendicular recording]], first shipped in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2004_12/pr1401.htm |title=Press Releases December 14, 2004 |publisher=Toshiba |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/laptops/momentus/|title=Seagate Momentus 2½" HDDs per webpage Jan 2008 |publisher=Seagate.com |date=2008-10-24 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/desktops/barracuda_hard_drives/|title=Seagate Barracuda 3½" HDDs per webpage January 2008 |publisher=Seagate.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdc.com/en/company/investor/q108remarks.asp|title=Western Digital Scorpio 2½" and Greenpower 3½" HDDs per quarterly conference, July 2007|publisher=Wdc.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> ===Components=== [[Image:Hard disk dismantled.jpg|thumb|left|A hard disk drive with the disks and motor hub removed showing the copper colored stator coils surrounding a bearing at the center of the spindle motor. The orange stripe along the side of the arm is a thin printed-circuit cable. The spindle bearing is in the center. The actuator is in the upper left.]] A typical hard disk drive has two electric motors; a disk motor to spin the disks and an actuator (motor) to position the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator at the end of the head support arm is the read-write head (near center in photo); thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. A flexible, somewhat U-shaped, ribbon cable, seen edge-on below and to the left of the actuator arm continues the connection to the controller board on the opposite side. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 [[g-force|''G''s]]. The silver-colored structure at the upper left of the first image is the top plate of the actuator, a permanent-magnet and moving coil motor that swings the heads to the desired position (it is shown removed in the second image). The plate supports a squat [[neodymium magnet|neodymium-iron-boron]] (NIB) high-flux [[magnet]]. Beneath this plate is the moving coil, often referred to as the ''[[voice coil]]'' by analogy to the coil in [[loudspeaker]]s, which is attached to the actuator hub, and beneath that is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the bottom plate of the motor (some drives only have one magnet). The voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead, and made of doubly coated copper [[magnet wire]]. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds the coil together after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead (which point to the actuator bearing center) interact with the [[magnetic field]], developing a tangential force that rotates the actuator. Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the [[magnetic field#Force on a charged particle|tangential force]]. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore the surface of the magnet is half N pole, half S pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head. ===Error handling=== Modern drives also make extensive use of [[Error Correcting Code]]s (ECCs), particularly [[Reed–Solomon error correction]]. These techniques store extra bits for each block of data that are determined by mathematical formulas. The extra bits allow many errors to be fixed. While these extra bits take up space on the hard drive, they allow higher recording densities to be employed, resulting in much larger storage capacity for user data.<ref>[http://www.storagereview.com/guide2000/ref/hdd/geom/errorECC.html Error Correcting Code], Storage Review</ref> In 2009, in the newest drives, [[low-density parity-check code]]s (LDPC) are supplanting Reed-Solomon. LDPC codes enable performance close to the [[Shannon Limit]] and thus allow for the highest storage density available.<ref>[http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/FB376A33027F5A5F86257509001463AE/$file/IDRC_WP_final.pdf "Iterative Detection Read Channel Technology in Hard Disk Drives"], Hitachi</ref> Typical hard drives attempt to "remap" the data in a physical sector that is going bad to a spare physical sector—hopefully while the errors in that bad sector are still few enough that the ECC can recover the data without loss. The [[S.M.A.R.T.]] system counts the total number of errors in the entire hard drive fixed by ECC, and the total number of remappings, in an attempt to predict hard drive failure. ===Future development=== Because of bit-flipping errors and other issues, perpendicular recording densities may be supplanted by other magnetic recording technologies.

All major components were placed on a mirror, which created the symmetrical reflections.]] Hard disk manufacturers quote disk capacity in multiples of [[SI prefix|SI]]-standard powers of 1000, where a ''terabyte'' is 1000 gigabytes and a ''gigabyte'' is 1000 megabytes. With [[file system]]s that report capacity in powers of 1024, available space appears somewhat less than advertised capacity. The discrepancy between the
