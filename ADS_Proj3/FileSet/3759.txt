diagnostic tests rest heavily on the model assumptions. Although examination of the residuals can be used to invalidate a model, the results of a [[t-test]] or [[F-test]] are sometimes more difficult to interpret if the model's assumptions are violated. For example, if the error term does not have a normal distribution, in small samples the estimated parameters will not follow normal distributions and complicate inference. With relatively large samples, however, a [[central limit theorem]] can be invoked such that hypothesis testing may proceed using asymptotic approximations. ===Regression with "limited dependent" variables=== The phrase "limited dependent" is used in [[econometric]] statistics for categorical and constrained variables. The response variable may be non-continuous ("limited" to lie on some subset of the real line). For binary (zero or one) variables, if analysis proceeds with least-squares linear regression, the model is called the [[linear probability model]]. Nonlinear models for binary dependent variables include the [[probit model|probit]] and [[logistic regression|logit model]]. The [[multivariate probit]] model is a standard method of estimating a joint relationship between several binary dependent variables and some independent variables. For [[categorical variable]]s with more than two values there is the [[multinomial logit]]. For [[ordinal variable]]s with more than two values, there are the [[ordered logit]] and [[ordered probit]] models. [[Censored regression model]]s may be used when the dependent variable is only sometimes observed, and [[Heckman correction]] type models may be used when the sample is not randomly selected from the population of interest. An alternative to such procedures is linear regression based on [[polychoric correlation]] (or polyserial correlations) between the categorical variables. Such procedures differ in the assumptions made about the distribution of the variables in the population. If the variable is positive with low values and represents the repetition of the occurrence of an event, then count models like the [[Poisson regression]] or the [[negative binomial]] model may be used. ==Interpolation and extrapolation== Regression models predict a value of the ''Y'' variable given known values of the ''X'' variables. Prediction within the range of values in the dataset used for model-fitting is known informally as [[interpolation]]. Prediction outside this range of the data is known as [[extrapolation]]. Performing extrapolation relies strongly on the regression assumptions. The further the extrapolation goes outside the data, the more room there is for the model to fail due to differences between the assumptions and the sample data or the true values. For example, regression model failing the homoscedasticity assumption will make bigger mistakes the further out the extrapolation is {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. It is generally advised {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} that when performing extrapolation, one should accompany the estimated value of the dependent variable with a prediction interval that represents the uncertainty. Such intervals tend to expand rapidly as the values of the independent variable(s) moved outside the range covered by the observed data. For such reasons and others, some tend to say that it might be unwise to undertake extrapolation.<ref>Chiang, C.L, (2003) ''Statistical methods of analysis'', World Scientific.

A properly conducted regression analysis will include an assessment of how well the assumed form is matched by the observed data, but it can only do so within the range of values of the independent variables actually available. This means that any extrapolation is particularly reliant on the assumptions being made about the structural form of the regression relationship. Best-practice advice here is that a linear-in-variables and linear-in-parameters relationship should not be chosen simply for computational convenience, but that all available knowledge should be deployed in constructing a regression model. If this knowledge includes the fact that the dependent variable cannot go outside a certain range of values, this can be made use of in selecting the model &mdash; even if the observed dataset has no values particularly near such bounds. The implications of this step of choosing an appropriate functional form for the regression can be great when extrapolation is considered. At a minimum, it can ensure that any extrapolation arising from a fitted model is "realistic" (or in accord with what is known). ==Nonlinear regression== {{Main|Nonlinear regression}} When the model function is not linear in the parameters, the sum of squares must be minimized by an iterative procedure. This introduces many complications which are summarized in [[least squares#Differences between linear and non-linear least squares|Differences between linear and non-linear least squares]] ==Power and sample size calculations== There are no generally agreed methods for relating the number of observations versus the number of independent variables in the model. One rule of thumb suggested by Good and Hardin is <math>N=m^n</math>, where <math>N</math> is the sample size, <math>n</math> is the number of independent variables and <math>m</math> is the number of observations needed to reach the desired precision if the model had only one independent variable.<ref>{{cite book|author=Good PI, Hardin JW|title=Common Errors in Statistics (And How to Avoid Them)|publisher=Wiley|edition=3rd|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|year=2009|page=211|isbn=978-0-470-45798-6}}</ref> For example, a researcher is building a linear regression model using a dataset that contains 1000 patients (<math>N</math>). If he decides that five observations are needed to precisely define a straight line (<math>m</math>), then the maximum number of independent variables his model can support is 4, because <math>\frac{\log{1000}}{\log{5}}=4.29</math>. ==Other methods== Although the parameters of a regression model are usually estimated using the method of least squares, other methods which have been used include: * [[Bayesian method]]s, e.g. [[Bayesian linear regression]] * [[Least absolute deviations]], which is more robust in the presence of outliers, leading to [[quantile regression]] * [[Nonparametric regression]], requires a large number of observations and is computationally intensive * [[Distance metric learning]], which is learned by the search of a meaningful distance metric in a given input space.<ref>{{ cite journal| url = http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangyz/caip09_Long.pdf | title = Human age estimation by metric learning for regression problems | author = YangJing Long | journal= Proc.
