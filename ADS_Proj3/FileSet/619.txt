about the structure of the objects. In the case of groups, the morphisms are the [[group homomorphism]]s. A group homomorphism between two groups "preserves the group structure" in a precise sense – it is a "process" taking one group to another, in a way that carries along information about the structure of the first group into the second group. The study of group homomorphisms then provides a tool for studying general properties of groups and consequences of the group axioms. A similar type of investigation occurs in many mathematical theories, such as the study of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] maps (morphisms) between [[topological space]]s in [[topology]] (the associated category is called '''Top'''), and the study of [[smooth function]]s (morphisms) in [[manifold theory]]. If one axiomatizes [[Finitary relation|relations]] instead of [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s, one obtains the theory of [[Allegory (category theory)|allegories]]. === Functors === {{Main|Functor}} Abstracting again, a category is ''itself'' a type of mathematical structure, so we can look for "processes" which preserve this structure in some sense; such a process is called a [[functor]]. A functor associates to every object of one category an object of another category, and to every morphism in the first category a morphism in the second. In fact, what we have done is define a category ''of categories and functors'' – the objects are categories, and the morphisms (between categories) are functors. By studying categories and functors, we are not just studying a class of mathematical structures and the morphisms between them; we are studying the ''relationships between various classes of mathematical structures''. This is a fundamental idea, which first surfaced in [[algebraic topology]]. Difficult ''topological'' questions can be translated into ''algebraic'' questions which are often easier to solve. Basic constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]] or [http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/FundamentalGroupoidFunctor.html fundamental groupoid] of a [[topological space]], can be expressed as [http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/FundamentalGroupoidFunctor.html fundamental functors] to the category of [[groupoid]]s in this way, and the concept is pervasive in algebra and its applications. === Natural transformation === {{Main|Natural transformation}} Abstracting yet again, constructions are often "naturally related" – a vague notion, at first sight. This leads to the clarifying concept of [[natural transformation]], a way to "map" one functor to another. Many important constructions in mathematics can be studied in this context. "Naturality" is a principle, like [[general covariance]] in physics, that cuts deeper than is initially apparent. ==Historical notes== In 1942–45, [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced categories, functors, and natural transformations as part of their work in topology, especially [[algebraic topology]]. Their work was an important part of the transition from intuitive and geometric [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[axiom]]atic [[homology theory]]. Eilenberg and Mac Lane later wrote that their goal was to understand natural transformations; in order to do that, functors had to be defined, which required categories. [[Stanisław Ulam]], and some writing on his behalf, have claimed that related ideas were current in the late 1930s in Poland. Eilenberg was Polish, and studied mathematics in Poland in the 1930s. Category theory is also, in some sense, a continuation of the work of [[Emmy Noether]] (one of Mac Lane's teachers) in formalizing abstract processes; Noether realized that in order to understand a type of mathematical structure, one needs to understand the processes preserving that structure. In order to achieve this understanding, Eilenberg and Mac Lane proposed an axiomatic formalization of the relation between structures and the processes preserving them. The subsequent development of category theory was powered first by the computational needs of [[homological algebra]], and later by the axiomatic needs of [[algebraic geometry]], the field most resistant to being grounded in either [[axiomatic set theory]] or the [[Russell-Whitehead]] view of united foundations. General category theory, an extension of [[universal algebra]] having many new features allowing for [[semantic]] flexibility and [[higher-order logic]], came later; it is now applied throughout mathematics. Certain categories called [[topos|topoi]] (singular ''topos'') can even serve as an alternative to [[axiomatic set theory]] as a foundation of mathematics. These foundational applications of category theory have been worked out in fair detail as a basis for, and justification of, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]. More recent efforts to introduce undergraduates to categories as a foundation for mathematics include [[William Lawvere|Lawvere]] and Rosebrugh (2003) and Lawvere and Schanuel (1997). [[Categorical logic]] is now a well-defined field based on [[type theory]] for [[intuitionistic logic]]s, with applications in [[functional programming]] and [[domain theory]], where a [[cartesian closed category]] is taken as a non-syntactic description of a [[lambda calculus]]. At the very least, category theoretic language clarifies what exactly these related areas have in common (in some [[Wiktionary:abstract|abstract]] sense). ==Categories, objects, and morphisms== {{Main|Category (mathematics)|Morphism}} A ''category'' ''C'' consists of the following three mathematical entities: * A [[Class (set theory)|class]] ob(''C''), whose elements are called ''objects''; * A class hom(''C''), whose elements are called [[morphism]]s or [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] or ''arrows''. Each morphism ''f'' has a unique ''source object a'' and ''target object b''. We write ''f'': ''a'' → ''b'', and we say "''f'' is a morphism from ''a'' to ''b''". We write hom(''a'', ''b'') (or Hom(''a'', ''b''), or hom<sub>''C''</sub>(''a'', ''b''), or Mor(''a'', ''b''), or ''C''(''a'', ''b'')) to denote the ''hom-class'' of all morphisms from ''a'' to ''b''. * A [[binary operation]] <math>\circ</math>, called ''composition of morphisms'', such that for any three objects ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', we have hom(''a'', ''b'') &times; hom(''b'', ''c'') → hom(''a'', ''c''). The composition of ''f'': ''a'' → ''b'' and ''g'': ''b'' → ''c'' is written as <math>g\circ f</math> or ''gf'' <ref>Some authors compose in the opposite order, writing ''fg'' or <math>f\circ g</math> for <math>g\circ f</math>. Computer scientists using category theory very commonly write ''f;g'' for <math>g\circ f</math></ref>, governed by two axioms: :* [[Associativity]]: If ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'', ''g'' : ''b'' → ''c'' and ''h'' : ''c'' → ''d'' then <math>h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f</math>, and :* [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]: For every object ''x'', there exists a morphism 1<sub>''x''</sub> : ''x'' → ''x'' called the ''[[identity morphism]] for x'', such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'', we have <math>{\rm 1}_b\circ f=f=f\circ{\rm 1}_a</math>. From these axioms,
