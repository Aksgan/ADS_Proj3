linear combinations of the periods, and he determines the coefficients. He sets, for example, <math>(\mathfrak{R}\mathfrak{R})</math> equal to the number of elements of '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' which are in <math>\mathfrak{R}</math> and which, after being increased by one, are also in <math>\mathfrak{R}</math>. He proves that this number and related ones are the coefficients of the products of the periods. To see the relation of these sets to the Weil conjectures, notice that if &alpha; and {{nowrap|&alpha; + 1}} are both in <math>\mathfrak{R}</math>, then there exist ''x'' and ''y'' in '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' such that {{nowrap begin}}''x''<sup>3</sup> = &alpha;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}''y''<sup>3</sup> = &alpha; + 1{{nowrap end}}; consequently, {{nowrap begin}}''x''<sup>3</sup> + 1 = ''y''<sup>3</sup>{{nowrap end}}. Therefore <math>(\mathfrak{R}\mathfrak{R})</math> is the number of solutions to {{nowrap begin}}''x''<sup>3</sup> + 1 = ''y''<sup>3</sup>{{nowrap end}} in the finite field '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''. The other coefficients have similar interpretations. Gauss's determination of the coefficients of the products of the periods therefore counts the number of points on these [[elliptic curve]]s, and as a byproduct he proves the analog of the Riemann hypothesis. The Weil conjectures in the special case of [[algebraic curve]]s were conjectured by {{harvtxt|Artin|1924}}. The case of curves over finite fields was proved by Weil, finishing the project started by [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves]] over finite fields. Their interest was obvious enough from within [[number theory]]: they implied upper bounds for [[exponential sum]]s, a basic concern in [[analytic number theory]].{{harv|Moreno|2001}} What was really eye-catching, from the point of view of other mathematical areas, was the proposed connection with [[algebraic topology]]. Given that finite fields are ''discrete'' in nature, and topology speaks only about the ''continuous'', the detailed formulation of Weil (based on working out some examples) was striking and novel. It suggested that geometry over finite fields should fit into well-known patterns relating to [[Betti number]]s, the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] and so on. The analogy with topology suggested that a new homological theory be set up applying within [[algebraic geometry]]. This took two decades (it was a central aim of the work and school of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]) building up on initial suggestions from [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]. The rationality part of the conjectures was proved first by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Bernard Dwork|first=Bernard |last=Dwork|year=1960}}, using [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] methods. {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1965}} and his collaborators established the rationality conjecture, the functional equation and the link to Betti numbers by using the properties of [[étale cohomology]], a new cohomology theory developed by Grothendieck and Artin for attacking the Weil conjectures, as outlined in {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1960}}. Of the four conjectures the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was the hardest to prove. Motivated by the proof of {{harvtxt|Serre|1960}} of an analogue of the Weil conjectures for [[Kähler manifold]]s, Grothendieck envisioned a proof based on his [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]] {{harv|Kleiman|1968}}. However, the standard conjectures remain open (except for the hard Lefschetz theorem, which was proved by Deligne by extending his work on the Weil conjectures), and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Pierre Deligne|last=Deligne|year=1974}}, using the étale cohomology theory but circumventing the use of standard conjectures by an ingenious argument. {{harvtxt|Deligne|1980}} found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf. ==Statement of the Weil conjectures== Suppose that ''X'' is a [[non-singular]] ''n''-dimensional [[projective algebraic variety]] over the field '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> with ''q'' elements. The '''zeta function''' ζ(''X'', ''s'') of ''X'' is by definition :<math>\zeta(X, s) = \exp\left(\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{N_m}{m} (q^{-s})^m\right)</math> where ''N''<sub>''m''</sub> is the number of points of ''X'' defined over the degree ''m'' extension '''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''m''</sup></sub> of '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>. The Weil conjectures state: #(Rationality) ζ(''X'', ''s'') is a ''[[rational function]]'' of {{nowrap begin}}''T'' = ''q''<sup>&minus;s</sup>{{nowrap end}}. More precisely, &zeta;(''X'', ''s'') can be written as a finite alternating product <dl><dd><math>\textstyle\prod_{i=0}^{2n} P_i(q^{-s})^{(-1)^{i+1}} = \frac{P_1(T)\dotsb P_{2n-1}(T)}{P_0(T)\dotsb P_{2n}(T)},</math></dl> where each ''P''<sub>''i''</sub>(''T'') is an integral polynomial. Furthermore, {{nowrap begin}}''P''<sub>0</sub>(''T'') = 1 &minus; T{{nowrap end}}, {{nowrap begin}}''P''<sub>2''n''</sub>(''T'') = 1 &minus; ''q''<sup>''n''</sup>''T''{{nowrap end}}, and for {{nowrap|1 &le; i &le; 2n &minus; 1}}, ''P''<sub>''i''</sub>(''T'') factors over '''C''' as <math>\textstyle\prod_j (1 - \alpha_{ij}T)</math> for some numbers &alpha;<sub>''ij''</sub>. #(Functional equation and Poincaré duality) The zeta function satisfies <dl><dd><math>\zeta(X,n-s)=\plusmn q^{\frac{nE}{2}-Es}\zeta(X,s)</math></dl> or equivalently <dl><dd><math>\zeta(X,q^{-n}T)=\plusmn q^{\frac{nE}{2}}T^E\zeta(X,T)</math></dl> where ''E'' is the [[Euler characteristic]] of ''X''. In particular, for each ''i'', the numbers α<sub>2''n''-''i'',1</sub>, α<sub>2''n''-''i'',2</sub>, &hellip; equal the numbers ''q''<sup>''n''</sup>/α<sub>''i'',1</sub>, ''q''<sup>''n''</sup>/α<sub>''i'',2</sub>, … in some order. #(Riemann hypothesis) |α<sub>''i,j''</sub>| = ''q''<sup>''i''/2</sup> for all {{nowrap|1 &le; ''i'' &le; 2''n'' &minus; 1}} and all ''j''. This implies that all zeros of ''P''<sub>''k''</sub>(''T'') lie on the "critical line" of complex numbers ''s'' with real part ''k''/2. #(Comparison) If ''X'' is a (good) "[[reduction mod p|reduction mod ''p'']]" of a [[non-singular]] projective variety ''Y'' defined over a number field embedded in the field of complex numbers, then the degree of ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> is the ''i''<sup>th</sup> [[Betti number]] of the space of complex points of ''Y''. ==Examples== ===The projective line=== The simplest example (other than a point) is to take ''X'' to be the projective line. The number of points of ''X'' over a field with ''q''<sup>''m''</sup> elements is just ''N''<sub>''m''</sub> = ''q''<sup>''m''</sup> + 1 (where the "+ 1" comes from the "[[point at infinity]]"). The zeta function is just :1/(1 &minus; ''q''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>)(1 &minus; ''q''<sup>1&minus;''s''</sup>). It is easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. For example, the corresponding complex variety is the [[Riemann sphere]] and its initial Betti numbers are 1, 0, 1. ===Projective space=== It is not much harder to do ''n'' dimensional projective space. The number of points of ''X'' over a field with ''q''<sup>''m''</sup> elements is just ''N''<sub>''m''</sub> = 1 + ''q''<sup>''m''</sup> + ''q''<sup>2''m''</sup> + ... + ''q''<sup>''nm''</sup>. The zeta function is just :1/(1 &minus; ''q''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>)(1 &minus; ''q''<sup>1&minus;''s''</sup>)(1 &minus; ''q''<sup>2&minus;''s''</sup>) ... (1 &minus; ''q''<sup>''n''&minus;''s''</sup>). It is again easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. ([[Complex projective space]] gives the relevant Betti numbers, which nearly determine the answer.) The reason why the projective line and projective space were so easy is that they can be written as disjoint unions of a finite number of copies of affine spaces, which makes the number of points on them particularly easy to calculate. It is also easy to prove
