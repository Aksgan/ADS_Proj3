by most other data description formalisms: DLs do not make the [[Unique Name Assumption]] (UNA) or the [[Closed World Assumption]] (CWA). Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent. Not having CWA, or rather having the [[Open World Assumption]] (OWA) means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact. == Formal Description == Like [[first order logic]] (FOL), a [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]] defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a Description Logic (DL), and [[semantics]] determine meaning. Unlike FOL, a DL may have several well known syntactic variants <ref name="HS"/>. === Syntax === The syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition, in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated. Some constructors are related to logical constructors in [[first-order logic]] (FOL) such as ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' or ''[[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[union (set theory)|union]]'' or ''[[disjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[negation]]'' or ''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]'' of concepts, ''[[Universal quantifier|universal restriction]]'' and ''[[Existential quantifier|existential restriction]]''. Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example, inverse, [[transitive relation|transitivity]] and functionality. ==== Notation ==== Let C and D be concepts, a and b be individuals, and R be a role. {| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable sortable" |+ Conventional Notation |- !

The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.<ref name="DLHB"/> Let <math>N_C</math>, <math>N_R</math> and <math>N_O</math> be (respectively) [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of ''concept names'' (also known as an ''atomic concepts''), ''role names'' and ''individual names'' (also known as ''individuals'' or ''objects''). Then the ordered triple (<math>N_C</math>, <math>N_R</math>, <math>N_O</math> ) is the ''signature''. ===== Concepts ===== The set of <math>\mathcal{ALC}</math> ''concepts'' is the smallest set such that: * The following are ''concepts'': ** <math>\top</math> (''top'' is a ''concept'') ** <math>\bot</math> (''bottom'' is a ''concept'') ** Every <math>A \in N_C</math> (all ''atomic concepts'' are ''concepts'') * If <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> are ''concepts'' and <math>R \in N_R</math> then the following are ''concepts'': ** <math>C\sqcap D</math> (the intersection of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'') ** <math>C\sqcup D</math> (the union of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'') ** <math>\neg C</math> (the complement of a ''concept'' is a ''concept'') ** <math>\forall R.C</math> (the universal restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'') ** <math>\exists R.C</math> (the existential restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'') ===== Terminological Axioms ===== A ''general concept inclusion'' (GCI) has the form <math>C \sqsubseteq D</math> where <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> are ''concepts''. Write <math>C \dot = D</math> when <math>C \sqsubseteq D</math> and <math>D \sqsubseteq C</math>. A ''TBox'' is any finite set of GCIs. ===== Assertional Axioms ===== * A ''concept assertion'' is a statement of the form <math>a : C</math> where <math>a \in N_O</math> and C is a ''concept''. * A ''role assertion'' is a statement of the form <math>(a, b) : R</math> where <math>a, b \in N_O</math> and R is a ''role''. An ''ABox'' is a finite set of assertional axioms. ===== Knowledge Base ===== A ''knowledge base'' (KB) is an ordered pair <math>(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{A})</math> for ''TBox'' <math>\mathcal{T}</math> and ''ABox'' <math>\mathcal{A}</math>. === Semantics === The [[semantics]] of description logics is defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of pairs of individuals. Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain. The semantics of non atomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles. This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax. ==== The Description Logic ALC ==== The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.<ref name="DLHB"/> A ''terminological interpretation'' <math>\mathcal{I}=(\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}, \cdot^{\mathcal{I}})</math> over a ''signature'' <math>(N_C,N_R,N_O)</math> consists of * a non-empty set <math>\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}</math> called the [[domain of discourse|''domain'']] * a ''interpretation function'' <math>\cdot^{\mathcal{I}}</math> that maps: ** every ''individual'' <math>a</math> to an element <math>a^{\mathcal{I}} \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}</math> ** every ''concept'' to a subset of <math>\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}</math> ** every ''role name'' to a subset of <math>\Delta^{\mathcal{I}} \times \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}</math> such that * <math>\top^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}</math> * <math>\bot^{\mathcal{I}} = \emptyset</math> * <math>(C \sqcup D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cup D^{\mathcal{I}}</math> ''([[union (set theory)|union]] means [[disjunction]])'' * <math>(C \sqcap D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cap D^{\mathcal{I}}</math> ''([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] means [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]])'' * <math>(\neg C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} \setminus C^{\mathcal{I}} </math> ''([[complement (set theory)|complement]] means [[negation]])'' * <math>(\forall R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \texttt{for} \; \texttt{every} \; y, (x,y) \in R^{\mathcal{I}} \; \texttt{implies} \; y \in C^{\mathcal{I}} \} </math> * <math>(\exists R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \texttt{there} \; \texttt{exists} \; y, (x,y)
