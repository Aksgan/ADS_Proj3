Numbers]}} At the time, computers were typically built up from a series of "modules", each module containing the electronics needed to perform a single function. A complex circuit like an [[adder (electronics)|adder]] would generally require several modules working in concert. The modules were typically built on [[printed circuit boards]] of a standardized size, with a connector on one edge that allowed them to be plugged into the power and signaling lines of the machine, and were then wired to other modules using [[twisted pair]] or [[coaxial cable]]. Since each module was relatively custom, modules were assembled and soldered by hand or with limited automation. As a result, they suffered major reliability problems. Even a single bad component or solder joint could render the entire module inoperative. Even with properly working modules, the mass of wiring connecting them together was another source of construction and reliability problems. As computers grew in complexity, and the number of modules increased, the complexity of making a machine actually work grew more and more difficult. This was the "tyranny of numbers". It was precisely this problem that [[Jack Kilby]] was thinking about while working at [[Texas Instruments]]. Theorizing that germanium could be used to make all common electronic components - resistors, capacitors, etc. - he set about building a single-slab component that combined the functionality of an entire module. Although successful in this goal, it was [[Robert Noyce]]'s silicon version and the associated fabrication techniques that make the [[integrated circuit]] (IC) truly practical. Unlike modules, ICs were built using [[photoetching]] techniques on an [[assembly line]], greatly reducing their cost. Although any given IC might have the same chance of working or not working as a module, they cost so little that if they didn't work you simply threw it away and tried another. In fact, early IC assembly lines had failure rates around 90% or greater, which kept their prices high. The [[U.S Air Force]] and [[NASA]] were major purchasers of early ICs, where their small size and light weight overcame any cost issues. ICs from the early 1960s were not complex enough for general computer use, but as the complexity increased through the 1960s, practically all computers switched to IC-based designs. The result was what are today referred to as the [[history of computing hardware|third-generation computers]], which became commonplace during the early 1970s. The progeny of the integrated circuit, the [[microprocessor]], eventually superseded the use of individual ICs as well, placing the entire collection of modules onto one chip. [[Seymour Cray]] was particularly well known for making complex designs work in spite of the tyranny of numbers. His attention to detail and ability to fund several attempts at a working design if need be meant that pure engineering effort could overcome the problems they faced. Yet even Cray eventually succumbed to the problem during the [[CDC 8600]] project, which eventually led to him leaving [[Control Data]]. ==References== * [http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/kilbyctr/jackbuilt.shtml "The Chip that Jack Built"], [[Texas Instruments]] [[Category:Computer engineering]] [[Category:Early computers|*Tyranny of numbers]] [[fr:Tyrannie des nombres]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38537</id> <title>U-Prove</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = U-Prove | logo = <!-- [[File: ]] --> | screenshot = <!-- [[File: ]] --> | caption = | collapsible = | author = Credentica | developer = [[Microsoft]] | released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | discontinued = | latest release version = | latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | latest preview version = | latest preview date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | frequently updated = | programming language = | operating system = | platform = | size = | language = | status = | genre = [[Identity management]] | license = [[BSD licenses|BSD]] | website = http://www.credentica.com/the_mit_pressbook.html }} '''U-Prove''' is an [[identity management]] framework originally developed by [[Credentica]], which was later acquired by [[Microsoft]].<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/03/microsoft-open-sources-clever-u-prove-identity-framework.ars Microsoft open-sources clever U-Prove identity framework]</ref> It aims to offer greater [[privacy]] compared to existing public-key identity management frameworks, and allows for implementation within [[smart card]]s.
