While Seropian did design and marketing, Jones finished the programming.

"The PC market was really cutthroat, but the Mac market was all friendly and lame. So it was easier to compete," Jones said.<ref name="bungie-primordial soup gnop"/> After ''Minotaur'', Bungie began work on a 3D graphics version of the game, but realized that the game's format was not suited to a 3D environment. Instead, Jones and Seropian wrote a brand-new story for what became ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Since Bungie had no money and Jones was the only one with the available time, he single-handedly coded the game on a [[Mac IIfx]], passing art chores to his friend Colin Brent.<ref name="img-93 interview"/><ref name="bungie-primordial soup pathways">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=|url=http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=pathways|title=Bungie History: Primordial Soup—Pathways!|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref> ''Pathways'' was successful enough that Bungie moved from a one-bedroom apartment to an actual office.<ref name="bungie-primordial soup pathways"/> Bungie's next project started as an update of ''Pathways'' but evolved into a science fiction shooter game, [[Marathon (video game)|''Marathon'']].
