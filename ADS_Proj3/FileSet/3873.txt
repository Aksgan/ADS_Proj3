series were the V6 and V8, with 32MB and 128MB of RAM respectively. The V10 and V12 had double the geometry performance of the older V6/V8, but were otherwise similar. The V6 and V10 can have up to 8MB RAM allocated to textures, while V8 and V12 can have up to 108MB RAM used for textures. The V10 and V12 boards used in Fuel, Tezro and Onyx 3000 computers use a different XIO connector than the cards used in Octane2 workstations. The VPro graphics subsystem consists of an SGI proprietary chip set and associated software. The chip set consists of the '''buzz''' [[ASIC]], the '''pixel blaster and jammer''' (PB&J) ASIC, and associated [[SDRAM]]. The buzz ASIC is a single-chip graphics pipeline. It operates at 251 MHz and contains on-chip SRAM. The buzz ASIC has three interfaces: * Host (16-bit, 400-MHz peer-to-peer XIO link) * SDRAM (The SDRAM is 32 MB (V6 or V10) or 128 MB (V8 or V12); the memory bus operates at half the speed of the buzz ASIC.) * PB&J ASIC All VPro boards support the [[OpenGL ARB]] imaging extensions, allowing for hardware acceleration of numerous imaging operations at real-time rates. ==VPro Series== {| border="1" cellpadding="2" |'''Model''' |'''Colour depth''' |'''Memory''' |'''Texture memory (maximum)''' |'''Geometry engine speed''' |- |V6 |48-bit RGBA |32 MB |8 MB |Original |- |V8 |48-bit RGBA |128 MB |104 MB |Original |- |V10 |48-bit RGBA |32 MB |8 MB |2× original |- |V12 |48-bit RGBA |128 MB |104 MB |2× original |- |} == External links == * [http://web.archive.org/web/20080317120712/http://www.sgi.com/products/remarketed/octane2/graphics.html SGI page about Octane2 graphics] (wayback machine link, original page is 404).

SHA stands for '''[[Secure Hash Algorithm]]'''. The three SHA [[algorithm]]s are structured differently and are distinguished as ''SHA-0'', ''SHA-1'', and ''[[SHA-2]]''. SHA-1 is very similar to SHA-0, but corrects an error in the original SHA hash specification that led to significant weaknesses. The SHA-0 algorithm was not adopted by many applications. SHA-2 on the other hand significantly differs from the SHA-1 hash function. SHA-1 is the most widely used of the existing SHA hash functions, and is employed in several widely-used security applications and protocols. In 2005, security flaws were identified in SHA-1, namely that a mathematical weakness might exist, indicating that a stronger hash function would be desirable.<ref>[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html Schneier on Security: Cryptanalysis of SHA-1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Although no successful attacks have yet been reported on the SHA-2 variants, they are algorithmically similar to SHA-1 and so efforts are underway to develop improved alternatives.<ref>[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/11/nist_hash_works_4.html Schneier on Security: NIST Hash Workshop Liveblogging (5)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Hash-cracked--/features/75686/2 Hash cracked – heise Security<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A new hash standard, SHA-3, is currently under development — an ongoing [[NIST hash function competition]] is scheduled to end with the selection of a winning function in 2012. ==The SHA-1 hash function== [[File:SHA-1.svg|thumbnail|right|300px|One iteration within the SHA-1 compression function:<br> A, B, C, D and E are 32-bit [[Word (computing)|words]] of the state;<br> ''F'' is a nonlinear function that varies;<br> [[File:lll.png|left shift]]<sub>''n''</sub> denotes a left bit rotation by ''n'' places;<br> ''n'' varies for each operation;<br> W<sub>t</sub> is the expanded message word of round t;<br> K<sub>t</sub> is the round constant of round t;<br> [[Image:Boxplus.png|Addition]] denotes addition modulo 2<sup>32</sup>.]] SHA-1 produces a 160-bit message digest based on principles similar to those used by [[Ron Rivest|Ronald L. Rivest]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in the design of the [[MD4]] and [[MD5]] message digest algorithms, but has a more conservative design. The original specification of the algorithm was published in 1993 as the ''Secure Hash Standard'', [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] PUB 180, by US government standards agency [[NIST]] (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This version is now often referred to as ''SHA-0''. It was withdrawn by [[NSA]] shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS PUB 180-1 and commonly referred to as ''SHA-1''. SHA-1 differs from SHA-0 only by a single bitwise rotation in the message schedule of its [[One-way compression function|compression function]]; this was done, according to NSA, to correct a flaw in the original algorithm which reduced its cryptographic security. However, NSA did not provide any further explanation or identify the flaw that was corrected. Weaknesses have subsequently been reported in both SHA-0 and SHA-1. SHA-1 appears to provide greater resistance to attacks, supporting the NSA’s assertion that the change increased the security. {{-}} ==Comparison of SHA functions== In the table below, ''internal state'' means the “internal hash sum” after each compression of a data block. {{See|Merkle–Damgård construction}} {| border=1 class="wikitable" ! colspan="2" | Algorithm and variant !Output size<br />(bits) !Internal state<br />size (bits) !Block size<br />(bits) !Max message<br />size (bits) !Word size<br />(bits) !Rounds !Operations ![[Hash collision|Collisions]]<br />found? |- align="center" | colspan="2" | '''SHA-0''' ||rowspan=2| 160 ||rowspan=2| 160 ||rowspan=2| 512 ||rowspan=2| 2<sup>64</sup> − 1 ||rowspan=2| 32 ||rowspan=2| 80 ||rowspan=2| +,and,or,xor,rot || Yes |- align="center" | colspan="2" | '''SHA-1''' || No <ref>[http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/469.pdf Classification and Generation of Disturbance Vectors for Collision Attacks against SHA-1]</ref> |- align="center" | rowspan="2" | '''SHA-2''' || ''SHA-256/224'' || 256/224 || 256 || 512 || 2<sup>64</sup> − 1 || 32 ||
