After a short spell at ''[[Pilote]]'', he began contributing to the monthly magazine ''[[Fluide Glacial]]'' in 1977, and became one of its authors. Later, his work also appeared in ''[[Le Petit Psikopat Illustré]]'' (ancestor of current ''[[Psikopat]]'') and ''[[Rigolo]]''. Apart from his work with comic strips, Daniel Goossens is a lecturer and researcher in artificial intelligence at the [[University of Paris VIII]]. Goossens was awarded the [[Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême]] in 1997. ==Style== Goossens's comics are built on a clash between semi-realistic art and surreal content. He relishes in regurgitating clichéd situations from literature, film and television, and introducing odd twists. (His classic ''Route vers l'enfer'' book is a war film pastiche starring Father Christmas). Particular attention is paid to dialogues, which often drag on past all logic, and include much stuttering, mumbling and other noises rendered phonetically. Most of his comic books are collections of short stories, with a loose common thread. Like his mentor [[Gotlib]], Goossens has also often used a mock-encyclopedic tone. Some of his works contain astonishing and disturbing scenes, such as a gang of children stoning Father Christmas, or a woman bringing her baby's skeleton to the doctor. ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Goossens, Daniel | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 1954 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Goossens, Daniel}} [[Category:1954 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:People from Salon-de-Provence]] [[Category:French cartoonists]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]] [[de:Daniel Goossens]] [[fr:Daniel Goossens]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9207</id> <title>Daniel Robbins</title> <text>{{Infobox person | name = Daniel Robbins | honorific_suffix = | image = | image_size = | alt = | caption = | birth_date = <!-- {{Birth date|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | birth_place = [[Montreal]], {{flag|Quebec}} | residence = [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] | nationality = {{flag|United States}} | other_names = | education = [[Computer science]] | alma_mater = [[University of New Mexico]] | occupation = | years_active = | employer = [[OPNET]] | organization = [[Funtoo Technologies]] | known_for = [[Free Software]], [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|Hacker]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], [[Funtoo]] | notable_works = | home_town = | awards = | module = | module2 = | module3 = | module4 = | module5 = | module6 = | website = {{URL|www.funtoo.org}} | footnotes = | box_width = }} '''Daniel Robbins''' (US citizen, born in Montreal, Quebec<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.funtoo-quebec.org/node/19 Funtoo-Quebec.org source]</ref>) is a [[computer programmer]] and consultant best known as the founder and former chief architect of the [[Gentoo Linux]] project.
