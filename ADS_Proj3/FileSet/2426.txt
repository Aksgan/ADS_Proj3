In late 2008, Kiwibox signed contracts with Universal Music Group to distribute video content to its users.<ref>[http://www.adotas.com/2008/10/umg-to-distribute-music-videos-on-kiwibox/ UMG To Distribute Music Videos on Kiwibox]</ref> Early in 2009, with over 500 original self-produced videos, Kiwibox was accepted into the partnership program with [[youtube|YouTube, LLC]].<ref>[http://www.901am.com/2009/kiwibox-joins-youtube-partner-program.html Kiwibox Accepted Into YouTube Partner Program]</ref> Kiwibox crossed 2 million registered members.<ref name="reuters.com"/> The 4KIWI [[SMS]] platform launched enabeling users to get [[SMS]] updates from news to friend alerts. === 2010 === During the beginning months of 2010, Kiwibox released their full functioning Android application allowing users to easily explore, connect, and party via their cellular phones. The revamped site is now a community for college students and young professionals, to connect with friends on the net and meet new people while having a fulfilling online experience. Kiwibox is a platform for them to show off their skills and interests, whether it is writing, photography, event promotion and planning, or general technical tasks. Along with the social network, the online magazine continues to thrive as well as the new Nightlife/Events section. == See also == *[[List of social networking websites]] == References == <references/> == External links == *[http://www.kiwibox.com/ Official website] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 1999]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20725</id> <title>Klaus Samelson</title> <text>'''Klaus Samelson''' (December 21, 1918<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/p1rp2252u6192485/ Necrology], [http://www.springerlink.com/ Springer].</ref> – May 25, 1980) was a [[Germany|German]] mathematician, physicist, and computer pioneer in the area of [[Compiler|programming language translation]] and [[Stack (data structure)|push-pop stack]] algorithms for sequential formula translation on computers. == Early life == He was born in [[Strasbourg]], [[Alsace]], and he lived in [[Breslau]] in his early childhood years. Due to political circumstances, he waited until 1946 to study Mathematics and Physics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in [[Munich]]. == Career == After graduating, he worked shortly as a high school teacher before he returned to university. He completed his doctorate degree in Physics with [[Friedrich Bopp|Fritz Bopp]] with a dissertation on a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] problem posed by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] related to [[Homopolar generator|Unipolar Induction]].<ref>Samelson, Klaus: ''Bemerkungen zur Theorie der Unipolarinduktion und verwandter Effekte'' (Remarks on the Theory of Unipolar Induction and Related Effects), Ph.D. thesis, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München, 1951, Advisor: Fritz Bopp.</ref> Dr Samelson became interested in [[Numerical analysis|Numerical Analysis]], and when Hans Piloty, an electrical engineer, and Robert Sauer, a professor of Mathematics, began working together, he joined and got involved in early computers as a research associate in the Mathematical Institute of the Technical University Munich. This changed his scientific career. His first publications came from Sauer's interests dealing with supersonic flow and precision problems of digital computations for numerical calculations of [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|Eigenvalues]]. Soon after, Samelson's strong influence began on the development of Computer Science and Informatics as a new scientific discipline. With [[Friedrich L. Bauer]], who also had Fritz Bopp as his Ph.D. advisor, he studied the structure of programming languages in order to develop efficient algorithms for their translation and implementation. This research led to bracketed structures and it became clear to Samelson that this principle should govern the translation of programming languages and the run-time system with stack models and block structure. It was a fundamental breakthrough in how computer systems are modeled and designed. Piloty, Bauer and Samelson had also worked on the design of [[PERM, computer|PERM]], a computer based partially on the [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] concept. By 1955, the PERM was completed and they continued work that Bauer had begun in 1951 on concepts in automatic programming. Samelson played a key role in the design of [[ALGOL]] 58 and ALGOL 60. In 1958, he accepted a chair for Mathematics at the [[University of Mainz]], and since 1963 he held a chair at the Technical University Munich where he and F.L. Bauer, began to develop a university curriculum for Informatics and Computer Science. He was involved with international standards in programming and informatics through [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]]. He became an editor of the journal Acta Informatica when it began in 1971. == Selected publications
