similar to SP networks, there are some differences that make either this or that more applicable in certain situations. For a given amount of [[confusion and diffusion]], an SP network has more "inherent parallelism"<ref> [http://www.ddj.com/184410756 "Principles and Performance of Cryptographic Algorithms"] by Bart Preneel, Vincent Rijmen, and Antoon Bosselaers. </ref> and so &mdash; given a CPU with a large number of [[execution unit]]s &mdash; can be computed faster than a Feistel network. <ref> [http://www.schneier.com/skein1.1.pdf "The Skein Hash Function Family"] 2008 by Niels Ferguson, Stefan Lucks, Bruce Schneier, Doug Whiting, Mihir Bellare, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jon Callas, Jesse Walker page 40. </ref> CPUs with few execution units &mdash; such as most [[smart card]]s &mdash; cannot take advantage of this inherent parallelism. ==References== * Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell, ''Introduction to Modern Cryptography''.

To perform '''''a − b''''' using this method, '''''b''''', the [[subtrahend]], is written below '''''a''''', the [[minuend]], such that the digits of the two numbers are aligned in columns. When a digit of the minuend is smaller than the corresponding digit of the subtrahend below it, the procedure calls for '''''borrowing''''' one power of '''10'''.<ref> This brief discussion of the ''borrowing method'' refers to the decimal number system and decimal place values. The basic procedures described here can be applied to other situations. Only the boundary values and the borrowed magnitudes depend on the number system and the place values. For example, while performing time subtraction, if borrowing is necessary for the '''tens''' digit of the seconds, the borrowed '''minute''' adds '''60''' seconds to the number of seconds specified by the current digit, not '''10'''.</ref> from the digit of the [[minuend]] that is immediately to the left of the current digit.<ref> Also this discussion of the ''borrowing method'' does not address more complex situations such as when the “lending” digit is '''0''' (zero) and, therefore, nothing can be borrowed from it.</ref> Then the value of the "lending" digit is reduced by '''1'''. (More formally this is the ''decomposition algorithm'' because the "borrowed" power of '''10''' does not have to be and is never returned.<ref> Subtraction in the United States: An Historical Perspective, Susan Ross, Mary Pratt-Cotter, ''The Mathematics Educator'', Vol. 8, No. 1 (original publication) and Vol. 10, No. 1 (reprint.) http://math.coe.uga.edu/TME/Issues/v10n2/5ross.pdf</ref>) Anyone who subtracts using the borrowing method must do so from right to left, starting at the lowest-value digit and proceeding toward the highest-value digit. It is also necessary to remember to reduce the value of each “lending” digit by 1 before subtracting the corresponding digit of the subtrahend from it. Because of these requirements, learning subtraction with borrowing is difficult for some students.<ref>[http://www.mathventures.com/mathed/Arithmetic/SubtractionWithoutBorrowingLite.htm Subtraction Without Borrowing] on [http://www.mathventures.com/ MathVentures]</ref> An alternative to the borrowing method is '''subtraction without borrowing'''. There are several methods for subtraction without borrowing. However most of them employ other computational methods that are as complex as the methods they aim to replace or they introduce mathematical concepts for which the students who learn subtraction with borrowing are not ready. Among these are methods that use negative numbers and some variations of the [[method of complements]]. '''Note.''' The subtraction methods mentioned here assume that the minuend is larger than the subtrahend. If the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the roles of the numbers are reversed and any subtraction method can be used followed by setting the result to be negative. If the two numbers are equal the result is zero and no method is needed. == Algorithm == The basic algorithm is: # Change the [[minuend]]: ## Subtract '''1''' from the rightmost consecutive digit that is larger than or equal to the corresponding digit of the [[subtrahend]]; ## Change each digit to the right of the digit you reduced by '''1''' (Step #1.1) to '''9''' – this is the new minuend; # Add '''1''' to the number whose digits you changed to '''9''''s – this sum is the difference between the original minuend and the new one; # Carry out the subtraction using the new minuend; # Add the difference you got in Step #2 to the result of Step #3. This is the final answer. == Descriptive example == {{Inappropriate tone|date=April 2008}} As demonstrated by the example below, subtraction without borrowing employs single-digit subtraction in each column of digits and then addition. <!--Formatting issue: I did not find a way to underline the subtrahend and for an indented numbers in monospace font. Therefore, I used a line of dashes (-) or a line of equal signs (=) as needed. --> <tt> ''' 65432''' (minuend) '''- <u>27894</u>''' (subtrahend) </tt> *Change the minuend to '''59999'''. *The difference between the original minuend and this new one is '''5433'''. <blockquote> It is necessary to remember this difference.
