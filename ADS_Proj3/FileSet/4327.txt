His critique on the concept of modern race and culture had political implications in the racial politics of the United States in the 1920s. In his chapter, “The Race Problem in Modern Society,” one can feel Boas’ intellectual effort toward separating the natural from the social sciences and setting up the space for genuine political solutions for race relations. === Structural-Functionalism === [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] developed a structural functionalism approach in anthropology. He believed that concrete reality is "not any sort of entity but a process, the process of social life."<ref>A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society'', Free Press, 1952. 4</ref> Radcliffe-Brown emphasized on learning the social form especially a kinship system of primitive societies. The way in which one can study the pattern of life is by conceptually delineating a relation determined by a kinship or marriage, "and that we can give a general analytical description of them as constituting a system."<ref>A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''. Free Press, 1952, 6</ref> The systems consist of structure which is referred to "some sort of ordered arrangement of parts or components."<ref>A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''. Free Press, 1952, 9</ref> The intervening variable between the processes and structure is a function. The three concepts of process, structure, and function are thus "components of a single theory as a scheme of interpretation of human social systems."<ref>A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''. Free Press, 1952, 12</ref> Most importantly, function "is the part it plays in, the contribution it makes to, the life of the organism as a whole."<ref>A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''. Free Press, 1952, 179</ref> Thus the functionality of each part in the system works together to maintain a harmony or internal consistency. British anthropologist, [[E. R. Leach]], went beyond the instrumentalist argument of Radcliffe-Brown’s structural-functionalism, which approached social norms, kinship, etc. in functionalist terms rather than as social fields, or arenas of contestation. According to Leach, “the nicely ordered ranking of lineage seniority conceals a vicious element of competition.”<ref>E. R. Leach, ''Political Systems of Highland Burma'', 194.</ref> In fact, Leach was sensitive to “the essential difference between the ritual description of structural relations and the anthropologist’s scientific description.”<ref>E. R. Leach, ''Political System of Highland Burma'',</ref> For instance, in his book, Leach argues, “the question that whether a particular community is gumlao, or gumsa, or Shan is not necessarily ascertainable in the realm of empirical facts; it is a question, in part at any rate, of the attitudes and ideas of particular individuals at a particular time.”<ref>E. R. Leach, ''Political System of Highland Burma'', 286</ref> Thus, Leach separated conceptual categories from empirical realities. === Structural Anthropology === Swiss linguist, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], in search of discovering universal laws of language, formulated a general science of linguistic by bifurcating language into langue, abstract system of language, and parole, utterance or speech. The phonemes, fundamental unit of sound, are the basic structure of a language. The linguistic community gives a social dimension to a language. Moreover, linguistic signs are arbitrary and change only comes with time and not by individual will. Drawing on structural linguistics, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] transforms the world into a text and thus subjected social phenomena to linguistic laws as formulated by Saussure. For instance, the “primitive systems” such as kinship, magic, mythologies, and rituals are scrutinized under the similar linguistic dichotomies of abstract normative system (objective) and utterance (subjective). The division did not only split social actions, but it also conditioned them to the categories of abstract systems that are made up of deep structures. For example, Lévi-Strauss suggests, “Kinship phenomena are of the same type as linguistic phenomena.”<ref>Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''Structural Anthropology'', Basic Books, 1974, 34</ref> As Saussure discovered phonemes as the basic structures of language, Lévi-Strauss identified (1) consanguinity, (2) affinity, and (3) descent as the deep structures of kinship. These “microsociological” levels serve “to discover the most general structural laws.”<ref>Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''Structural Anthropology'', Basic Books, 1974, 35</ref> The deep structures acquire meanings only with respect to the system they constitute. “Like phonemes, kinship terms are elements of meaning; like phonemes, they acquire meaning only if they are integrated into systems.”<ref>Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''Structural Anthropology'', Basic Books, 1974, 34</ref> Like the langue and parole distinctions of language, kinship system consists of (1) system of terminology (vocabulary), through which relationships are expressed and (2) system of attitudes (psychological or social) functions for social cohesion. To elaborate the dynamic interdependence between systems of terminology and attitudes, Lévi-Strauss rejected Radcliffe-Brown’s idea that a system of attitudes is merely the manifestation of a system of terminology on the affective level. He turned to the concept of the avunculate as a part of a whole, which comprise of three types of relationship consanguinity, affinity, and descent. Thus, Lévi-Strauss identified complex avuncular relationships, contrary to atomism and simplified labels of avunculate associated with matrilineal descent. Furthermore, he suggested that kinship systems “exist only in human consciousness; it is an arbitrary system of representations, not the spontaneous development of a real situation.”<ref>Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''Structural Anthropology'', Basic Books, 1974, 50</ref> The meaning of an element (avunculate) exists only in relation to a kinship structure. Lévi-Strauss elaborates the meaning and structure point further in his essay titled “The Sorcerer and His Magic.” The sorcerer, patient, and group, according to Lévi-Strauss, comprise a shaman complex, which makes social consensus an underlying pattern for understanding. The work of a sorcerer is to reintegrate divergent expressions or feelings of patients into “patterns present in the group’s culture. The assimilation of such patterns is the only means of objectivizing subjective states, of formulating inexpressible feelings, and of integrating inarticulated experiences into a system.”<ref>Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''Structural Anthropology'', Basic Books, 1974, 166</ref> The three examples that Lévi-Strauss mentions relate to magic, a practice reached as a social consensus, by a group of people including sorcerer and patient. It seems that people make sense of certain activities through beliefs, created by social consensus, and not by the effectiveness of magical practices.
