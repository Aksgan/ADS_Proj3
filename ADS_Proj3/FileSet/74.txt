a machine-readable [[Annotation|semantic description]], applying the [[Semantic technology|semantic technologies]] as shared domain ontologies, formal ontology languages (e.g. [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], [[OWL]], [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]]), [[Semantic Web Services]] and corresponding frameworks as e.g. [[RDF Schema|RDF-S]], [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]], [[OWL-S]], and [[WSMO]] (see also the list of [[#Related_Projects|Related projects]]). Within the Access-eGov, the [[WSMO|WSMO framework]] was selected as a basic implementation platform. ==Access-eGov approach, objectives and solution== The project objectives were defined on organisational and technological levels. Main ''organisational objective'' is to improve [[accessibility]] and [[connectivity]] of governmental services for citizens and businesses. ''Technical objectives'' are focused on the development of the [[software platform]] and tools for integration of various types of governmental services on a semantic basis, including a [[methodology]] for maintenance of the solution by public administrations. A resource WSML [[ontology]] covering basic [[Domain knowledge]] and processes for locating and contracting e-Government services was created for the three [[#Pilot_Applications|pilot applications]] of the project. The requirement-driven approach <ref name="Ralf Klischewski 2007, pp. 133-140">Ralf Klischewski, Stefan Ukena: ''Designing semantic e-Government services driven by user requirements''.

The core Access-eGov system was implemented as an extension of the [[WSMO]] conceptual model <ref>Mach, M., Bednár, P., Hreňo, J.: Execution and composition of government services.

Matelica : Halley Editrice, 2007. pp.139–153. ISBN 978-88-7589-300-2.</ref>. The solution includes two client side tools – ''Personal Assistant client'', which provides browsing of the scenarios and services for citizens, and ''Annotation tool'' enabling semantic annotation of services for public administrations. The Access-eGov solution was tested within the first trial in autumn 2007 <ref>ePractice.eu: Access-eGov completes first pilot trials. 11 April 2008. http://www.epractice.eu/document/4562</ref>. Results of the testing were evaluated and were taken as a background for further improvements. Currently (second half of year 2008) the Access-eGov project approaches its final phase, which includes second trial of all the pilot applications and final evaluation of achieved results. ==Pilot Applications== ===German field test – "Getting married" scenario=== The field test was carried out by Ministry of Finance of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. It was focused on the life event "marriage" and related procedures. The [[Registration of births, deaths and marriages|registry offices]] of eleven municipalities from Schleswig-Holstein have been involved in this field test. The main aim was to test the integration of different web resources containing the service information and making them accessible via a single platform but still leaving the data and its maintenance in the municipalities' legacy systems. ===Slovak pilot – "Obtaining a building permission" scenario=== The pilot application has been carried out by the [[Kosice Self-governing Region|Košice Self-Governing Region]] and the municipality of [[Michalovce]]. It was focused on supporting citizens during the process of obtaining a [[Building permit]], including complex services related to [[Land-use planning]] and approval proceedings. The objective was to make the whole process easier and transparent for citizens, to provide all relevant information about necessary services in a comprehensive and user-friendly way, and finally to improve the service from the citizen's point of view. ===Polish pilot – "Establishing an enterprise" scenario=== The pilot application took place in the Silesian region and was performed by the [[Gliwice]] City Hall. The user scenario involved four main user goals: registration in local government, registration in statistical office, registration in [[tax]] office and registration in [[Social insurance]] agency. The objective of the pilot application was to provide a single entry point where users (citizens and entrepreneurs) can obtain relevant information and are properly navigated by the system within the whole complex process. ==Project outcomes== * ''The Access-eGov core system'', including inner components for discovery, composition, mediation, and execution of the semantically annotated services.<ref>Karol Furdik, Tomas Sabol, Peter Bednar: ''Framework for integration of e-Government Services on a Semantic Basis''.

The method originally designed and developed within the Access-eGov project by one of the project partners ([[German University in Cairo]]), was used as the main resource for ontology creation. This approach provides a generic method how to collect, relate, and formally express the information needs of the public administrations, as service providers, to design the specific semantic structures and descriptions of provided governmental services. * ''Resource [[Ontology|ontologies]]'', proposed as the specification of system data for the services and workflow structures within the Access-eGov system.<ref>D7.1 Public administration resource ontologies.

The tool is designed as a standard web application, using the extended WSMO object model and [[JavaServer Faces|JSF]] technology. ** ''Personal Assistant client'', a tool that provides browsing, discovery, and execution capabilities of the services for citizens and businesses according to a specified life event or goal. Users can browse sub-goals and provide their answers when customization input is requested. Then the system automatically resolves the sub-goals and navigates the
