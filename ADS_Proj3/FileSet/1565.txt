at least two branches of simultaneous development. The ''-CURRENT'' branch always represents the "[[bleeding edge]]" of FreeBSD development. A ''-STABLE'' branch of FreeBSD is created for each major version number, from which releases are cut about once every 4â€“6 months. If a feature is sufficiently stable and mature it will likely be [[backport]]ed (''MFC'' or ''Merge from CURRENT'' in FreeBSD developer slang) to the ''-STABLE'' branch.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html | title = FAQ Chapter 1 Introduction | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-01-30 }} </ref> FreeBSD's development model is further described in an article by Niklas Saers.<ref name=dev-model>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/dev-model/|title=A project model for the FreeBSD Project|last=Saers|first=Niklas|publisher=freebsd.org|date=[[2002]]|accessdate=2007-03-03}}</ref> ===Foundation=== FreeBSD development is supported in part by the FreeBSD Foundation. The foundation is a non-profit organization that accepts donations to fund FreeBSD development. Such funding has been used to sponsor developers for specific activities, purchase hardware and network infrastructure, provide travel grants to developer summits, and provide legal support to the FreeBSD project.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/about.shtml | title = About the FreeBSD Foundation | publisher = The FreeBSD Foundation | accessdate=2009-09-06 }} </ref> ==License== FreeBSD is released under a variety of open source licenses. The kernel code and most newly created code is released under the two-clause [[BSD license]] which allows everyone to use and redistribute FreeBSD as they wish. There are parts released under three- and four-clause BSD licenses, as well as [[Beerware]] license. Some device drivers include a [[binary blob]], such as the [[Atheros]] [[Hardware abstraction layer|HAL]] of FreeBSD versions before 7.2.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/copyright.html | title = FreeBSD Copyright and Legal Information | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-01-30 }} </ref> Some of the code contributed by other projects is licensed under [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], [[ISC license|ISC]] or [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]]. All the code licensed under [[GPL]] and [[CDDL]] is clearly separated from the code under liberal licenses, to make it easy for users such as embedded device manufacturers to use only [[permissive free software license]]s. ClangBSD aims to replace some [[GPL]] dependencies in the FreeBSD base system by replacing the [[GNU compiler collection]] with the BSD-licenced [[LLVM]]/[[Clang]] compiler. ClangBSD became self-hosting on April 16 2010<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/23166/ClangBSD_Is_Selfhosting_We_Need_Testers_Now | title = ClangBSD Is Selfhosting, We Need Testers Now | publisher = osnews.com | date = 2010-04-17 | accessdate=2010-05-13 }}</ref>, an important landmark for further independent development. ==Logo== [[File:Bsd daemon.jpg|thumb|FreeBSD's mascot is the generic [[BSD daemon]], also known as ''Beastie''.]] For many years FreeBSD's logo was the generic [[BSD daemon]], also called ''Beastie'', a slurred phonetic pronunciation of ''BSD''. First appearing in 1976 on UNIX T-shirts purchased by [[Bell Labs]], the more popular versions of the BSD daemon were drawn by animation director [[John Lasseter]] beginning in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=mckusick.com|url=http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/shirts/usenix.html|title=Usenix|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=minnie.tuhs.org|url=http://minnie.tuhs.org/Seminars/Saving_Unix/|title=Saving UNIX from /dev/null|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=frbsd.org|url=http://www.frbsd.org/fr/chuck.html|title=Chuck's Corner|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> Several FreeBSD-specific versions were later drawn by Tatsumi Hosokawa.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=freebsd.org|url=http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/daemon.html|title=The BSD Daemon|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref> Through the years Beastie became both beloved and criticized as perhaps inappropriate for corporate and mass market exposure. Moreover it was not unique to FreeBSD. In lithographic terms, the Lasseter graphic is not [[line art]] and often requires a screened, four colour [[Offset printing#Photo offset|photo offset]] printing process for faithful reproduction on physical surfaces such as paper. Moreover, the BSD daemon was thought to be too graphically detailed for smooth size scaling and aesthetically over dependent upon multiple colour gradations, making it hard to reliably reproduce as a simple, standardized logo in only two or three colours, much less in monochrome. Because of these worries, a competition was held and a new logo designed by Anton K. Gural, still echoing the BSD daemon, was released on October 8, 2005.<ref name=logo-result>{{cite web|url=http://logo-contest.freebsd.org/result/|title=Final result for the FreeBSD logo design competition|publisher=freebsd.org|date=[[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> Meanwhile Lasseter's much known take on the BSD daemon carries forth as official mascot of the FreeBSD Project. ==Derivatives== [[File:711-screenshot.png|thumb|[[PC-BSD]]]] There are a number of software distributions based on FreeBSD including: * [[DesktopBSD]] (aimed at home users and workstations) * [[PC-BSD]] (aimed at home users and workstations) * [[FreeSBIE]] ([[live CD]]) * Frenzy ([[live CD]]) * [[GhostBSD]] (Gnome-based live CD) * [[m0n0wall]] (firewall) * [[pfSense]] (firewall) * [[FreeNAS]] (for network attached storage) * [[AskoziaPBX]] (an embedded PBX) All these distributions have no or only minor changes when compared with the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with [[Linux]] distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and also use the same basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding. Besides these distributions there is [[DragonFly BSD]], a fork from FreeBSD 4.8 aiming for a different multiprocessor synchronization strategy than the one chosen for FreeBSD 5 and development of some [[microkernel]] features. It doesn't aim to stay compatible with FreeBSD and has huge differences in the kernel and basic [[Userland (computing)|userland]]. A wide variety of products are directly or indirectly based on FreeBSD. Examples of embedded devices based on FreeBSD include: * [[Citrix]] Netscalers * [[F5 Networks]]'s 3DNS version 3 global traffic manager and EDGE-FX version 1 web cache (NB These are now end of life with 3DNS functionality being moved to the Linux based BIGIP Platform) * [[Ironport]] network security appliances * [[Juniper Networks]] routers, switches and security devices * [[KACE Networks]]'s KBOX 1000 & 2000 Series Appliances and the Virtual KBOX Appliance * [[NCircle Entertainment|nCircle's]] IP360 * [[NetApp]]'s Data ONTAP GX (only as a loader for proprietary kernel-space module of ONTAP GX and 8.x) * [[Netasq]] security appliances * [[Nokia]]'s [[Nokia IPSO|firewall operating system]] * [[Panasas]]'s and [[Isilon Systems]]'s cluster storage operating systems * The [[PlayStation 3]] video game console.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scei.co.jp/ps3-license/index.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref> * [[Sophos]]'s Email Appliance<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sophos.com/support/knowledgebase/article/14384.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> * [[St. Bernard Software]] iPrism web filtering appliances<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stbernard.com/docs/releasenotes/iPrism_6-2xx.pdf |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref> * [[Panasonic]]'s 2010 TV models ([[Plasma display|PDP]]
