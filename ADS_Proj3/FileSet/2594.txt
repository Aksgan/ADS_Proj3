Only a sample and the palette's name are given here. More specific articles are linked from the name of each palette, for the test charts, samples, simulated images, and further technical details (including references). In the past, manufacturers have developed many different display systems in a competitive, non-collaborative basis (with a few exceptions, as the [[VESA]] consortium), creating many proprietary, non-standard different instances of display [[computer hardware|hardware]]. Often, as with early [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s, a given machine employed its unique display subsystem, with its also unique color palette. Also, [[Computer software|software]] developers had made use of the color abilities of distinct display systems in many different ways. The result is that there is no single common standard nomenclature or classification taxonomy which can encompass every computer color palette. In order to organize the material, color palettes have been grouped following arbitrary but rational criteria. First, generic monochrome and full [[RGB]] repertories common to various computer display systems. Second, usual color repertories used for display systems that employ [[indexed color]] techniques. And finally, specific manufacturers' color palettes implemented in many representative early [[personal computer]]s and [[video game console|videogame console]]s of various brands. The list for personal computer palettes is split into two categories: [[8-bit]] and [[16-bit]] machines. This is not intended as a true strict categorization of such machines, because mixed architectures also exist (16-bit [[Central processing unit|processor]]s with an 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] or 32-bit processors with a 16-bit data bus, among others). The distinction is based more on broad 8-bit and 16-bit computer ''ages'' or ''generations'' (around 1975&ndash;1985 and 1985&ndash;1995, respectively) and their associated [[state of the art]] in color display capabilities. Here is the common color test chart and sample image used to render every palette in this series of articles: :{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0" |- || [[Image:RGB 24bits palette sample image.jpg]] || [[Image:RGB 24bits palette color test chart.png]] |} See further details in the summary paragraph of the corresponding article. ==List of monochrome and RGB palettes== {{main|List of monochrome and RGB palettes}} For the purpose of this article, the term ''monochrome palette'' means a set of intensities for a monochrome display, and the term ''RGB palette'' is defined as the complete set of combinations a given [[RGB]] display can offer by mixing all the possible intensities of the red, green, and blue primaries available in its hardware. These are generic complete repertories of colors to produce black and white and RGB color pictures by the display hardware, not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine. RGB is the most common method to produce colors for displays; so these complete RGB color repertories have every possible combination of R-G-B triplets within any given maximum number of levels per component. For specific hardware and different methods to produce colors than [[RGB]], see the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of computer hardware palettes]] and the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of videogame consoles]] sections. For various software arrangements and sorts of colors, including other possible full RGB arrangements within 8-bit [[color depth|depth]] displays, see the [[List of palettes#List of software palettes|List of software palettes]] section. ===Monochrome palettes=== :These palettes only have some shades of gray. :{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="5" |- | [[Image:Bilevel 1bit palette sample image.png]] | [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#Monochrome (1-bit)|Monochrome (1-bit)]]<br/>black and white | [[File:Bilevel 1bit palette sample image - gimp dithered.png]] | Monochrome (1-bit) black and white, with [[Floyd-Steinberg dithering]] |- | [[Image:Grayscale 2bit palette sample image.png]] | [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#2-bit Grayscale|2-bit Grayscale]]<br/>2<sup>2</sup> = 4 levels of gray | [[File:Grayscale 2bit palette sample image - gimp dithered.png]] | 4 levels of gray, with Floyd-Steinberg dithering |- | [[Image:Grayscale 4bit palette sample image.png]] | [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#4-bit Grayscale|4-bit Grayscale]]<br/>2<sup>4</sup> = 16 levels of gray | [[File:Grayscale 4bit palette sample image - gimp dithered.png]] | 16 levels of gray, with Floyd-Steinberg dithering |- | [[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette sample image.png]] | [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#8-bit Grayscale|8-bit Grayscale]]<br/>2<sup>8</sup> = 256 levels of gray |- |} ===Regular RGB palettes=== :These full RGB palettes employ the same number of [[bit]]s to store the relative intensity for the red, green and blue components of every image's [[pixel]] color. Thus, they have the same number of levels per channel and the total number of possible colors is always the cube of a power of two. :{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="5" |- || [[Image:RGB 3bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#3-bit RGB|3-bit RGB]]<br/>2<sup>3</sup> = 8 colors || [[File:RGB 24bits palette sample image - 3-bit RGB.png]] || 3-bit RGB, with [[Floyd-Steinberg dithering]] |- || [[Image:RGB 6bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|6-bit RGB]]<br/>4<sup>3</sup> = 64 colors |- || [[Image:RGB 9bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB]]<br/>8<sup>3</sup> = 512 colors |- || [[Image:RGB 12bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB]]<br/>16<sup>3</sup> = 4096 colors |- || [[Image:RGB 15bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB]]<br/>32<sup>3</sup> = 32,768 colors ([[HighColor]]) |- || [[Image:RGB 18bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB]]<br/>64<sup>3</sup> = 262,144 colors |- || [[Image:RGB 24bits palette sample image.jpg]] || [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]]<br/>256<sup>3</sup> = 16,777,216 colors ([[TrueColor]]) |- |} ===Non-regular RGB palettes=== :These are also RGB palettes, in the sense defined above (except for the 4-bit RGBI, which has an intensity bit that affects all channels at once), but either they do not have the same number of levels for each primary channel, or the numbers are not powers of two, so are not represented as separate bit fields.
