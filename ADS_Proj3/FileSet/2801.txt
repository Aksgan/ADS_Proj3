The rover needs about 100 watts to drive. Its power system includes two rechargeable [[lithium ion]] batteries weighing 7.15 kg (16 pounds) each, that provide energy when the sun is not shining, especially at night. Over time, the batteries will degrade and will not be able to recharge to full capacity. For comparison, the future [[Mars Science Laboratory]]'s power system is composed of a [[Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator]] (MMRTG) produced by Boeing.<ref name="MSLPower">{{Cite web|url=http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/technology/tech_power.html |title=Technologies of Broad Benefit: Power |accessdate=2008-09-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080614071650/http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/technology/tech_power.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> The MMRTG is designed to provide 125W of electrical power at the start of the mission, falling to 100W after 14 years of service.<ref>http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMIECEC06_1309/PV2006_4187.pdf</ref> It will be used to power the MSL's many systems and instruments. Solar panels were also considered for the MSL, but RTGs provide constant power, regardless of the time of day, and thus the versatility to work in dark environments and high latitudes where solar energy is not readily available. The MSL will generate 2.5 [[kilowatt hour]]s per day, compared to the Mars Exploration Rovers, which can generate about 0.6 kilowatt hours per day.<ref name="MSLUSAToday">{{Cite news|title=Troubles parallel ambitions in NASA Mars project |publisher=USA Today |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2008-04-13-mars_N.htm |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2009-05-27 | first=Traci | last=Watson}}</ref> It was thought that by the end of the 90-sol mission, the capability of the solar arrays to generate power would likely be reduced to about 50 watts. This was due to anticipated dust coverage on the solar arrays, and the change in season. Over three Earth years later, however, the rovers' power supplies hovered between 300 [[watt-hour]]s and 900 watt-hours per day, depending on dust coverage. Cleaning events (dust removal by wind) have occurred more often than NASA expected, keeping the arrays relatively free of dust and extending the life of the mission. During a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, both rovers experienced some of the lowest power of the mission; ''Opportunity'' dipped to 128 watt-hours. In November 2008, Spirit had overtaken this low-energy record with a production of 89 watt-hours, due to dust storms in the region of Gusev crater.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6909656.stm|accessdate=2007-07-22|title=Mars dust storms threaten rovers | work=BBC News | date=July 21, 2007}}</ref> The rovers run a [[VxWorks]] [[embedded operating system]] on a [[Radiation hardened|radiation-hardened]] 20 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[RAD6000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] with 128 [[megabyte|MB]] of [[DRAM]] with error detection and correction and 3 MB of [[EEPROM]]. Each rover also has 256 MB of [[flash memory]]. To survive during the various mission phases, the rover's vital instruments must stay within a temperature of −40 °C to +40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F). At night, the rovers are heated by eight [[radioisotope heater units]] (RHU), which each continuously generate 1 [[watt|W]] of thermal energy from the decay of [[radioisotope]]s, along with electrical heaters that operate only when necessary. A sputtered [[gold]] film and a layer of [[silica]] [[aerogel]] are used for insulation. ===Communication=== The rover has a [[low-gain antenna|low-gain]] and a [[high-gain antenna]]. The low-gain antenna is [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]], and transmits data at a low rate to [[Deep Space Network]] (DSN) antennas on Earth. The high-gain antenna is directional and steerable, and can transmit data to Earth at a higher rate. The rovers also use the low-gain antennas to communicate with spacecraft orbiting Mars, the [[Mars Odyssey]] and (before its failure) the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]. The orbiters relay data from and to Earth; most data to Earth is relayed through Odyssey. The orbiters are closer to the rovers than the antennas on Earth, and have a view of Earth for much longer than the rovers. The orbiters communicate with the rovers using UHF antennas, which have shorter range than the low and high-gain antennas. One UHF antenna is on the rover, and one is on a petal of the lander to aid in gaining information during the critical landing event. The rovers have a total of 9 cameras, which produce 1024-pixel by 1024-pixel images at 12 bits per pixel,[http://216.239.41.104/search?q=cache:qdeH3xRDiEEJ:tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-155/155J.pdf+&hl=en&ie=UTF-8] but most navigation camera images and image thumbnails are truncated to 8 bits per pixel to conserve memory and transmission time. All images are then compressed using [[ICER]] before being stored and sent to Earth. Navigation, thumbnail, and many other image types are compressed to approximately 0.8 to 1.1 bits/pixel. Lower bit rates (less than 0.5 bit/pixel) are used for certain wavelengths of multi-color panoramic images. ICER is based on [[wavelets]], and was designed specifically for deep-space applications. It produces progressive compression, both lossless and lossy, and incorporates an error-containment scheme to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel. It outperforms the lossy JPEG image compressor and the lossless Rice compressor used by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. ===Scientific instrumentation=== [[File:MER Pancam.JPG|thumb|right|Panoramic Camera (Pancam)]] [[Image:MER Rock Abrasion Tool.JPG|thumb|right|Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT)]] [[Image:MER APXS PIA05113.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alpha particle]] [[X-Ray]] Spectrometer ([[APXS]]) (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]] The rover has various instruments. Three are mounted on one assembly: * Panoramic Camera (Pancam), for determining the texture, color, [[mineralogy]], and structure of the local terrain. * Navigation Camera (Navcam), that has higher field of view but lower resolution and is monochromatic, for navigation and driving. * A mirror for the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer ([[Mini-TES]]), which identifies promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determines the processes that formed them. It was built by [[Arizona State University]]. The cameras are mounted 1.5 meters high on the Pancam Mast Assembly. One motor turns the assembly horizontally a whole revolution. Another points the cameras vertically, at most straight up or down. A third motor points the Mini-TES, up to 30° above the horizon and 50° below. The assembly
