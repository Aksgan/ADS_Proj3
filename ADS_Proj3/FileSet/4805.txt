It was developed by [[Hugh R. Wilson]] and [[Jack D. Cowan]]<ref name="wil72">[http://www.cell.com/biophysj/retrieve/pii/S0006349572860685 H.R. Wilson and J.D. Cowan.

Cybern. 81:131-147 (1999)]</ref> The model is important historically because it uses phase plane methods and numerical solutions to describe the responses of neuronal populations to stimuli. Because the model neurons are simple, only elementary limit cycle behavior, i.e. [[neural oscillations]], and stimulus-dependent evoked responses are predicted. The key findings include the existence of multiple stable states, and hysteresis, in the population response. ==Mathematical description== The Wilson-Cowan model considers a homogeneous population of interconnected neurons of excitatory and inhibitory subtypes. The fundamental quantity is the measure of the activity of an excitatory or inhibitory subtype within the population. More precisely, <math>E(t)</math> and <math>I(t)</math> are respectively the proportions of excitatory and inhibitory cells firing at time t. They depend on the proportion of sensitive cells (that are not refractory) and on the proportion of these cells receiving at least threshold excitation. ===Sensitive cells=== Proportion of cells in refractory period (absolute refractory period <math>r</math>) <math>\int_{t-r}^{t}E(t')dt'</math> Proportion of sensitive cells (complement of refractory cells) <math>1-\int_{t-r}^{t}E(t')dt'</math> ===Excited cells=== Subpopulation response function based on <math>D(\theta)</math> the distribution of neuronal thresholds <math>S(x)=\int_{0}^{x(t)}D(\theta)d\theta</math> Subpopulation response function based on the distribution of afferent synapses per cell (all cells have the same threshold) <math>S(x)=\int_{\frac{\theta}{x(t)}}^{\infty}C(w)dw</math> Average excitation level <math>\int_{-\infty}^{t}\alpha(t-t')[c_1 E(t)-c_2 I(t')+P(t')]dt'</math> where <math>\alpha(t)</math> is the stimulus decay function, <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math> are respectively the connectivity coefficient giving the average number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses per cell, P(t) is the external input to the excitatory population.

From 1967 he was a member, and from 1978 until 2003 he was the chairman of the ''Dutch COBOL Commission'' ("Nederlandse COBOL Commissie"). From 1998 until 2001 he was a member of the ''[[NCITS]]/[[ANSI]] COBOL commission X3J4'' and in that position he designed or re-wrote dozens parts of the current COBOL standard. As member and chairman of the examining-board ''T2-Cobol'' Ebbinkhuijsen was active for a number of years with Exin (''EXamenINstituut'', "Dutch examination Institute") . He also wrote the course-books for this exam. On October 22, 2004 after 42 years Ebbinghuijsen left the Cobol world, with a valedictory symposium in the auditorium of the [[Vrije Universiteit]] of [[Amsterdam]]. For his enormous contribution to COBOL he received an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] award, as well as the Dutch royal distinction, [[Knighted]] in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] (''Ridder in de Orde van Oranje Nassau''). ==External links== * [http://www.cs.vu.nl/Cobol/ valedictory symposium VU, Amsterdam] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME =Ebbinkhuijsen, Wim | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ebbinkhuijsen, Wim}} [[Category:1939 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Dutch computer scientists]] [[Category:People from Amsterdam]] [[Category:Knights of the Order of Orange-Nassau]] [[nl:Wim Ebbinkhuijsen]] [[sk:Wim Ebbinkhuijsen]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40239</id> <title>Windows 2000</title> <text>{{pp-move-indef}} {{Infobox OS version |name = Windows 2000 |family = Microsoft Windows |logo = Windows 2000 logo.png |screenshot = Win2000.png<!-- 1024x768 has more detail than a 800x600 picture, which creates clutterness; this picture also has an explorer window --> |caption = Screenshot of Windows 2000 Professional |developer = Microsoft |website = [http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000 Official Website] |first_release_date = '''Retail:''' 17 February 2000 |first_release_url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/Dec99/W2KrtmPR.mspx |release_version = 5.0 (Build 2195: Service Pack 4) |release_date = {{Start date and age|2005|9|13|df=yes}} |release_url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/891861 |source_model = [[Shared source]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/Licensing/Enterprise.mspx|title=Enterprise Source Licensing Program|accessdate=2007-04-05|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref> |license = Microsoft [[EULA]] |kernel_type = [[Hybrid kernel]] |updatemodel = [[Windows Update]] |supported_platforms = [[IA-32]], [[Itanium]] |support_status = Unsupported as of 13 July 2010<ref name="Lifecycle" /> }} '''Windows 2000''' is a line of [[operating system]]s produced by [[Microsoft]] for use on [[personal computers]], business desktops, [[laptop]]s, and [[Server (computing)|servers]].

It was succeeded by [[Windows XP]] for desktop systems in October 2001 and [[Windows Server 2003]] for servers in April 2003. [[Windows Me]] was released seven months after Windows 2000 and one year before Windows XP, but Windows Me was not intended to be, nor did it serve as the successor to Windows 2000. Windows Me was designed for home use, while Windows 2000 was designed for business.
