Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] added him to the newly formed Macintosh team in February, 1981. Working for [[Bud Tribble]] alongside [[Bill Atkinson]] and [[Burrell Smith]], Hertzfeld became a primary software architect of the [[Mac OS|Macintosh Operating System]], which was considered revolutionary in its use of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) where [[Jef Raskin]] also made significant contributions. ===After Apple (1984–present)=== Since leaving Apple in 1984, Hertzfeld has co-founded three new companies &mdash; [[Radius (computer)|Radius]] (1986), [[General Magic]] (1990) and [[Eazel]] (1999). At Eazel, he helped to create the [[Nautilus file manager]] for [[Linux|Linux's]] [[GNOME]] desktop. He volunteered for [[OSAF]] in 2002 and 2003, writing early prototypes of ''[[Chandler (PIM)|Chandler]]'', their information manager. In 1996, Hertzfeld was interviewed by [[Robert Cringely]] on the television show ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'', and was again interviewed by Cringely on NerdTV in 2005. In early 2004, he started ''folklore.org'', a [[web site]] devoted to collective storytelling that contains dozens of [[anecdote]]s about the development of the original Macintosh. The stories have been collected in an [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] book, ''Revolution in the Valley'', published in December 2004. In August 2005, Hertzfeld joined [[Google]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/technology/22google.html | work=The New York Times | title=Where Does Google Plan to Spend $4 Billion? | first=John | last=Markoff | date=August 22, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> <br clear="all" /> ==References== *{{cite book|author=Hertzfeld, Andy | authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld|year=2004 | title=Revolution in the Valley|publisher=[[O'Reilly|O'Reilly Books]]|isbn=0-596-00719-1}} *Deutschman, Alan (2000).

He is approximately 7 feet tall, has very large data banks and dictionaries, can reproduce music, and is superhumanly strong and near superhumanly fast. He was made by Lamerk Industries an indeterminate number of years ago (Andy says that he may have been built more than two thousand years before). Andy seems to enjoy talking to the people of the Calla; in fact some of the people mention that he sometimes will not shut up. He tells horoscopes, although they seem to be in the same vein as horoscopes one might find in a newspaper. [[Roland Deschain]] and his ka-tet encounter Andy, along with a few villagers, a few miles outside of [[Calla Bryn Sturgis]], a village that lies along the Beam (their road to the Dark Tower). While the villagers tend to trust Andy and even thank him for telling them the bad news of the Wolves coming, Roland and his party, partly due to prior experience with [[Blaine the Mono]], tend to distrust the intent behind his words. Andy turns out to be the primary antagonist of the book, being the agent of the Red that relays information to a [[taheen]] named Finli o'Tego in Thunderclap. Additionally he seems to act as Ben Slightman's handler, as Ben is also reporting on events in the Calla, especially the events surrounding Roland and his ka-tet. {{DarkTower}} [[Category:Fictional robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1905</id> <title>Angela Orebaugh</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Cleanup|date=November 2007}} '''Angela Orebaugh''' (1973) is a cyber security technologist, scientist, and author.
