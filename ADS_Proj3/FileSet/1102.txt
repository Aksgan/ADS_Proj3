interface to db4o database OME provide some administrative functions as: * Indexing * Defragmentation * Backup OME was initially suggested to the customers as a commercial product only available to dDN subscribers. From the db4o version 7.8 OME was included into standard db4o distribution and the source was made available to the public in db4o svn repository, i.e: https://source.db4o.com/db4o/trunk/enterprise == Community == Over the years the community of db4o registered members has grown to over 60,000 members.<ref>http://developer.db4o.com/</ref> Many important db4o-related projects, such as standalone Object Manager, encryption support, Mono support etc., are fully driven by community members. db4o's [http://developer.db4o.com/Projects/ Code Commander program] defines the terms and conditions of community project development. db4o provides free access to its code, documentation, forums and releases to the community members. The community votes for most important features and most critical bugs is taken into consideration when defining the road map and weekly iteration plans. From time to time db4o holds different contests<ref>http://developer.db4o.com/ProjectSpaces/view.aspx/PerformanceContest</ref> allowing the community members to come up with the best suggestion for an improvement of a specific db4o aspect, which are later on integrated into the core code. == Development process == The db4o team uses [[Extreme Programming]] (XP) practices. Some of the tools used in the development process include: * [[JIRA]]<ref>http://tracker.db4o.com/</ref> is used for close tracking of the development process, progress reporting, prioritization of tasks, and collecting user feedback. * [[Subversion (software)|SVN]]<ref>https://source.db4o.com/</ref> is used for [[version control]]. * A [[wiki]]<ref>http://developer.db4o.com/wiki</ref> is used for collaboration on design and documentation, as well as process notes. == Versions == db4o releases development, production and stable builds. Development version provides the newest features and is released for testing, community feedback and evaluation. Production version is meant to be used in production environment and includes features that have been already evaluated and proven by time. Stable version is meant to be used in final product shipment. db4o also runs a continuous build, which is triggered by any new change committed to the SVN code repository. This build is open to community and can be used to evaluate the latest changes and get the newest features hot. db4o build name format is meant to provide all the necessary information about the version, time of build and supported platform: For example: db4o-7.2.30.9165-java.zip db4o – name of the product, i.e. db4o database engine 7.2 – the release number 30 – iteration number, i.e. a sequential number identifying a development week 9165 – svn revision number, corresponding to the last commit that triggered the build java – Java version of db4o. .NET version is identified by “net” for .NET 2.0 releases or “net35” for .NET 3.5 version. .NET version includes the corresponding Compact Framework release. db4o public SVN repository is also available for the developers to get the source code and build versions locally with or without custom modifications.

Because the interpretation is taken ''before'' to pass the page to browser, xBase code can be used to feed Javascript functions with live data, in response to different contexts or conditions. *Database support is built-in into the interpreter, thus no other software is needed to feed data to [[web page]]s; the default drivers provided with installation package give access to standard [[dBASE|DBF]] tables (level 3) used by dBase III. Other commercial drivers are available, including [[Clipper (programming language)|Clipper]], [[FoxPro]], visual dBase and [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]], but not included. Tables in use by the web application can be accessed via internet from remote clients using web browser concurrently with users using other software capable to manage the DBF file format on the LAN side, like the latest versions of [http://www.dbase.com dBase Plus]. *Web pages can also be written using dBase syntax, although in both cases (Clipper 87 or dBase syntax) only commands that make sense in the specific environment of a web page are recognized.Commands include logic branching with IF..ENDIF, looping with DO..WHILE, FOR..NEXT and DO CASE..ENDCASE. MaxScript commands and functions give complete access to host's file system with SET ALTERNATE or memoread() and memowrite() functions. The webserver (being the preconfigured [[Xitami]]
