was A.H. Frost’s original definition of nasik.<br> A ''nasik'' magic cube would have 13 magic lines passing through each of it’s ''m''<sup>3</sup> cells. (This cube also contains 9''m'' pandiagonal magic squares of order ''m''.)<br> A ''nasik'' magic tesseract would have 40 lines passing through each of it’s ''m''<sup>4</sup> cells.<br> And so on. == Background support == In 1866 and 1878, Rev. A. H. Frost coined the term ''Nasik'' for the type of magic square we commonly call ''pandiagonal'' and often call ''perfect''. He then demonstrated the concept with an order-7 cube we now class as ''pandiagonal'', and an order-8 cube we class as ''pantriagonal''.<ref>Frost, A.

H., ''On the General Properties of Nasik Squares'', QJM, 15, 1878, pp 34-49</ref><br> In another 1878 paper he showed another ''pandiagonal'' magic cube and a cube where all 13''m'' lines sum correctly<ref>Frost, A. H. ''On the General Properties of Nasik Cubes'', QJM, 15, 1878, pp 93-123</ref> i.e. Hendricks ''perfect''.<ref>Heinz, H.D., and Hendricks, J.R., ''Magic Square Lexicon: Illustrated'', 2000, 0-9687985-0-0 pp 119-122</ref> He referred to all of these cubes as '''''nasik'''''!<br> In 1905 Dr. Planck expanded on the nasik idea in his Theory of Paths Nasik. In the introductory to his paper, he wrote; {{Quotation|Analogy suggest that in the higher dimensions we ought to employ the term nasik as implying the existence of magic summations parallel to any diagonal, and not restrict it to diagonals in sections parallel to the plane faces. The term is used in this wider sense throughout the present paper.| C.

Introductory letter to the paper.</ref>}} In 1917, Dr. Planck wrote again on this subject. {{Quotation|It is not difficult to perceive that if we push the Nasik analogy to higher dimensions the number of magic directions through any cell of a k-fold must be ½(3<sup>k</sup>-1).| W. S. Andrews, Magic Squares and Cubes, Dover Publ., 1917, page 366 <ref>Andrews, W. S., Magic Squares and Cubes, Dover Publ. 1917. Essay pages 363-375 written by C. Planck</ref>}} In 1939, B. Rosser and R. J. Walker published a series of papers on diabolic (perfect) magic squares and cubes. They specifically mentioned that these cubes contained 13''m''<sup>2</sup> correctly summing lines. They also had 3''m'' pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the faces of the cube, and 6''m'' pandiagonal magic squares parallel to the triagonal planes.<ref>Rosser, B. and Walker, R. J., ''Magic Squares: Published papers and Supplement'', 1939. A bound volume at Cornell University, catalogued as QA 165 R82+pt.1-4</ref> == Conclusion == If the term '''''nasik''''' is adopted as the definition for a magic hypercube where all possible lines sum correctly, there will no longer be confusion over what exactly is a Perfect magic cube. And, as in Hendricks definition of perfect, all pan-''r''-agonals sum correctly, and all lower dimension hypercubes contained in it are '''''nasik''''' (Hendricks perfect). == See also == [[Magic hypercube]] [[Magic hypercubes]] [[Magic cube]] [[Magic cube classes]] [[Perfect magic cube]] [[Magic tesseract]] [[John R.

Gebelli worked for [[Sirius Software]] and [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]), and also created his own company, [[Gebelli Software]]. ==Sirius Software and Gebelli Software== Born in [[Iran]], Gebelli later moved to the [[United States]] to study [[computer science]]. In 1980, Gebelli started Sirius Software with Jerry Jewell. While part of Sirius Software, Gebelli developed advanced graphics techniques for the [[Apple II]]. At this time, Gebelli gained a reputation for producing games at a rapid pace; among those games produced were his best-selling games, ''[[Space Eggs]]'' and ''[[Gorgon (computer game)|Gorgon]]''. In 1981, Gebelli left Sirius to establish his own software company, Gebelli Software, through which he released ''[[Horizon V]]''. However, his company didn't prove very successful, and the [[video game crash of 1983]] sounded the death knell for Gebelli Software. ==Time at Square== After Gebelli Software went bankrupt, Gebelli went on a long vacation traveling the world. He resurfaced in 1986 and went to visit his friend [[Doug Carlston]], owner of [[Brøderbund]]. Gebelli was interested in developing games again; Carlston told him about the rise of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and that Nasir should start programming on it. Gebelli was interested, and so Doug offered to fly to [[Japan]] with Nasir and introduce him to his friends at [[Nintendo]] and Square. Nasir met with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] at Nintendo and several people at Square. Nintendo was apparently uninterested; the programmers at Square (especially [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], a long-time fan of Gebelli's work), however, were aware of Nasir's reputation and were excited to have him join. Gebelli arrived at Square around the same time as [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] and [[Takashi Tokita]] became employed there. Along with Sakaguchi, their combined appearance culminated in the separation of the “[[Square Co.|Square]]” label from parent software company [[Denyuusha]]. While at Square, Nasir first programmed the game ''Tobidase Daisakusen'' for the [[Famicom Disk System]], which released in the U.S. as ''[[3-D Worldrunner]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]; his second Square project was ''[[Rad Racer]]''. Gebelli then teamed up with Sakaguchi, [[Nobuo Uematsu]], and [[Yoshitaka Amano]] as part of Square's A-Team to produce ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''. He went on to program ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy III]]''. Midway through
