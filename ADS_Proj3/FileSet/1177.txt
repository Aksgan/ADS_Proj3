It originated in Europe, where it is the universal standard, replacing earlier cordless phone standards, such as 900 MHz [[CT1]] and [[CT2]].<ref name=rohde>{{cite web |url=http://www2.rohde-schwarz.com/en/technologies/Wireless_Connectivity/DECT/information/ |title=DECT Information}}</ref> Beyond Europe, it has been adopted by [[Australia]], and most countries in [[Asia]] and [[South America]]. North American adoption was delayed by [[United States]] radio frequency regulations. This forced development of a variation of DECT, called DECT 6.0, using a slightly different frequency range; the technology is nearly identical, but the frequency difference makes the technology inoperable with other compatible systems in other areas, even from the same manufacturer. DECT has almost universally replaced other standards in most countries where it is used, with the exception of North America. DECT is used primarily in home and small office systems, but is also available in many [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] systems for medium and large businesses. DECT can also be used for purposes other than cordless phones. Voice applications, such as [[baby monitor]]s, are becoming common. Data applications also exist, but have been eclipsed by [[Wi-Fi]]. [[3G cellular]] also competes with both DECT and Wi-Fi for both voice and data. DECT handsets and bases from different manufacturers typically work together at the most basic level of functionality: making and receiving calls. The DECT standard includes a standardized interoperability profile for simple telephone capabilities, called [[Generic access profile|GAP]], which most manufacturers implement. The standard also contains several other interoperability profiles, for data and for radio local-loop services. ==Application== The DECT standard fully specifies a means for a portable unit, such as a cordless telephone, to access a fixed telecoms network via radio. But, unlike the [[GSM]] standards, does not specify any internal aspects of the fixed network itself. Connectivity to the fixed network (which may be of many different kinds) is done through a [[base station]] or "Radio Fixed Part" to terminate the radio link, and a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] to connect calls to the fixed network. In most cases the gateway connection is to the [[public switched telephone network]] or telephone jack, although connectivity with newer technologies such as [[Voice over IP]] has become available. There are also other devices such as some [[baby monitor]]s utilizing DECT, and in these devices there is no gateway functionality. The DECT standard originally envisaged three major areas of application:<ref>{{ cite web |author = |year = 1997 |title = Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT); A high level guide to the DECT standardization |url = http://pda.etsi.org/pda/AQuery.asp?qSEARCH_STRING=ETR+178&qSEARCH_Type=EXACT&submit1=Search&qNB_TO_DISPLAY=10&qOFFSET=0&qSORT=DEFAULT |work = ETR 178 |publisher = European Telecommunications Standards Institute |accessdate = 2010-09-23 }}</ref> * Domestic cordless telephony, using a single base station to connect one or more handsets to the public telecoms network. * Enterprise premises cordless PABXs and wireless LANs, using many base stations for coverage. Calls continue as users move between different coverage cells, through a mechanism called handover. Calls can be both within the system and to the public telecoms network. * Public access, using large numbers of base stations to provide high capacity building or urban area coverage as part of a public telecoms network. Of these, the domestic application (cordless home telephones) has been extremely successful. The enterprise [[PABX]] market had some success, and all the major PABX vendors have offered DECT access options. The public access application did not succeed, since public cellular networks rapidly out-competed DECT by coupling their ubiquitous coverage with large increases in capacity and continuously falling costs. There has been only one major installation of DECT for public access: in early 1998 [[Telecom Italia]] launched a DECT network known as "Fido" after much regulatory delay, covering major cities in Italy.<ref>"Dect for Cordless Terminal Mobility" DECT Forum Newsletter 6th March 1998 [http://www.dectweb.com/DECTForum/news/NewsLettersPDF/nl199801.pdf]</ref> The service was promoted for only a few months and, having peaked at 142,000 subscribers, was shut down in 2001.<ref>[http://www.angelodenicola.it/articoli/messaggero/2000/2000_04_05.htm "LA TELECOM SPEGNE "FIDO"" Il Messaggero 5th April 2000]</ref> DECT has also been used for Fixed Wireless Access as a substitute for copper pairs in the "last mile" in countries such as India and South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By using directional antennas and sacrificing some traffic capacity, cell coverage could extend to over 10 km. In Europe the power limit laid down for use of the DECT spectrum (250 mW peak) was expressed in [[Effective radiated power|ERP]], rather than the more commonly-used [[EIRP]], permitting the use of high-gain directional antennas to produce much higher EIRP and hence long ranges. The standard is also used in electronic cash terminals, traffic lights, and remote door openers.<ref>https://dedected.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/25C3/talk-25c3.pdf</ref> ==VoIP/IP-DECT== In business, DECT has become an essential part of many PABX installations with manufacturer's proprietary methods of supporting PABX features over the DECT standard.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Since the onset of the migration from TDM PBXs to VoIP and VoIP hybrid solutions, manufacturers such as [http://www.lantiq.com/products/digital-cordless/ Lantiq], [[Ascom Wireless Solutions]], [[Aastra Technologies]], [[Philips]], [[Avaya]], [http://www.rtx.dk/ RTX Telecom], and [[Polycom]] have developed IP-DECT solutions where the backhaul from the base station is VoIP ([[H.323]] or [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]]) while the handset loop is still DECT. These solutions are sometimes restricted by the cost of the base station but may be economical where the concentration of users is high.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} PBX networking vendors such as Cisco promote the adoption of handsets that use VoIP over local [[Wifi]] as the replacement for DECT, but this imposes significant overhead on the design and complexity of the WiFi network in order to provide roaming, coverage and
