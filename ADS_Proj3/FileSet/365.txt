BLOSUM matrices are used to score alignments between evolutionarily divergent protein sequences. They are based on local alignments. BLOSUM matrices were first introduced in a paper by Henikoff and Henikoff.<ref name=henikoff>{{cite journal| date=1992| journal=PNAS | volume=89 | pages=10915–10919| pmid=1438297 | title = Amino Acid Substitution Matrices from Protein Blocks | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.22.10915 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=1438297 | author = Henikoff, S. | coauthors = Henikoff, J.G.| issue=22| pmc=50453}}</ref> They scanned the [[BLOCKS database]] for very conserved regions of protein families (that do not have gaps in the sequence alignment) and then counted the relative frequencies of [[amino acids]] and their substitution probabilities. Then, they calculated a [[odds ratio|log-odds]] score for each of the 210 possible substitutions of the 20 standard amino acids. All BLOSUM matrices are based on observed alignments; they are not extrapolated from comparisons of closely related proteins like the [[Point accepted mutation|PAM Matrices]]. Several sets of BLOSUM matrices exist using different alignment databases, named with numbers. BLOSUM matrices with high numbers are designed for comparing closely related sequences, while those with low numbers are designed for comparing distant related sequences. For example, BLOSUM80 is used for less divergent alignments, and BLOSUM45 is used for more divergent alignments. The matrices were created by merging (clustering) all sequences that were more similar than a given percentage into one single sequence and then comparing those sequences (that were all more divergent than the given percentage value) only; thus reducing the contribution of closely related sequences. The percentage used was appended to the name, giving BLOSUM80 for example where sequences that were more than 80% identical were clustered. Scores within a BLOSUM are log-odds scores that measure, in an alignment, the logarithm for the ratio of the likelihood of two amino acids appearing with a biological sense and the likelihood of the same amino acids appearing by chance.<ref name=handbook>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=kDFltuQo1dMC&pg=PA673&lpg=PA673&dq=blosum+matrix | title=Handbook of Nature-Inspired And Innovative Computing | isbn=0387405321 | author=Albert Y.

To calculate a BLOSUM matrix, the following equation is used: :<math>S_{ij}= \left( \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)\log{\left( \frac{p_{ij}}{q_i * q_j} \right)}</math> Here, <math>p_{ij}</math> is the probability of two amino acids <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> replacing each other in a homologous sequence, and <math>q_i</math> and <math>q_j</math> are the background probabilities of finding the amino acids <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> in any protein sequence at random. The factor <math>\lambda</math> is a scaling factor, set such that the matrix contains easily computable integer values. An article in Nature Biotechnology<ref>{{cite journal| date=2008| journal=Nat.

The BMF file extension is also used by an architecture design program called '''FloorPlan 3D''' by [http://imsidesign.com/Default.aspx IMSI]. It was developed by CADSOFT Corporation, and the copyright in 1998 by IMSI shows '''FloorPlan 3D''' with a version of 4.10. However, the Corel format was proprietary and, to our knowledge, has never been released publicly. Consequently, very little information exists about the BMF format. As of 2004, per a conversation with Corel's technical support group, Corel had discontinued support for the BMF format (ie, by dropping support for the Clipart Gallery applications which used that format) and had no further plans to support it any subsequent Corel applications.
