for temporal objects, and ‘Meta Types’ for expressing upper ontology. The objects in this group are essentially any thing about which the knowledge engineer intends to express and store in the knowledge base, i.e., they are the objects of discourse. The instances of these component classes can be stored with or without expressing ‘instance of’ or ‘sub-class of’ relations among them. ===Predicates=== This group consists of ‘Relation’, and ‘Relation Type’ for expressing declarative knowledge, and ‘Function’ and ‘Function Type’ for expressing procedural knowledge. This group is to express qualitative and quantitative relations among the various instances stored in the knowledge base. While instantiating the predicates can be characterized by their logical properties of relations, quantifiers and cardinality as monadic predicates of these predicate objects. ===Structures=== ‘System’, ‘Encapsulated Class’, ‘Program’, and ‘Process’, are other base classes for complex structures, which can be combined iteratively to produce more complex systems. The component class ‘System’ is to store in the knowledge base a set of propositions composed into ontologies, axiomatic systems, complex systems like say a human body, an artefact like a vehicle etc., with or without consistency check. An ‘Encapsulated Class’ is to com- pose declarative and behavioural objects in a flexible way to build classes. A ‘Program’ is not only to store the logic of any complete program or a component class, composed from the already available behavioural instances in the knowledge base with built-in connectives (conditions, and loops), but also execute them as web services. A ‘Process’ is to structure temporal objects with sequence, concurrency, synchronous or asynchronous specifications. Every node in the database keeps the neighbourhood information, such as its super-class, sub-class, instance-of, and other relations, in which the object has a role, in the form of predicates. This feature makes computation of drawing graphs and inferences, on the one hand, and dependency and navigation paths on the other hand very easy. All the data and metadata is indexed in a central catalogue making query and locating resources efficient. == References == {{reflist|colwidth=30em}} ==External links== {{Portal|Free software}} * [http://www.gnowledge.org Welcome to Gnowledge!] * [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnowsys GNOWSYS is part of the GNU project.] {{GNU}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Gnowsys}} <!-- Categories --> [[Category:Zope]] [[Category:Free network-related software]] [[Category:Semantic Web]] [[Category:Knowledge representation]] [[Category:GNU Project software]] [[Category:Cross-platform software]] [[fr:GNOWSYS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15457</id> <title>Gnutella</title> <text>{{Dablink|Not to be confused with [[Godzilla]].}} {{Lead too short|date=October 2009}} {{Filesharing}} '''Gnutella''' ({{pronEng|nʌˈtɛlə}} with a silent ''g'', but often {{IPA|/ɡnʌˈtɛlə/}}) is a large [[peer-to-peer network]] which, at the time of its creation, was the first decentralized peer-to-peer network of its kind, leading to other, later networks adopting the model.<ref>{{cite news | last=Kushner | first=David | title=The World's Most Dangerous Geek | date=January 13, 2004 | publisher=Rolling Stone | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938320/the_worlds_most_dangerous_geek}}</ref> It celebrated a [[decade]] of existence on March 14, 2010 and has a user base in the millions for [[peer-to-peer file sharing]].

On March 14, the program was made available for download on Nullsoft's servers. The event was prematurely announced on [[Slashdot]], and thousands downloaded the program that day.<ref>[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/03/14/0949234 Gnutella announcement] March 14, 2000 on [[Slashdot]]</ref><ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/ptech/03/15/gnutella/index.html AOL and Gnutella] March 15, 2000 by [[CNN]]</ref> The [[source code]] was to be released later, under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). The next day, AOL stopped the availability of the program over legal concerns and restrained Nullsoft from doing any further work on the project. This did not stop gnutella; after a few days, the protocol had been [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]], and compatible [[free and open source software|free and open source]] clones began to appear. This parallel development of different clients by different groups remains the ''[[modus operandi]]'' of gnutella development today. The gnutella network is a fully distributed alternative to such semi-centralized systems as [[FastTrack]] ([[KaZaA]]) and the original [[Napster]]. Initial popularity of the network was spurred on by Napster's threatened legal demise in early 2001. This growing surge in popularity revealed the limits of the initial protocol's scalability. In early 2001, variations on the protocol (first implemented in [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[closed source software|closed source]] clients) allowed an improvement in scalability. Instead of treating every user as client and server, some users were now treated as "ultrapeers", routing search requests and responses for users connected to them. This allowed the network to grow in popularity. In late 2001, the gnutella client [[LimeWire|Limewire Basic]] became free and open source. In February 2002, [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]], a commercial file sharing group, abandoned its [[FastTrack]]-based peer-to-peer software and released a new client based on the free and open source gnutella client [[Gnucleus]]. The word "gnutella" today refers not to any one project or piece of software, but to the open protocol used by the various clients. The name is a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of ''[[GNU]]'' and ''[[Nutella]]'', the brand name of a hazelnut flavored spread: supposedly, Frankel and Pepper ate a lot of Nutella working on the original project, and intended to license their finished program under the GNU General Public License. Gnutella is not associated with the [[GNU|GNU project]]<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gnutella.html Regarding Gnutella (www.gnu.org)]</ref> or its own peer-to-peer network, [[GNUnet]]. On October 26, 2010, popular gnutella [[servent]] [[LimeWire]] was ordered shut down by Judge [[Kimba Wood]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] when she signed a Consent Injunction which LimeWire and recording industry plaintiffs had agreed upon. <ref>http://download.limewire.com/injunction/Injunction.pdf</ref> This event may have caused a notable drop
