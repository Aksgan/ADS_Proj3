However, doing so would undesirably alter the structure of the Laplacian and other quantities. ===Stream function formulation=== Taking the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the Navier–Stokes equation results in the elimination of pressure. This is especially easy to see if 2D Cartesian flow is assumed (<math>w = 0</math> and no dependence of anything on ''z''), where the equations reduce to: :<math> \rho \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_x,</math> :<math> \rho \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right) = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_y.</math> Differentiating the first with respect to ''y'', the second with respect to ''x'' and subtracting the resulting equations will eliminate pressure and any [[conservative force]]. Defining the [[stream function]] <math>\psi</math> through :<math>u = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \quad ; \quad v = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}</math> results in mass continuity being unconditionally satisfied (given the stream function is continuous), and then incompressible Newtonian 2D momentum and mass conservation degrade into one equation: :<math>\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) - \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) = \nu \nabla^4 \psi,</math> where <math>\nabla^4</math> is the (2D) [[biharmonic operator]] and <math>\nu</math> is the [[kinematic viscosity]], <math>\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho}</math>. We can also express this compactly using the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]]: :<math>\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial\left(\psi, \nabla^2\psi \right)}{\partial\left(y,x\right)} = \nu \nabla^4 \psi.</math> This single equation together with appropriate boundary conditions describes 2D fluid flow, taking only kinematic viscosity as a parameter. Note that the equation for [[creeping flow]] results when the left side is assumed zero. In [[axisymmetric]] flow another stream function formulation, called the [[Stokes stream function]], can be used to describe the velocity components of an incompressible flow with one [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function. ==Compressible flow of Newtonian fluids== There are some phenomena that are closely linked with fluid [[compressibility]]. One of the obvious examples is [[sound]]. Description of such phenomena requires more general presentation of the Navier–Stokes equation that takes into account fluid compressibility. If viscosity is assumed a constant, one additional term appears, as shown here:<ref>Landau & Lifshitz (1987) pp. 44–45.</ref><ref>Batchelor (1967) pp. 147 & 154.</ref> :<math>\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \left( \tfrac13 \mu + \mu^v) \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \right) + \mathbf{f} </math> where <math>\mu^v</math> is the [[volume viscosity]] coefficient, also known as ''second viscosity coefficient'' or ''bulk viscosity''. This additional term disappears for an ''incompressible fluid'', when the [[divergence]] of the flow equals zero. ==Application to specific problems== The Navier–Stokes equations, even when written explicitly for specific fluids, are rather generic in nature and their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse. This is partly because there is an enormous variety of problems that may be modeled, ranging from as simple as the distribution of static pressure to as complicated as multiphase flow driven by [[surface tension]]. Generally, application to specific problems begins with some flow assumptions and initial/boundary condition formulation, this may be followed by [[Scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] to further simplify the problem. For example, after assuming steady, parallel, one dimensional, nonconvective pressure driven flow between parallel plates, the resulting scaled (dimensionless) [[boundary value problem]] is: [[Image:NSConvection.png|thumb|400px|Visualization of a) parallel flow and b) radial flow.]] :<math>\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = -1 \quad ; \quad u(0) = u(1) = 0.</math> The boundary condition is the [[no slip condition]]. This problem is easily solved for the flow field: :<math>u(y) = \frac{y - y^2}{2}.</math> From this point onward more quantities of interest can be easily obtained, such as viscous drag force or net flow rate. Difficulties may arise when the problem becomes slightly more complicated. A seemingly modest twist on the parallel flow above would be the ''radial'' flow between parallel plates; this involves convection and thus nonlinearity. The velocity field may be represented by a function <math>f(z)</math> that must satisfy: :<math>\frac{d^2 f}{d z^2} + R f^2 = -1 \quad ; \quad f(-1) = f(1) = 0.</math> This [[ordinary differential equation]] is what is obtained when the Navier–Stokes equations are written and the flow assumptions applied (additionally, the pressure gradient is solved for). The [[nonlinear]] term makes this a very difficult problem to solve analytically (a lengthy [[Implicit function|implicit]] solution may be found which involves [[elliptic integrals]] and [[Cubic formula|roots of cubic polynomials]]). Issues with the actual existence of solutions arise for R > 1.41 (approximately. This is not the square root of two), the parameter R being the [[Reynolds number]] with appropriately chosen scales. This is an example of flow assumptions losing their applicability, and an example of the difficulty in "high" Reynolds number flows. ===Exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations=== Some exact solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations exist. Examples of degenerate cases — with the non-linear terms in the Navier–Stokes equations equal to zero — are [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation|Poiseuille flow]], [[Couette flow]] and the oscillatory [[Stokes boundary layer]]. But also more interesting examples, solutions to the full non-linear equations, exist; for example the [[Taylor–Green vortex]].<ref>{{citation | journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics | volume=23 | pages=159–177 | year=1991 | doi=10.1146/annurev.fl.23.010191.001111 | title=Exact solutions of the steady-state Navier–Stokes equations | first=C.Y. | last=Wang }}</ref><ref> Landau &
