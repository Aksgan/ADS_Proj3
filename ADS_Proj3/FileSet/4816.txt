===Windows Me=== {{main|Windows Me}} In September 2000, Microsoft introduced Windows Me (Millennium Edition), which upgraded Windows 98 with enhanced multimedia and Internet features. It also introduced the first version of [[system restore]], which allowed users to revert their system state to a previous "known-good" point in the case of system failure. The first version of [[Windows Movie Maker]] was introduced as well. Windows Me was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available from the [[Windows Update|Windows Update site]] as updates for older Windows versions. As a result, Windows Me was not acknowledged as a unique Operating System along the lines of 95 or 98, and is often included in the Windows 9x series. Windows Me was criticized by users for its instability and unreliability, due to frequent freezes and crashes. A ''PC World'' article dubbed Windows Me the "Mistake Edition" and placed it 4th in their "Worst Tech Products of All Time" feature.<ref name= mistake>{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,125772-page,2/article.html | title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time | author=Dan Tynan | date=26 May 2006 | publisher=PC World | accessdate=2007-08-19 }}</ref> The inability of users to easily boot into MS-DOS mode, as in Windows 95 or 98, led users to quickly learn how to hack their Windows Me installations to provide the needed service.<ref>[http://www.mvps.org/dts/WinME_DOS/Win-ME.htm]</ref> ===Decline=== The release of Windows 2000 marked a shift in the user experience between the Windows 9x series and the Windows NT series. Where NT4 suffered from a lack of USB support, Plug and Play support, and an aging, difficult to use, archaic-looking interface, Windows 2000 had a modern interface, and better USB and plug and play support than any version of Windows 9x. The release of Windows XP signalled a change of direction for Microsoft, bringing the consumer and business Operating Systems together. One by one, support for the Windows 9x series ended, and Microsoft stopped selling the software to end users, then later to OEMs. By March 2004, it was impossible to purchase any copy of any Windows in the 9x series.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/lifecycle/default.mspx Windows life cycle]</ref> ===End of Service life=== Microsoft continued to support the use of the Windows 9x series, however, until July 11, 2006, when extended support ended for the software.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx Windows 9x end of support lifetime.]</ref> Microsoft DirectX, a set of standard gaming APIs, stopped being updated on Windows 95 at Version 8.0a.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4846C891-D45D-4122-8230-69F3E5ECDEDE&displaylang=en]</ref> Windows 98 and ME stopped being updated at version 9, and DirectX 10 ships with and is only available with Windows Vista and later; previous versions of Windows are not able to officially run DirectX 10-exclusive applications. Microsoft [[Internet Explorer 7]], the first major update for the aged and insecure [[Internet Explorer 6]] in half a decade, was only available for Windows XP SP2 or later. The growing number of important updates caused by the end of service life of these pieces of software have slowly made Windows 9x less and less practical for everyday use. Today, even open source projects such as Mozilla won't run on Windows 9x without rework.<ref>[http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?locale=et&comments_parentId=74873&forumId=1 No support for Windows 98 in Mozilla Firefox]</ref> ==Design== ===Kernel=== {{Main|Architecture of Windows 9x}} Windows 9x is a series of hybrid 16/32-bit operating systems. Like most operating systems, Windows 9x consists of [[Kernel (computing)|kernel space]] and [[Userland (computing)|user space]] memory. Although Windows 9x features [[memory protection]], it does not protect the first megabyte of memory from [[Userland (computing)|userland]] applications. This area of memory contains code critical to the functioning of the operating system, and by writing into this area of memory an application can [[Crash (computing)|crash]] or [[Hang (computing)|freeze]] the operating system. This was a source of instability as faulty applications could by accident write into this region and with that halt the operating system.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/expertzone/chats/transcripts/bottchat.mspx Windows XP Chat Transcript]</ref> ====User Mode==== The user-mode parts of Windows 9x consist of three subsystems: the Win16 subsystem, the Win32 subsystem and MS-DOS.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win95/rk31_arc.mspx?mfr=true Windows 95 architecture components]</ref> Windows 9x/Me set aside two blocks of 64 KB memory regions for [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] and heap resources. By running multiple applications, applications with numerous GDI elements or by running applications over a long span of time, it could exhaust these memory areas. If free system resources dropped below 10%, Windows would become unstable and likely crash.<ref>[http://apptools.com/rants/resources.php Resource management under Microsoft Windows]</ref> ====Kernel Mode==== The kernel mode parts consist of the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), the Installable File System Manager ([[IFSHLP.SYS|IFSHLP]]), the Configuration Manager, and in Windows 98 and later, the [[Windows Driver Model|WDM]] Driver Manager (NTKERN).<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win98/reskit/part6/wrkc28.mspx?mfr=true Windows 98 architecture]</ref> As a 32-bit operating system, virtual memory space is 4 [[GiB]], divided into a lower 2 GiB for applications and an upper 2 GiB for kernel per process. ===Registry=== Like Windows NT, Windows 9x stores user-specific and configuration-specific settings in a large information database called the [[Windows registry]]. Hardware-specific settings are also stored in the registry, and many device drivers use the registry to load configuration data. Previous versions of Windows used files such as <tt>[[AUTOEXEC.BAT]]</tt>, <tt>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</tt>, <tt>[[WIN.INI]]</tt>, <tt>[[SYSTEM.INI]]</tt> and other files with an <tt>.INI</tt> extension to maintain configuration settings. As Windows became more complex and incorporated more features, <tt>.INI</tt> files became too unwieldy for the limitations of the then-current FAT filesystem. Backwards-compatibility with <tt>.INI</tt> files was maintained until Windows XP succeeded the 9x and NT lines. Although Microsoft discourages using .INI files in favor of Registry entries, a large number of applications (particularly 16-bit Windows-based applications) still use .INI files. Windows 9x supports .INI files solely for compatibility with those applications and related tools (such as setup programs). The AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files also still exist for compatibility with real-mode system components and to allow users to change certain default system settings such as the PATH environment variable. The registry consists of two files: User.dat and System.dat. In Windows Me, Classes.dat was added. ===Virtual Machine Manager=== The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is the [[32-bit]] [[protected mode]] kernel at the core of Windows 9x. Its primary responsibility is
