KeySearch feature (a menu of [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] links that automatically generates a search without the need to see the key numbers or the terms and connectors query), or * by finding a relevant case using keyword searching and then using the key number hyperlinks in the document to find related cases. Most secondary sources published by Thomson West, such as [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] and [[American Jurisprudence]], also have key number hyperlinks in their on-line Westlaw versions. The "Key Numbers and Digest" feature and the hyperlinks create a "Custom Digest." The Custom Digest allows: * selection of the jurisdiction of interest (so that headnotes from cases in that jurisdiction will appear in the results); * limiting the time frame of the search; and * adding additional search terms. Selecting key numbers and jurisdictions in the "Key Number Search Tool" results in a similar display of digest headnotes. Since all West headnote annotations are merged on Westlaw into a single database from which each Custom Digest is generated, there is no need to consult each separate series of the hard copy Decennial Digest. Full text of the cases may be accessed from the Custom Digest by clicking on the underlined case citation. The key number search or KeySearch will retrieve entire cases from a case law database. == Other digest systems == Other digest systems exist, including Butterworth's Digest[http://rimer.butterworths.co.uk/webcat/enquiry/product/prodInfo.asp?ProdID=460&Text=First&i=cat&Acca=0] for the [[United Kingdom]] (also containing references to cases decided in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), the Canadian Abridgment,[http://www.carswell.com/areasofinterest/law/print/abridgment.htm] digests associated with [[Reporter (law)|official state reports]], such as in [[California]] and [[Wisconsin]], and digests associated with topical reporters, such as the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] Case Digest. Most of these use a topic and section format, while some, like the U.C.C. Case Digest, use a section format based on the statute or rules being annotated. The A.L.R. Digest, accompanying the [[American Law Reports]], formerly had its own classification system, but was replaced in 2004 by ''West's American Law Reports Digest,'' which follows West's topic and key number system. ==See also== * [[Legal research]] * [[Citator]] == External references == *[http://west.thomson.com/documentation/westlaw/wlawdoc/wlres/keynmb06.pdf West Topic & Key Number System - Westlaw Quick Reference Guide](.pdf) * [http://west.thomson.com/store/Results.aspx?n=4294966990&ntt=+key&pagesize=20&no=0&ntk=KEYWORD-SEARCH West product search for Key Number Digest] * [http://west.thomson.com/product/17304137/product.asp ''West's Analysis of American Law'' product description] * [http://west.thomson.com/store/product.asp?product_id=13503637 ''West's A.L.R.

This is useful during [[white box testing]], where a system is examined to make sure that it fulfills its requirements. Having access to the subsystem internals in general makes the subsystem easier to understand, but also easier to [[Hack (technology slang)|hack]]; if a programmer, for example, can examine source code, weaknesses in an algorithm are much easier to discover. This makes white box testing much more effective than [[black box testing]], but considerably more difficult due to the sophistication needed on the part of the tester to understand the subsystem. Also known as '''glass box''', '''clear box''', or '''open box'''. White box also refers to a system that is visible, but which is so complex that it might as well be a [[Black box]].

In a white pages directory, each entry typically represents an individual [[user (computing)|person that makes use of]] network resources, such as by receiving email or having an account to log into a system. In some environments, the schema may also include the representation of organizational divisions, roles, groups, and devices. The term is derived from the [[white pages]], the listing of individuals in a [[telephone directory]], typically sorted by the individual's home location (e.g. city) and then by their name. While many [[PTT|telephone service providers]] have for decades published a list of their [[subscriber]]s in a [[telephone directory]], and similarly corporations published a list of their employees in an internal directory, it was not until the rise of [[electronic mail]] systems
