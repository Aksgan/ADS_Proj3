the treatment room alongside the treatment linear accelerator. The advantage is that the conventional CT provides accurate measure of tissue attenuation, which is important for dose calculation. (e.g. CT on rails) (Dawson & Sharpe 2006) === Cone beam === {{main|Cone beam reconstruction}} [[Cone beam reconstruction|cone-beam]] [[computed tomography]] (CBCT) based image guided systems have been integrated with medical linear accelerators to great success. With improvements in flat-panel technology, CBCT has been able to provide volumetric imaging, and allows for radiographic or fluoroscopic monitoring throughout the treatment process. Cone beam CT acquires many projections over the entire volume of interest in each projection. Using reconstruction strategies pioneered by Feldkamp, the 2D projections are reconstructed into a 3D volume analogous to the CT planning dataset. === MVCT === Megavoltage Computed Tomography is a medical imaging technique that uses the Megavoltage range of X-rays to create an image of bony structures or surrogate structures within the body. The original rational for MVCT was spurred by the need for accurate density estimates for treatment planning. Both patient and target structure localization were secondary uses. A test unit using a single linear detector, consisting of 75 cadmium tunstate crystals, was mounted on the linear accelerator gantry. The test results indicated a spatial resolution of .5m, and a contrast resolution of 5% using this method. While another approach could involve integrating the system directly into the MLA, it would limit the number of revolutions to a number prohibitive to regular use. === Optical Tracking === The use of a camera to relay positional information of objects within its inherent coordinate system by means of a subset of the electromagnetic spectrum of wavelengths spanning ultra-violet, visible, and infrared light. Optical navigation has been in use for the last 10 years within image guided surgery (neurosurgery, ENT, and orthopaedic) and has increased in prevalence within radiotherapy to provide real-time feedback through visual cues on graphical user interfaces (GUIs). For the latter, a method of calibration is used to align the camera’s native coordinate system with that of the isocentric reference frame of the radiation treatment delivery room. Optically tracked tools are then used to identify the positions of patient reference set-up points and these are compared to their location within the planning CT coordinate system. A computation based on least-squares methodology is performed using these two sets of coordinates to determine a treatment couch translation that will result in the alignment of the patient’s planned isocenter with that of the treatment room. These tools can also be used for intrafraction monitoring of patient position by placing an optically tracked tool on a region of interest to either initiate radiation delivery (i.e. gating regimes) or action (i.e. repositioning). == Correction Strategies for patient positioning during IGRT == There are two basic correction strategies used while determining the most beneficial patient position and beam structure: on-line and off-line correction. Both serve their purposes in the clinical setting, and have their own merits. Generally, a combination of the both strategies is employed. Often, a patient will receive corrections to their treatment via on-line strategies during their first radiation session, and physicians make subsequent adjustments off-line during check film rounds. (Jaffray et al. 1999) === On-line === The On-line strategy makes adjustment to patient and beam position during the treatment process, based on continuously updated information throughout the procedure. (Dawson & Sharpe 2006) The on-line approach requires a high-level of integration of both software and hardware. The advantage of this strategy is a reduction in both systematic and random errors. An example is the use of a marker-based program in the treatment of prostate cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Gold markers are implanted into the prostate to provide a surrogate position of the gland. Prior to each day’s treatment, portal imaging system results are returned. If the centre of the mass has moved greater than 3mm, then the couch is readjusted and a subsequent reference image is created. ([[David Jaffray|Jaffray]] et al. 1999) === Off-line === The Off-line strategy determines the best patient position through accumulated data gathered during treatment sessions. These strategies utilize sophisticated CT hardware to create future procedures. Additionally, physicians and staff measure the success of treatment, and devise treatment guides during check film rounds using information from the EPIDs. The strategy requires greater coordination of clinic-wide systems than on-line strategies. However, the use of off-line strategies reduces the risk of systematic errors. == Future Areas of Study == *The debate between the benefits of on-line versus off-line strategies continues to be contended. *Whether further research into biological functions and movements can create a better understanding of tumour movement in the body before, between and during treatment. *When rules or algorithms are used, large variations in PTV margins can be reduced. Margin “recipes” are being developed that will create linear equations and algorithms that account for “normal” variations. These rules are created from a normal population, and are applied to the treatment plan off-line. Possible side effects include random errors from uniqueness of the target *With a greater amount of data being collected, how systems must will be established for the categorizing and storing of information. ==See also== *[[Radiation therapy|Radiation Therapy]] *[[CT scanner]] *[[CT-on-Rails/Linac System]] *[[Fluoroscopy]] *[[Medical radiography|Medical Radiography]] *[[Compton effect|Compton scattering]] *[[Cobalt-60]] *[[Cone beam reconstruction|Cone beam Reconstruction]] *[[Positron emission tomography|PET]] *[[MRI]] *[[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements|ICRU]] *[[Cyberknife]] ==External links== *[http://www.radiationatpmh.com/body.php?id=45 Image Guided Radiation Therapy, Radiation Medicine Program, Princess Margaret Hospital] *[http://www.igrt.ca IGRT Education Course, Princess Margaret Hospital] *[http://www.sttarr.ca STTARR] *[http://www.bronnikov-algorithms.com Cone-beam CT (CBCT) with applications in IGRT] *[http://www.medcom-online.de/applications/verisuite/verisuite.htm VeriSuite, Commercial IGRT System for Hadron Therapy] == References == <references/> *Cossmann, Peter H.
