objects that fit a given structure. :{| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="15" | <math>\begin{matrix} (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) \\ (2,1,3) & (2,3,1) \\ (3,1,2) & (3,2,1) \end{matrix}</math> || [[File:Elliptic curve simple.svg|96px]] || [[File:Rubik's cube.svg|96px]] || [[File:Group diagdram D6.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60.svg|96px]] |- | [[Combinatorics]] || [[Number theory]] || [[Group theory]] || [[Graph theory]] || [[Order theory]] |} ===Space===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]] --> The study of space originates with [[geometry]] – in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions; it combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[Vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]] and the controversial [[four color theorem]], whose only proof, by computer, has never been verified by a human. :{| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="15" | [[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|96px]] || [[File:Sine cosine plot.svg|96px]] || [[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Torus.png|96px]] || [[File:Mandel zoom 07 satellite.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Measure illustration.png|70px]] |- |[[Geometry]] || [[Trigonometry]] || [[Differential geometry]] || [[Topology]] || [[Fractal|Fractal geometry]] || [[Measure Theory]] |} ===Change===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]] --> Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior. {| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20" | [[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|96px]] || [[File:Vector field.svg|96px]] || [[File:Airflow-Obstructed-Duct.png|96px]] || [[File:Limitcycle.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Lorenz attractor.svg|96px]] || [[File:Princ argument ex1.png|96px]] |- | [[Calculus]] || [[Vector calculus]]|| [[Differential equation]]s || [[Dynamical system]]s || [[Chaos theory]] || [[Complex analysis]] |} ===Foundations and philosophy=== In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer-Hilbert controversy]]. Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science|theoretical]] [[computer science]]. :{| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="15" | <math> p \Rightarrow q \,</math>|| [[File:Venn A intersect B.svg|128px]] || [[File:Commutative diagram for morphism.svg|96px]] |- | [[Mathematical logic]] || [[Set theory]] || [[Category theory]] || |} ===Theoretical computer science=== [[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most powerful known model – the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with rapid advance of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|P=NP?]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]. :{| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="15" | [[File:DFAexample.svg|96px]] || [[File:Caesar3.svg|96px]] |- | [[Theory of
