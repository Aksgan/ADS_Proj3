Management * [[Change Management (ITSM)]] Within these processes there are a couple of activities concerning security that have to take place. These activities are done as required. The concerning process and its process manager are responsible for these activities. However, the Security Management will give indications to the concerning process on how these (security specific) activities should be structured. == Example == Internal E-mail Policies. The use of internal e-mail in an organization has a lot of security risks. So if an organization chooses to use e-mail as a means of communication, it is highly needed that the organization implements a well thought e-mail security plan/policies. In this example the ITIL security Management approach is used to implement e-mail policies in an organization. First of the Security management team is formed and the guidelines, of how the process should be carried out, are formulated and made clear to all employees and provider concerned. These actions are carried out in the Control phase of the Security Management process. The next step in to process to implement e-mail policies is the Planning. In the Plan phase of the process the policies are formulated. Besides the policies that are already written in the Service Level Agreements the policies that are specific for the e-mail security are formulated and added to the service level agreements. At the end of this phase the entire plan is formulated and is ready to be implemented. The following phase in the process is the actual implementation of the e-mail policies. The implementation is done according to the plan which was formulated in the preceding phase (Plan phase). After the actual implementation the e-mail policies will be evaluated. In order to evaluate the implemented policies the organization will perform; The last phase is the maintenance phase. In the maintenance phase the implemented e-mail policies are maintained. The organization now knows which policies are properly implemented and are properly followed and, which policies need more work in order to help the security plan of the organization and, if there are new policies that have to be implemented. At the end of this process the Request for change are formulated (if needed) and the e-mail policies are properly maintained. In order for the organization to keep its security plan up-to-date the organization will have to perform the security management process continuously. There is no end to this process an organization can always better its security. <!-- Image has been removed. Reference needs to be removed as well.

The collection encompasses over 3000 pages, including the introduction and catalogs. It serves as the basis for the [[IT baseline protection]] [[certification]] of an [[business|enterprise]]. == Basic protection == IT baseline protection (protection) encompasses standard security measures for typical IT systems, with normal protection needs.<ref>IT Basic Protection Manual, sec. 1.1</ref> The detection and assessment of weak points in IT systems often occurs by way of a [[risk assessment]], wherein a [[threat potential]] is assessed, and the costs of damage to the system (or group of similar systems) are investigated individually. This approach is very time-intensive and very expensive. Protection may rather proceed from a typical threat, which applies to 80% of cases, and recommend adequate countermeasures against it. In this way, a security level can be achieved, viewed as adequate in most cases, and, consequently, replace the more expensive risk assessment. In cases in which security needs are greater, such protection can be used as a basis for further action. == The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs layout == [[Image:Aufbau BSI Grundschutzkataloge.jpg|thumb|The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs' layout]] To familiarize the user with the manual itself, it contains an introduction with explanations, the approach to IT baseline protection, a series of concept and role definitions, and a glossary. The component catalogs, threat catalogs, and the measures catalogs follow these introductory sections. Forms and cross-reference tables supplement the collection available on the Federal Office for Security in Information Technology's (BSI) Internet platform. Here you can also find the Baseline Protection Guide, containing support functions for implementing IT baseline protection in procedural detail. Each catalog element is identified by an individual mnemonic laid out according to the following scheme (the catalog groups are named first). ''C'' stands for component, ''M'' for measure, and ''T'' for threat. This is followed by the layer number affected by the element. Finally, a serial number within the layer identifies the element. ===Component catalog=== [[Image:Bausteinzuordnung BSI Grundschutzkataloge.jpg|thumb|Assignment of individual components to personnel groups within the respective organization]] The component catalog is the central element, and contains the following five layers: overall aspects, infrastructure, IT systems,
