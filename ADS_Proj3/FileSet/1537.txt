energy consumption == Original PlayStation 3 has a maximum power rating of 380 [[watt]]s (newer versions have a lower rating). As Folding@home is a CPU intensive application, it causes 100% utilization. However, according to Stanford's PS3 FAQ, "We expect the PS3 to use about 200W while running Folding@home."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/FAQ-PS3.html | title = PS3 FAQ | format = FAQ }}</ref> As of December 27, 2008, there are 55,291 PS3s providing 1,559,000,000 MFlops of processing power. This amounts to 28,196 MFlops/PS3, and with Stanford's estimate of 200W per PS3 (for original units manufactured on the 90 nm process), 140.98 MFlops/watt.<ref name="osstats"/> This would put the PS3 portion of Folding@home at 95th on the November 2008 Green500 list.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://green500.org/lists/listdisplay.php?month=11&year=2008&list=green500_200811.csv&start=1&line=101 | title = Lists :: November 2008 :: Ranks 1-100 | work = Green 500 }}</ref> The Cell processors used in 65 nm PlayStation 3s lower power consumption to around 140W per PS3, whilst the 45 nm PS3s reduce this again to around 100W. This further increases the power efficiency of the contribution from PlayStation 3 units. The total power consumption required to produce the processing power required by the project can be estimated based upon the average [[FLOPS per watt]]. As of November 2008, according to the [[Green500]] list, the most efficient computer - also based on a version of the Cell BE - runs at 536.24 MFLOPS/watt.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://green500.org/lists/2008/11/list.php | title = The Green500 List | accessdate = 2008-12-27 }}</ref> One petaFLOPS equals 1,000,000,000 MFLOPSs. Therefore, the current Folding@home project, if it were theoretically using the most efficient [[CPU]]s currently available, would use at least 2.8 [[megawatt]]s of power per petaFLOPS, slightly more than the world's first petaFLOPS system, the Cell-based Roadrunner which uses 2.345MW. This is equivalent to the power needed to light approximately 40,000 standard house light bulbs (between 60 and 100 watts each), or the equivalent of 1-3 [[wind turbine]]s depending on their size.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill#Modern_windmills | title = Windmill - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia }}</ref> Estimates of energy usage per time period are more difficult than estimates of energy usage per processing instruction. This is because Folding@home clients are often run on computers that would be powered-on even in the absence of the Folding@home client, and that run other programs simultaneously. Looking at energy-balance in a larger context requires a number of assumptions. While Folding@home increases processor utilization, and thus (usually) power consumption; the extent to which it does so depends on the client processor's normal operating load, and its ability to reduce clock speeds when presented with less-than-full utilization (a process known as [[dynamic frequency scaling]]). In a Folding@home client that runs in a heated home, the excess heat generated by the power usage would reduce the amount of energy needed to heat the building to some degree. However, such energy gains would be offset over the year in those locations where air-conditioners are employed during the warmer months. == See also == * [[Blue Gene]] * [[Grid computing]] * [[List of distributed computing projects]] * [[List of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Software for molecular modeling]] * [[Molecular modeling on GPU]] * [[Rosetta@home]] ==References== {{reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://folding.stanford.edu/ Folding@home project homepage] *[http://fahwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page Folding@home Wiki] *[http://www.fah-addict.net/ FAH-Addict; Folding@home related news] *[http://kakaostats.com/ Kakao Folding@home Stats] *[http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&teamnum=42223 Wikipedia team] *[http://sites.google.com/site/techtdsn/folding-home 002 Tools F@H Performance Data] site disabled *[http://www.parc.com/event/696/foldinghome.html Talk given by Folding@home author Vijay Pande at the PARC forum] *[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BVNCQt6MJw Folding@home Instructional Video on YouTube] *[http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/1070617 Interview of Vijay Pande about Folding@Home Project] {{DEFAULTSORT:Folding@Home}} [[Category:Protein folds]] [[Category:Protein structure]] [[Category:Distributed computing projects]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Linux science software]] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:PlayStation 3 software]] [[Category:Cross-platform software]] [[ar:فولدينغ@هوم]] [[be:Folding@home]] [[be-x-old:Folding@home]] [[ca:Folding@home]] [[da:Folding@home]] [[de:Folding@home]] [[es:Folding@home]] [[eo:Folding@Home]] [[fr:Folding@home]] [[it:Folding@Home]] [[he:Folding@home]] [[lt:Folding@home]] [[nl:Folding@home]] [[ja:Folding@Home]] [[no:Folding@Home]] [[pl:Folding@home]] [[pt:Folding@home]] [[ru:Folding@home]] [[fi:Folding@home]] [[sv:Folding@home]] [[tr:Folding@Home]] [[uk:Folding@home]] [[vi:Folding@home]] [[zh-yue:Folding@home]] [[zh:Folding@home]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13911</id> <title>Food safety</title> <text>{{Food safety}} '''Food safety'''<ref>[http://factsonfile.infobasepublishing.com/BookSearch.asp?pageID=2&bookType2=H&ISBN=0816069689&searchText=satin&parent=&productType=&sortType=&Filter=Desc Satin, M., ''Food Alert: The Ultimate Sourcebook for Food Safety'', Facts on File, Inc., September 2008, 2nd ed.]</ref> is a scientific discipline describing handling, [[food processing|preparation]], and storage of [[food]] in ways that prevent [[foodborne illness]]. This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe [[health|health hazards]]. [[Food]] can transmit [[disease]] from person to person as well as serve as a growth medium for [[bacterium|bacteria]] that can cause [[food poisoning]]. Debates on genetic food safety include such issues as impact of [[genetically modified food]] on health of further generations and genetic pollution of environment, which can destroy natural biological diversity. In developed countries there are intricate standards for food preparation, whereas in [[lesser developed countries]] the main issue is simply the availability of adequate [[safe water]], which is usually a critical item.<ref>I.
