Such promotions have been done by both individual neuroscientists and large organizations. For example, individual neuroscientists have promoted neuroscience education among young students by organizing the International Brain Bee (IBB), which is an academic competition for high school or secondary school students worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the International Brain Bee|work=The International Brain Bee|url=http://www.internationalbrainbee.com/about_bee.html}}</ref> In the United States, large organizations such as the [[Society for Neuroscience]] have promoted neuroscience education by developing a primer called Brain Facts,<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain Facts: A Primer on the Brain and Nervous System|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=brainfacts}}</ref> collaborating with members of public education{{clarify|date=November 2010}} to develop Neuroscience Core Concepts for K-12 teachers and students,<ref>{{cite web|title=Neuroscience Core Concepts: The Essential Principles of Neuroscience|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=core_concepts}}</ref> and cosponsoring a campaign with the Dana Foundation called Brain Awareness Week to increase public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain Awareness Week Campaign|work=The Dana Foundation|url=http://www.dana.org/brainweek/}}</ref> Finally, neuroscientists have also collaborated with other education experts to study and refine educational techniques to optimize learning among students, an emerging field called [[educational neuroscience]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Goswami U|year=2004|title=Neuroscience, education and special education|journal=Br J of Spec Educ|volume=31|issue=4|language=|pages=175&ndash;183|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00352.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00352.x}}</ref> Federal Agencies in the United States, such as the [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH) and [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), have also funded research that pertain to best practices in teaching and learning of neuroscience concepts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ==See also== {{Portal|Neuroscience}} {{Wikiversity|Topic: Neuroscience}} * * [[List of publications in biology#Neurobiology|Important publications in neuroscience]] * [[List of neuroscience databases]] * [[List of neuroscience topics]] * [[List of neuroscientists]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==Further reading== {{Refbegin|2}} * {{cite book | last = Bear | first = M.
