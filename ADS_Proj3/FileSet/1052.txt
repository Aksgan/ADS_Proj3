is actually a much older form of "demon"; daemons have no particular bias towards good or evil, but rather serve to help define a person's character or personality. The ancient Greeks' concept of a "personal daemon" was similar to the modern concept of a "guardian angel" — ''eudaemonia'' is the state of being helped or protected by a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons. (p.403) </blockquote> A further characterization of the mythological symbolism is that a daemon is something which is not visible yet is always present and working its will. [[Plato]]'s [[Socrates]] describes his own personal daemon to be something like the modern concept of a moral conscience:{{cquote|''The favour of the gods has given me a marvelous gift, which has never left me since my childhood.

This is so it can first be [[compile]]d to ensure that all required dependencies are present, and possibly tested to show no [[computer bug|bugs]] have been introduced. The daily build is also often publicly available allowing access to the latest features for feedback. In this context a ''build'' is the result of [[compiler|compiling]] and [[Linker (computing)|linking]] all the files that make up a [[computer program|program]]. The use of such disciplined procedures as daily builds is particularly necessary in large organizations where many programmers are working on a single piece of software. Performing '''daily builds''' helps ensure that [[Software developer|developers]] can work knowing with reasonable certainty that any new bugs that show up are a result of their own work done within the last day. '''Daily builds''' typically include a set of tests, sometimes called a '''smoke test''' ( as in where there is smoke there is fire). These tests are included to assist in determining what may have been broken by the changes included in the latest build. The critical piece of this process is to include new and revised tests as the project progresses. ==See also== *[[Smoke test#Smoke_testing_in_software_development|Smoke testing in software development]] *[[Tinderbox_%28software%29|[[Mozilla's]] build and smoke test software.]] ==External links== *[http://www.stevemcconnell.com/ieeesoftware/bp04.htm IEEE Best software practices at Steve-McConnell] *[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000023.html Joel-on-software] *[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ daily builds of ubuntu, updated almost everyday], a good example of what a daily build is [[Category:Extreme Programming]] [[Category:Computer programming]] {{soft-eng-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>9138</id> <title>Dailymotion</title> <text>{{Infobox Dotcom company | company_name = Dailymotion | company_logo = [[File:Dailymotion logo.svg|250px]] | company_type = [[Private company|Private]] | foundation = March 15, 2005 | location_city = [[Paris]] | location_country = [[France]] | key_people = Cédric Tournay, CEO<br />Benjamin Bejbaum, Co-founder <br />Olivier Poitrey, CTO<br />Martin Rogard, MD France<br />Joy Marcus, MD US | num_employees = 100 (September 2010) | company_slogan = ''Regarder, publier, partager'' (<small>Watch, publish, share</small>) | url = http://www.dailymotion.com<br />List of domain | screenshot = [[Image:Dailymotion.png|220px]] | caption = The Dailymotion homepage in [[Firefox]] | website_type = [[video sharing]] | advertising = [[Contextual advertising|contextual]] & [[video ads]] | language = [[#International Addresses|19 Countries and 12 languages]] | registration = Optional<br />(required to upload/comment) | launch_date = March 15, 2005 | current_status = Active | alexa = [http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.dailymotion.com 109, 14 in France] }} '''Dailymotion''' is a [[video sharing service]] [[website]], headquartered in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]], [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[France]].<ref>"[http://www.dailymotion.com/us/about About us]."

Dailymotion allows users to browse and upload videos by searching tags, channels or user-created groups; the search system also introduces results based on things other users have searched for. The maximum size of a video file is 2 gigabytes. The length of the video file is also limited to 20 minutes, except for the MotionMakers and the Official Users. Videos uploaded by users to Dailymotion are converted to the [[VP6]] [[codec]] at a resolution of 320×240. Audio on Dailymotion videos is encoded as [[MP3]] at 96 [[kbit/s]] in [[stereo]]. In 2007, Dailymotion signed a major agreement with the [[Canal+]] network to broadcast its television series in full on the site. All Canal+ videos are shown on an encrypted channel of the site with anti-piracy safeguards. Within a year, the site's revenue had increased to €10
