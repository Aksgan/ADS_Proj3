of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the [[Hispanic]] community. [[Social networking]] was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of professional and student chapters throughout the nation.

A year later, it was renamed the American Society of Tool Engineers (ASTE). It finally became the Society of Manufacturing Engineers in 1969. ==Membership== SME [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/getsmepg.pl?/html/chap_region.htm&&&SME& local chapters] and [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/getsmepg.pl?/communities/tcn.htm&&&SME& technical communities] are real-life and virtual venues where members and other manufacturing practitioners can connect and interact, to exchange ideas and information from one peer to another. ==Events== SME's [http://www.biztradeshows.com/organizers/society-manufacturing-engineers.html industry-leading events] keep manufacturers connected — to each other and to the latest manufacturing equipment, production methods and management strategies. ==Publications== SME publishes [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/getsmepg.pl?/gmn/mag/home.html&&&SME&NONAV& Manufacturing Engineering magazine] and [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/getsmepg.pl?/html/yearbooks.htm&&&SME& industry-related yearbook series], several hundred educational [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/getgmnpage.pl?/html/storehome.html&&&SME& books and videos], two [http://www.sciencedirect.com/sme peer-reviewed scholarly journals] and more than 17,000 [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/getsmepg.pl?/html/techpapers.htm&&SME& technical papers]. ==Professional Development== SME's professional development opportunities, available to individuals, companies and educators, provide the right tools and information to help advance careers and drive operations to new levels of productivity and competitiveness. SME offers several industry-standard certifications for professional recognition, and documentation of a member’s manufacturing-related knowledge and skills. These include the [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/certhtml.pl?/cert/cmfgtp.htm&&SME& Certified Manufacturing Technologist (CMfgT)], [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/certhtml.pl?/cert/cmfgep.htm&&SME& Certified Manufacturing Engineering (CMfgE) Certification] and [http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/certhtml.pl?/cert/lean_certification.htm&&SME& Lean Certification].
