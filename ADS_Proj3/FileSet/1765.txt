of goal programming applications in many and diverse fields. Linear Goal programmes can be solved using linear programming software as either a single linear programme, or in the case of the lexicographic variant, a series of connected linear programmes. Goal programming can hence handle relatively large numbers of variables, constraints and objectives. A debated weakness is the ability of goal programming to produce solutions that are not [[Pareto efficient]]. This violates a fundamental concept of [[decision theory]], that is no rational decision maker will knowingly choose a solution that is not Pareto efficient. However, techniques are available <ref name= "Rom"/><ref>EL Hannan (1980) Non-dominance in goal programming, INFOR, 18, 300-309</ref><ref>M Tamiz, SK Mirrazavi, DF Jones (1999) Extensions of Pareto efficiency analysis to integer goal programming, Omega, 27, 179-188.</ref> to detect when this occurs and project the solution onto the Pareto efficient solution in an appropriate manner. The setting of appropriate weights in the goal programming model is another area that has caused debate, with some authors <ref>SI Gass (1987) A process for determining priorities and weights for large scale linear goal programmes, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 37, 779-785.</ref> suggesting the use of the [[Analytic Hierarchy Process]] or interactive methods <ref>BJ White (1996) Developing Products and Their Rhetoric from a Single Hierarchical Model, 1996 Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Society for Technical Communication, 43, 223-224.</ref> for this purpose. == External links == * [http://garbo.uwasa.fi/pub/pc/ts/tslin35c.zip LINSOLVE Free Windows command-line window linear programming and linear goal programming] == References == {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Goal Programming}} [[Category:Mathematical optimization]] [[Category:Operations research]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15502</id> <title>Golden Nugget 64</title> <text>{{Infobox VG | title = Golden Nugget 64 | image = [[Image:goldennugget64.jpg|250px|Golden Nugget 64]] | caption = Cover art of ''Golden Nugget 64'' | developer = [[Westwood Studios]] | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | series = ''Golden Nugget'' | released = {{vgrelease|NA=December 08, 1998}} | genre = [[Casino game|Casino]] | modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]] <br> [[Multiplayer game|Multiplayer]] | ratings = {{vgratings|ESRB=Everyone (E)}} | platforms = [[Nintendo 64]] | media = [[ROM cartridge|Cartridge]] | distribution=[[Digital media|Physical]], [[Digital distribution|download]] }} '''''Golden Nugget 64''''' is a multi-player virtual [[casino game|casino]] video game for the [[Nintendo 64]].
