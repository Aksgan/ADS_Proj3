of the localization of mental functions in the [[brain]]. Gall was born in [[Baden]], in the village of [[Tiefenbronn]] to a wealthy [[Roman Catholic]] wool merchant. The Galls had been the leading family in the area for over a century. As the second eldest son, he was intended for the priesthood but chose instead to study medicine at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. He later completed his degree in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Around 1800, he developed "[[cranioscopy]]", a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. Cranioscopy («''cranium''»: skull, «''scopos''»: vision) was later renamed to [[phrenology]] («''phren''»: mind, «''logos''»: study) by his follower [[Johann Spurzheim]]. Gall's concepts on brain localization were revolutionary, and caused religious leaders and some scientists to take exception. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] considered his theory as contrary to [[religion]] (that the mind, created by God, should have a physical seat in brain matter was [[anathema]]). Established science also condemned these ideas for lack of [[scientific proof]] of his theory. His ideas were also not acceptable to the court of Franz Josef II (the brother of Marie Antoinette). Due to this opposition, Gall left his lecturer position in Austria. He sought a teaching position in Germany and eventually settled in Paris. Revolutionary France was most likely the most hospitable place for Gall's theories. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the ruling [[emperor]], and the scientific establishment led by the [[Institute of France]], pronounced his science as invalid. Despite all this, Gall was able to secure a comfortable existence on the basis of his speciality. Gall became a celebrity of sorts as he was accepted into Parisian intellectual salons. Gall's phrenological theories and practices were best accepted in England, where the ruling class used it to justify the "inferiority" of its colonial subjects. It also became very popular in the USA from 1820 to 1850. The misuse of Gall's ideas and work to justify discrimination were deliberately furthered by his associates, including [[Johann Spurzheim]]. Later, others tried to improve on his theories with systems such as [[characterology]]. In spite of the many problems associated with his work, Gall made significant contributions to neurological science. In 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Gall died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married he had no direct descendent. However, direct descendants of his brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A collection of his skulls can be seen at the Rollet Museum in Baden bei Wien, Austria, where several of his relatives now live (http://www.bmi.gv.at/oeffentlsicherheit/2006/09_10/Seinerzeit.pdf). Gall's theories had an influence both on the Italian criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]] and on his French rival, [[Alexandre Lacassagne]]. ==External links== *[http://www.historyofphrenology.org.uk/ The History of Phrenology on the Web] by John van Wyhe, PhD. {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Gall, Franz Joseph | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 9 March 1758 | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Baden]] | DATE OF DEATH = 22 August 1828 | PLACE OF DEATH = [[Paris]] }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Gall, Franz Joseph}} [[Category:1758 births]] [[Category:1828 deaths]] [[Category:People from Enzkreis]] [[Category:German Roman Catholics]] [[Category:German neuroscientists]] [[Category:History of neuroscience]] [[Category:Phrenologists]] [[Category:Philosophers of mind]] [[Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] [[bg:Франц Йозеф Гал]] [[de:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[et:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[es:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[fr:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[it:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[lb:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[hu:Franz Gall]] [[nl:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[ja:フランツ・ガル]] [[no:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[pl:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[pt:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[ru:Галль, Франц Иосиф]] [[fi:Franz Joseph Gall]] [[sv:Franz Joseph Gall]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14155</id> <title>Fred Fish</title> <text>{{Other persons|Frederick Fish}} {{ infobox person | name = Fred Fish | image = Fish-Compton-Haynie.jpg | caption = Fred Fish, Jason Compton, and [[Dave Haynie]] in 1995 | birth_date = {{birth date|1952|11|04}} | death_date = {{death date and age|2007|04|20|1952|11|04}} | known_for = Fish Disks }} [[Image:Amiga koln.jpg|thumb|Image taken at the first Amiga show in Cologne (Köln).]] '''Fred Fish''' (November 4, 1952 &ndash; April 20, 2007) was a [[computer programmer]] notable for work on the [[GNU Debugger]] and his series of Fish disks of [[freeware]] for the [[Amiga]]. He was a pioneering spirit pervasive in the Amiga community. The Fish Disks (term coined by [[Perry Kivolowitz]] at a Jersey Amiga User Group meeting) became the first national rallying point, a sort of early postal system. Fish would get his disks off around the world in time for regional and local user group meetings who in turn duplicated them for local consumption. Typically, only the cost of materials changed hands. The Fish Disk series ran from 1986 to 1994. In it, one can chart the growing sophistication of Amiga software and see the emergence of many software trends. The Fish Disks were distributed at computer stores and Commodore Amiga enthusiast clubs. Contributors submitted applications and source code and the best of these each month were assembled and released as a diskette. Since the Internet was not yet in popular usage outside military and university circles, this was a primary way for enthusiasts to share work and ideas.<ref name = "Fish Disks">[http://www.amiga-stuff.com/pd/fish.html Fish] disks, Amiga Stuff.</ref> He also initiated the "GeekGadgets" project, a GNU standard environment for [[AmigaOS]] and [[BeOS]].

He used to live in Phoenix with his wife, until he lived his dream of living aboard a boat. He and his wife lived the sea life with their two dogs. Living space was small, and they were cut off from most things. When they decided their two year boat crusade was done, they lived Michelle's dream of living in a "cabin" like home. They moved to Idaho. Fred Fish died at his home in Idaho on Friday April 20, 2007 of a heart
