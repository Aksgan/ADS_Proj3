error correction|Reed–Solomon code]], fewer than 1 in 40,000 erroneous frames can escape detection. * All frames not employing the Reed–Solomon code use a [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) error-detecting code, which has an undetected frame-error rate of less than 1 in 32,000. == Example: Radio & TV Broadcasting == === MPEG packetized stream === '''Packetized Elementary Stream (PES)''' is a [[specification]] defined by the [[MPEG]] [[communication protocol]] (see the [[MPEG-2]] standard) that allows an [[elementary stream]] to be divided into packets. The elementary stream is packetized by encapsulating sequential data bytes from the elementary stream inside PES packet headers. A typical method of transmitting elementary stream data from a video or audio encoder is to first create PES packets from the elementary stream data and then to encapsulate these PES packets inside an [[MPEG transport stream]] (TS) packets or an [[MPEG program stream]] (PS). The TS packets can then be [[multiplexed]] and transmitted using broadcasting techniques, such as those used in an [[ATSC tuner|ATSC]] and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]. ==== PES packet header ==== {|class="wikitable" !Name!!Size!!Description |- |Packet start code prefix||3 bytes||0x000001 |- |Stream id||1 byte||Examples: Audio streams (0xC0-0xDF), Video streams (0xE0-0xEF) <ref>http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/a001r7.tm1214r30.dTS101154.v1.8.1.pdf</ref> <ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1827030.html Method and apparatus for changing codec to reproduce video and/or audio data streams encoded by different codecs within a channel - Patent EP1827030<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.epo.org/patents/patent-information/european-patent-documents/publication-server.html?iAction=3&cc=EP&pn=1827030&ki=A2 European publication server<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>https://publications.european-patent-office.org/PublicationServer/document.jsp?PN=EP1827030%20EP%201827030&iDocId=6296342&iFormat=0</ref> |- | || ||Note: The above 4 bytes is called the 32 bit [[start code]]. |- |PES Packet length||2 bytes||Can be zero as in not specified for video streams in [[MPEG transport stream]]s |- |Optional PES header||variable length|| |- |Stuffing bytes||variable length|| |- |Data|| ||See [[elementary stream]].

This means that the [[Frequency modulation|FM]] or [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] regular mono sound carrier is left alone for reception by monaural receivers. A NICAM-based stereo-TV infrastructure can transmit a stereo TV programme as well as the mono "compatibility" sound at the same time, or can transmit two or three entirely different sound streams. This latter mode could be used to transmit audio in different languages, in a similar manner to that used for [[in-flight movie]]s on international flights. In this mode, the user can select which soundtrack to listen to when watching the content by operating a "sound-select" control on the receiver. [[Image:NICAM-spectrum.png|600px]] NICAM offers the following possibilities. The mode is auto-selected by the inclusion of a 3-bit type field in the data-stream * One digital stereo sound channel. * Two completely different digital mono sound channels. * One digital mono sound channel and a 352 kbit/s data channel. * One 704 kbit/s data channel. The four other options could be implemented at a later date. Only the first two of the ones listed are known to be in general use however. '''NICAM packet transmission''' The NICAM packet (except for the header) is scrambled with a nine-bit pseudo-random bit-generator before transmission. * The topology of this pseudo-random generator yields a bitstream with a repetition period of 511 bits. * The pseudo-random generator's polynomial is: '''x^9 + x^4 + 1'''. * The pseudo-random generator is initialized with: '''111111111'''. Making the NICAM bitstream look more like [[white noise]] is important because this reduces signal patterning on adjacent TV channels. * The NICAM header is not subject to scrambling. This is necessary so as to aid in locking on to the NICAM data stream and resynchronisation of the data stream at the receiver. * At the start of each NICAM packet the pseudo-random bit generator's shift-register is reset to all-ones. ==See also== *[[Statistical multiplexing]] *[[Anti-replay]] *[[Packet sniffer]] *[[Gigapackets]] *[[Mangled packet]] *[[TCP segment]] *[[TCP/IP]] *[[DHCP server]] *[[Packet generation model]] *[[Louis Pouzin]] * [[Tail drop]] ==References== <references /> *Dean, Tamara (2006).
