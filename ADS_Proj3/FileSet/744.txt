through NLP ([[natural language processing]]) algorithms that interrogate segments of text for possible alternatives such as word order, spacing and hyphenation. NLP can also be used to identify sentence structure and categorize text strings according to grammar (for example, categorizing a string of text as a [[noun]] based on a preceding string of text known to be an [[Article (grammar)|article]]). Graphic representation of co-occurrence networks allow them to be visualized and inferences drawn regarding relationships between entities in the [[domain]] represented by the dictionary of terms applied to the text corpus. Meaningful visualization normally requires simplifications of the network. For example, networks may be drawn such that the number of neighbors connecting to each term is limited. The criteria for limiting neighbors might be based on the absolute number of co-occurrences or more subtle criteria such as “probability” of co-occurrence or the presence of an intervening descriptive term. Quantitative aspects of the underlying structure of a co-occurrence network might also be informative, such as the overall number of connections between entities, clustering of entities representing sub-domains, detecting synonyms<ref>Cohen AM, Hersh WR, Dubay C, Spackman, K: “Using co-occurrence network structure to extract synonymous gene and protein names from MEDLINE abstracts” BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:103</ref>, etc. Some working applications of the co-occurrence approach are available to the public through the internet. [[PubGene]] is an example of an application that addresses the interests of biomedical community by presenting networks based on the co-occurrence of genetics related terms as these appear in [[MEDLINE]] records<ref>Jenssen TK, Laegreid A, Komorowski J, Hovig E: "A literature network of human genes for high-throughput analysis of gene expression. " Nature Genetics, 2001 May; 28(1):21-8. PMID: 11326270</ref><ref>Grivell L: “Mining the bibliome: searching for a needle in a haystack? New computing tools are needed to effectively scan the growing amount of scientific literature for useful information.” EMBO reports 2001 Mar;3(3):200-3: PMID: 11882534</ref>. The web site [http://www.namebase.org/ Name Base] is an example of how human relationships can be inferred by examining networks constructed from the co-occurrence of personal names in newspapers and other texts (as in Ozgur et al.<ref>Ozgur A, Cetin B, Bingol H: “Co-occurrence Network of Reuters News” (15 Dec 2007) http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2491</ref>). Networks of information are also used to facilitate efforts to organize and focus publicly available information for law enforcement and intelligence purposes (so called "[[open source intelligence]]" or OSINT). Related techniques include co-citation networks as well as the analysis of hyperlink and content structure on the internet (such as in the analysis of web sites connected to terrorism<ref>Zhou Y, Reid E, Qin J, Chen H, Lai G: "US Domestic Extremist Groups on the Web: Link and Content Analysis" http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2005.96</ref>).

When an application frees memory, gaps can fall in the [[memory segment]] that the application uses. Among other techniques, coalescing is used to reduce [[Fragmentation (computer)|external fragmentation]], but is not totally effective. Coalescing can be done as soon as blocks are freed, or it can be deferred until some time later (known as deferred coalescing), or it might not be done at all. Coalescence and related techniques like heap compaction, can be used in [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. ==External links== http://www.memorymanagement.org/articles/alloc.html [[Category:Garbage collection (computer science)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6628</id> <title>Coarse function</title> <text>{{One source|date=July 2010}} In mathematics, '''coarse functions''' are [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] that may appear to be continuous at a distance, but in reality are not necessarily continuous.<ref name="coarsepdf">Chul-Woo Lee and Jared Duke (2007), [http://www.rose-hulman.edu/mathjournal/archives/2007/vol8-n2/paper4/v8n2-4pd.pdf Coarse Function Value Theorems].
