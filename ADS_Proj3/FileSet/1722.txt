Department of Defense (USDOD) is the steward of GPS. ''Interagency GPS Executive Board (IGEB)'' oversaw GPS policy matters from 1996 to 2004. After that the ''[[National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Executive Committee]]'' was established by presidential directive in 2004 to advise and coordinate federal departments and agencies on matters concerning the GPS and related systems. The executive committee is chaired jointly by the deputy secretaries of defense and transportation. Its membership includes equivalent-level officials from the departments of state, commerce, and homeland security, the joint chiefs of staff, and NASA. Components of the executive office of the president participate as observers to the executive committee, and the FCC chairman participates as a liaison. USDOD is required by law to "maintain a Standard Positioning Service (as defined in the federal radio navigation plan and the standard positioning service signal specification) that will be available on a continuous, worldwide basis," and "develop measures to prevent hostile use of GPS and its augmentations without unduly disrupting or degrading civilian uses." === Timeline and modernization === {| class="wikitable" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em" |+ Summary of satellites<ref>[http://www.insidegnss.com/node/918 GPS Wing Reaches GPS III IBR Milestone] in InsideGNSS November 10, 2008</ref> ! rowspan="2" | Block || rowspan="2" | Launch <br />Period || colspan="4" | Satellite launches || rowspan="2" | Currently in orbit<br /> and healthy |- !
