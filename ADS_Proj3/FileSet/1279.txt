amounts. A programmed EPROM retains its data for about ten to twenty years <ref> * [[Paul Horowitz]] and Winfield Hill, ''The Art of Electronics 2nd Ed. '' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989 ISBN 0521370957 page 817 </ref> and can be read an unlimited number of times. The erasing window must be kept covered with an opaque label to prevent accidental erasure by sunlight. Old PC [[BIOS]] chips were often EPROMs, and the erasing window was often covered with a label containing the BIOS publisher's name, the [[BIOS]] revision, and a copyright notice. The practice of covering the BIOS chip with a label is still commonly seen as of today, even though current BIOS chips are actually EEPROMs or NOR flashes, with no erase windows. Erasure of the EPROM begins to occur with wavelengths shorter than 400 [[Nanometre|nm]]. Exposure time for sunlight of 1 week or 3 years for room fluorescent lighting may cause erasure. The recommended erasure procedure is exposure to UV light at 253.7 nm of at least 15 W-sec/cm2 for 20 to 30 minutes, with the lamp at a distance of about 1 inch. Erasure can also be accomplished with [[X-ray]]s: :"Erasure, however, has to be accomplished by non-electrical methods, since the gate electrode is not accessible electrically. Shining ultraviolet light on any part of an unpackaged device causes a photocurrent to flow from the floating gate back to the silicon substrate, thereby discharging the gate to its initial, uncharged condition. This method of erasure allows complete testing and correction of a complex memory array before the package is finally sealed. Once the package is sealed, information can still be erased by exposing it to X radiation in excess of 5*10<sup>4</sup> [[Rad (unit)|rad]]s, a dose which is easily attained with commercial X-ray generators." (5*10<sup>4</sup> [[Rad (unit)|rad]] = 500 [[Joule|J]]/kg)<ref>May 10, 1971 issue of [[Electronics (magazine)|Electronics Magazine]] in an article written by Dov Frohman</ref> "In other words, to erase your EPROM you would first have to X-ray it and then put it in an oven at about 600 degrees Celsius (to anneal semiconductor alterations caused by the x-rays). The effects of this process on the reliability of the part would have required extensive testing so they decided on the window instead."<ref name="jmargolin_com-eprom">{{cite web|title=eprom|url=http://www.jmargolin.com/patents/eprom.htm}} 090508 jmargolin.com</ref> (any temperature between 450 - 1410 °C should work). EPROMs had a limited but large number of erase cycles; the silicon dioxide around the gates would accumulate damage from each cycle, making the chip unreliable after several thousand cycles. EPROM programming is slow compared to other forms of memory. Because higher-density parts have little exposed oxide between the layers of interconnects and gate, ultraviolet erasing becomes less practical for very large memories. Even dust inside the package can prevent some cells from being erased. <ref> Sah 1991 page 640 </ref> ==Application== For large volumes of parts (thousands of pieces or more), mask-programmed ROMs are the lowest cost devices to produce. However, these require many weeks lead time to make, since the artwork for an IC mask layer must be altered to store data on the ROMs. Initially, it was thought that the EPROM would be too expensive for mass production use and that it would be confined to development only. It was soon found that small-volume production was economical with EPROM parts, particularly when the advantage of rapid upgrades of firmware was considered. Some [[microcontrollers]], from before the era of [[EEPROM]]s and [[flash memory]], use an on-chip EPROM to store their program. Such microcontrollers include some versions of the [[Intel 8048]], the [[Freescale 68HC11]], and the "C" versions of the [[PIC microcontroller]]. Like EPROM chips, such microcontrollers came in windowed (expensive) versions that were useful for debugging and program development. The same chip came in (somewhat cheaper) opaque OTP packages for production. Leaving the die of such a chip exposed to light can also change behavior in unexpected ways when moving from a windowed part used for development to a non-windowed part for production. ==EPROM sizes and types== EPROMs come in several sizes both in physical packaging as well and storage capacity. While parts of the same type number from different manufacturers are compatible as long as they're only being read, there are subtle differences in the programming process. Most EPROMS could be identified by the programmer through "signature mode" by forcing 12V on pin A9 and reading out two bytes of data. However, as this was not universal, programmer software also would allow manual setting of the manufacturer and device type of the chip to ensure proper programming.<ref name = "Silicon Signature"> {{Cite book | editor = U.S. International Trade Commission | title = Certain EPROM, EEPROM, Flash Memory and Flash Microcontroller Semiconductor Devices and Products Containing Same, Inv. 337-TA-395 | publisher = Diane Publishing | date = October 1998 | pages = 51–72 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=fkd0fwh9N2UC&pg=PA51 | isbn = 1428957219}} The details of SEEQ's Silicon Signature method of a device programmer reading an EPROM's ID.</ref> {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |- !
