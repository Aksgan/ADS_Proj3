It is named after [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Voronoi]], also called a '''Voronoi [[tessellation]]''', a '''Voronoi decomposition''', or a '''Dirichlet tessellation''' (after [[Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Lejeune Dirichlet]]), In the simplest case, we are given a set of points ''S'' in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site ''s'' has a Voronoi cell, also called a Dirichlet cell, ''V(s)'' consisting of all points closer to ''s'' than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites. ==Definition== Let ''S'' be a set of points in [[Euclidean space]] with all [[limit point]]s contained in ''S''. [[Almost everywhere|For almost every point]] ''x'' in the Euclidean space, there is one point of ''S'' closest to ''x''. The word "almost" is used to indicate exceptions where a point ''x'' may be equally close to two or more points of ''S''. If ''S'' contains only two points, ''a'' and ''b'', then the set of all points equidistant from ''a'' and ''b'' is a [[hyperplane]]â€”an [[Affine space|affine]] subspace of [[codimension]] 1. That hyperplane is the boundary between the set of all points closer to ''a'' than to ''b'', and the set of all points closer to ''b'' than to ''a''. It is the perpendicular [[bisection|bisector]] of the line segment from ''a'' to ''b''. In general, the set of all points closer to a point ''c'' of ''S'' than to any other point of ''S'' is the interior of a (in some cases unbounded) convex [[polytope]] called the '''Dirichlet domain''' or '''Voronoi cell''' for ''c''. The set of such polytopes [[tessellation|tessellates]] the whole space, and is the '''Voronoi tessellation''' corresponding to the set ''S''. If the dimension of the space is only 2, then it is easy to draw pictures of Voronoi tessellations, and in that case they are sometimes called '''Voronoi diagrams'''. ==Properties== * The [[dual graph]] for a Voronoi diagram corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points ''S''. * The [[closest pair of points]] corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram. * Two points are adjacent on the [[convex hull]] if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side. ==History== Informal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to [[Descartes]] in 1644. [[Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Dirichlet]] used 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850. British physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|Soho cholera epidemic]] lived closer to the infected [[Soho#Broad_Street_pump|Broad Street pump]] than to any other water pump. Voronoi diagrams are named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Fedoseevich Voronoi]] (or ''Voronoy'') who defined and studied the general ''n''-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]] to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called '''Thiessen polygons''' after American meteorologist [[Alfred H. Thiessen]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], such tessellations are also known as [[Wigner-Seitz unit cell]]s. Voronoi tessellations of the [[reciprocal lattice]] of [[momentum|momenta]] are called [[Brillouin zone]]s. For general lattices in [[Lie group]]s, the cells are simply called [[fundamental domain]]s. In the case of general [[metric space]]s, the cells are often called metric [[fundamental polygon]]s. == Examples == [[Image:Coloured Voronoi 3D slice.png|right|thumb|This is a slice of the Voronoi diagram of a random set of points in a 3D box. In general a cross section of a 3D Voronoi tessellation is not a 2D Voronoi tessellation itself. (The cells are all [[Convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].)]] Voronoi tessellations of regular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations. * A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares) * A 3D cubic lattice gives the [[cubic honeycomb]] * Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each others' centers give the [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]] * Certain body centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with [[rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron|rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra]] * A [[face-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]] * A [[body-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[truncated octahedron|truncated octahedra]] For the set of points (''x'', ''y'') with ''x'' in a discrete set ''X'' and ''y'' in a discrete set ''Y'', we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers. == Higher-order Voronoi diagrams == {{Expand section|date=June 2009}} {{cleanup|section|date=August 2009}} Although a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the
