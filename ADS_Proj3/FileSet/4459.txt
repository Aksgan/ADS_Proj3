over all ''N'' atomic sites. The Bloch wave is an exact eigensolution for the wave function of an electron in a periodic crystal potential corresponding to an energy ''E''<sub>m</sub> ('''''k'''''), and is spread over the entire crystal volume. Using the [[Fourier transform]] analysis, a spatially localized wave function for the ''m''-th energy band can be derived from this Bloch wave: :<math>a_m\mathbf{(R_n,r)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{\mathbf{k}}{e^{\mathbf{-ik\cdot R_n}}\psi_m\mathbf{(k,r)}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{\mathbf{k}}{e^{\mathbf{ik\cdot (r-R_n)}}u_m\mathbf{(k,r)}}.</math> These real space wave functions <math>{a_m\mathbf{(R_n,r)}}</math> are called [[Wannier function]]s, and are fairly closely localized to the atomic site '''''R'''''<sub>n</sub>. Of course, if we have exact [[Wannier function]]s, the exact Bloch functions can be derived using the inverse Fourier transform. However it is not easy to calculate directly either [[Bloch wave|Bloch functions]] or [[Wannier function]]s. An approximate approach is necessary in the calculation of [[electronic structure]]s of solids. If we consider the extreme case of isolated atoms, the Wannier function would become an isolated atomic orbital. That limit suggests the choice of an atomic wave function as an approximate form for the Wannier function, the so-called tight binding approximation. ==Second quantization== Modern explanations of electronic structure like [[t-J model]] and [[Hubbard model]] are based on tight binding model.<ref name=Altland>{{cite book |title=Condensed Matter Field Theory |author=Alexander Altland and Ben Simons |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=58 ''ff'' |chapter=Interaction effects in the tight-binding system |isbn=9780521845083 |year=2006 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0KMkfAMe3JkC&pg=RA4-PA58}}</ref> If we introduce [[second quantization]] formalism, it is clear to understand the concept of tight binding model. Using the atomic orbital as a basis state, we can establish the second quantization Hamiltonian operator in tight binding model. : <math> H = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle,\sigma}( c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} c^{}_{j,\sigma}+ h.c.)</math>, : <math> c^\dagger_{i\sigma} , c_{j\sigma}</math> - creation and annihilation operators : <math>\displaystyle\sigma</math> - spin polarization : <math>\displaystyle t</math> - hopping integral : <math>\displaystyle \langle i,j \rangle </math> -nearest neighbor index Here, hopping integral <math>\displaystyle t</math> corresponds to the transfer integral <math>\displaystyle\gamma</math> in tight binding model. Considering extreme cases of <math>t\rightarrow 0</math>, it is impossible for electron to hop into neighboring sites. This case is the isolated atomic system. If the hopping term is turned on (<math>\displaystyle t>0</math>) electrons can stay in both sites lowering their [[kinetic energy]]. In the strongly correlated electron system, it is necessary to consider the electron-electron interaction. This term can be written in :<math>\displaystyle H_{ee}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n,m,\sigma}\langle n_1 m_1, n_2 m_2|\frac{e^2}{|r_1-r_2|}|n_3 m_3, n_4 m_4\rangle c^\dagger_{n_1 m_1 \sigma_1}c^\dagger_{n_2 m_2 \sigma_2}c_{n_4 m_4 \sigma_2} c_{n_3 m_3 \sigma_1}</math> This interaction Hamiltonian includes direct [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] interaction energy and exchange interaction energy between electrons. There are several novel physics induced from this electron-electron interaction energy, such as [[metal-insulator transition]]s (MIT), [[high-temperature superconductivity]], and several [[quantum phase transition]]s. ==Example: one-dimensional s-band== Here the tight binding model is illustrated with a '''s-band model''' for a string of atoms with a single [[Cubic_harmonic#The_s-orbitals|s-orbital]] in a straight line with spacing ''a'' and [[Sigma bond|σ bonds]] between atomic sites. To find approximate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, we can use a linear combination of the atomic orbitals : <math>|k\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n=1}^N e^{inka} |n\rangle </math> where ''N'' = total number of sites and <math>k</math> is a real parameter with <math>-\frac{\pi}{a}\leqq k\leqq\frac{\pi}{a}</math>. (This wave function is normalized to unity by the leading factor 1/√N provided overlap of atomic wave functions is ignored.) Assuming only nearest neighbor overlap, the only non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian can be expressed as :<math> \langle n|H|n\rangle= E_0 = E_i - U \ .</math> :<math> \langle n\pm 1|H|n\rangle=-\Delta \ </math> :<math> \langle n|n\rangle= 1 \ ;</math> &ensp; <math>\langle n \pm 1|n\rangle= S \ .</math> The energy ''E''<sub>i</sub> is the ionization energy corresponding to the chosen atomic orbital and ''U'' is the energy shift of the orbital as a result of the potential of neighboring atoms. The <math> \langle n\pm 1|H|n\rangle=-\Delta </math> elements, which are the [[#Table_of_interatomic_matrix_elements|Slater and Koster interatomic matrix elements]], are the [[Chemical bond|bond energies]] <math>E_{i,j}</math>. In this one dimensional s-band model we only have <math>\sigma</math>-bonds between the s-orbitals with bond energy <math>E_{s,s} = V_{ss\sigma}</math>. The overlap between states on neighboring atoms is ''S''. We can derive the energy of the state <math>|k\rangle</math> using the above equation: : <math> H|k\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_n e^{inka} H |n\rangle </math> : <math> \langle k| H|k\rangle =\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n,\ m} e^{i(n-m)ka} \langle m|H|n\rangle </math>&ensp;<math>=\frac{1}{N}\sum_n \langle n|H|n\rangle+\frac{1}{N}\sum_n \langle n-1|H|n\rangle e^{+ika}+\frac{1}{N}\sum_n\langle n+1|H|n\rangle e^{-ika}</math>&ensp;<math>= E_0 -2\Delta\,\cos(ka)\ ,</math> where, for example, :<math> \frac{1}{N}\sum_n \langle n|H|n\rangle = E_0 \frac{1}{N}\sum_n 1 = E_0 \ , </math> and :<math>\frac{1}{N}\sum_n \langle n-1|H|n\rangle e^{+ika}=-\Delta e^{ika}\frac{1}{N}\sum_n 1 = -\Delta e^{ika} \ .</math> :<math>\frac{1}{N}\sum_n \langle n-1|n\rangle e^{+ika}= S e^{ika}\frac{1}{N}\sum_n 1 = S e^{ika} \ .</math> Thus the energy of this state <math>|k\rangle</math> can be represented in the familiar form of the energy dispersion: :<math> E(k)= \frac{E_0-2\Delta\,\cos(ka)}{1 + 2 S\,\cos(ka)}</math>. *For <math>k = 0</math> the energy is <math>E = (E_0 - 2 \Delta)/ (1 + 2 S)</math> and the state consists of a sum of all atomic orbitals. This state can be viewed as a chain of [[Molecular orbital|bonding orbitals]]. *For <math>k = \pi / (2 a)</math> the energy is <math>E = E_0</math> and the state consists of a sum of atomic orbitals which are a factor <math>e^{i \pi / 2}</math> out of phase. This state can be viewed as a chain of [[Non-bonding orbital|non-bonding orbitals]]. *Finally for <math>k = \pi / a</math> the energy is <math>E = (E_0 + 2 \Delta) / (1 - 2 S)</math> and the state consists of an alternating sum of atomic orbitals. This state can be viewed as a chain of [[Antibonding|anti-bonding orbitals]]. This example is readily extended to three dimensions, for example, to a body-centered cubic or face-centered cubic lattice by introducing the nearest neighbor vector locations in place of simply ''n a''.<ref name= Mott> {{cite book |title= The theory of the properties of metals and alloys |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LIPsUaTqUXUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA58,M1 |author=Sir Nevill F Mott & H Jones |year= 1958 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=048660456X |edition=Reprint of Clarendon Press (1936) |chapter=II §4 Motion of electrons in a periodic field |pages=56 ''ff''}}</ref> Likewise, the method can be extended to multiple bands using multiple different atomic orbitals at each site.
