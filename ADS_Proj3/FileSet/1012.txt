and proper detailing. Aluminum frames are generally painted or [[anodising|anodized]]. Factory applied fluoropolymer thermoset coatings have good resistance to environmental degradation and require only periodic cleaning. Recoating with an air-dry fluoropolymer coating is possible but requires special surface preparation and is not as durable as the baked-on original coating. Anodized aluminum frames cannot be "re-anodized" in place, but can be cleaned and protected by proprietary clear coatings to improve appearance and durability. Exposed glazing seals and gaskets require inspection and maintenance to minimize water penetration, and to limit exposure of frame seals and insulating glass seals to wetting. ==See also== * [[Mullion wall]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}} ==External links== {{Commonscat|Curtain walls}} *[http://www.emrtc.nmt.edu/services/curtainwall.php Curtain Wall Testing] [[Category:Walls]] [[Category:Building engineering]] [[Category:Construction]] [[de:Vorhangfassade]] [[es:Muro cortina]] [[fr:Mur-rideau]] [[it:Curtain wall]] [[ja:カーテンウォール]] [[pl:Ściana kurtynowa]] [[sk:Zavesená fasáda]] [[sv:Curtain wall]] [[ta:திரைச் சுவர்]] [[zh:幕墙]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8741</id> <title>Customer Service Excellence</title> <text>The '''Customer Service Excellence''', (previously the "'''Charter Mark'''") is an accreditation for organisations and an independent validation of achievement. ==History== The Charter Mark was an award demonstrating the achievement of ''national standard for excellence in customer service'' in [[United Kingdom]] [[public sector]] organisations. Introduced in 1991, it was replaced in 2008 by Customer Service Excellence standard, with the last issued Charter Marks expiring in 2011. The Charter Mark was one of the consequences of a political initiative, the [[Citizen's Charter]], by [[Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] in 1991, to improve the face of government. In 2005, the system was reviewed, and it was recommended the scheme be replaced. Accordingly, the Customer Service Excellence standard was launched, and a phased transfer was initiated. Applications for Charter Marks were officially closed on 30 June 2008, with the official final validity date becoming 30 June 2011<ref>[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/chartermark/new_standard.aspx Cabinet Office FAQ page] Accessed 5 September 2008</ref>. ==Recipients== The scope of public sector organisations includes departments of local councils, voluntary organisations having more than 10% public funding, and also private subcontractors on public contracts. It also includes public transport operators and the gas, electricity and water utilities. A number of [[Park and Ride bus services in the United Kingdom|Park and Ride bus schemes]] gained Charter Marks, displaying the mark on their [[bus]]es<ref>[http://stevemaskell.fotopic.net/p49117085.html Fotopic image of an Ipswich Park and Ride bus prominently displaying the Charter Mark]</ref>. ==Assessment== Assessment for the award, made by one of four certification bodies, is on achievement of goals to: # Set standards and perform well # Actively engage with customers, partners and staff # Be fair and accessible to everyone and promote choice # Continuously develop and improve # Use resources effectively and imaginatively # Contribute to improving opportunities and quality of life in the communities served On receipt, an award was valid for three years, after which the organisation must re-apply. ==See also== *[[Artsmark]] *[[Sportsmark]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.cse.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/homeCSE.do?

(2003) "the purpose of a cutaway drawing is to allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering".<ref name="DWE03"> J.

The goal of this drawings in studies can be to identify common design patterns for particular vehicle classes. Thus, the accuracy of most of these drawings, while not 100 percent, is certainly high enough for this purpose.<ref>Mark D. Sensmeier, and Jamshid A. Samareh (2003).

It has also been incorporated into the [[user interface]] of some [[video game]]s.

This cutaway view originates in the early fifteenth century notebooks of [[Taccola|Marino Taccola]] (1382 – 1453). In the 16th century cutaway views in definite form were used in [[Georgius Agricola]]'s (1494-1555) mining book ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' to illustrate underground operations. <ref>Eugene S. Ferguson (1999). ''Engineering and the Mind's Eye''. p.82.</ref> The 1556 book is a complete and systematic treatise on [[mining]] and [[metallurgy#Extractive metallurgy|extractive metallurgy]], illustrated with many fine and interesting [[woodcut]]s which illustrate every conceivable process to extract ores from the ground and metal from the ore, and more besides. It shows the many [[watermill]]s used in [[mining]], such as the machine for lifting men and material into and out of a mine shaft, see image. The term "Cutaway drawing" was already in use in the 19th century but, became popular in the 1930s. == Technique == The location and shape
