the [[History of science|history]], [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]], and [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] and it triggered an ongoing worldwide assessment and reaction in — and beyond — those scholarly communities. In this work Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in science. Scientific progress had been seen primarily as a continuous increase in a set of accepted facts and theories. In this work Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which, periods of such conceptual continuity, which he called “Normal Science,” were interrupted by periods of Revolutionary Science. During Revolutionary Science a change in deep concepts resulted in a new set of defining problems for the science, the temporary sacrifice of some explanatory power of the old concepts, and, most radically, a process of adoption that, instead of being a rational comparison of the set of solved vs. unsolved problems, was a mix of gestalt shift, practitioner succession, and enthusiasm for new problems. For example, Kuhn’s analysis of the Copernican Revolution emphasized that, in its beginning, it did not offer more accurate predictions of celestial events, such as planetary positions, than the Ptolemaic system, but instead appealed to some practitioners based on a promise of better, simpler, solutions that might be developed at some point in the future. Kuhn’s called the core concepts of an ascendant revolution, its “paradigms” and thereby launched this word into widespread analogical use in the second half of the 20th century. Kuhn’s insistence that paradigm shift was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise, but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his work. For some commentators it introduced a realistic humanism into the core of science while for others the nobility of science was tarnished by Kuhn's introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its greatest achievements. ==History== The work was first published as a [[monograph]] in the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'', then as a book by [[University of Chicago Press]] in 1962. (All page numbers below refer to the third edition of the text, published in 1996). In 1969, Kuhn added a postscript to the book in which he replied to critical responses to the first edition of the book. Kuhn dated the genesis of his book to 1947, when he was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] and had been asked to teach a [[science]] class for humanities undergraduates with a focus on historical case studies. Kuhn later commented that until then, "I'd never read an old document in science." [[Aristotle]]'s ''Physics'' was astonishingly unlike [[Isaac Newton]]'s work in its concepts of matter and motion. Kuhn concluded that Aristotle's concepts were not "bad Newton," just different. ==Synopsis== ===Basic approach=== Kuhn's approach to the [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]] has been described as focusing on conceptual issues: what sorts of ideas were thinkable at a particular time? What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing modern modes of thought to historical actors, Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities. Such an approach is largely commensurate with the general historical school of [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|non-linear history]]. ===Historical examples=== Kuhn explains his ideas using examples taken from the [[history of science]]. For instance, at a particular stage in the [[history of chemistry]], some chemists began to explore the idea of [[atomism]]. When many substances are heated they have a tendency to decompose into their constituent elements, and often (though not invariably) these elements can be observed to combine only in set proportions. At one time, a combination of [[water]] and [[alcohol]] was generally classified as a ''compound''. Nowadays it is considered to be a ''solution'', but there was no reason then to suspect that it was not a compound. Water and alcohol would not separate spontaneously, but they could be [[distillation|separated when heated]]. Water and alcohol can be [[miscibility|combined in any proportion]]. A chemist favoring [[atomic theory]] would have viewed all compounds whose elements combine in fixed proportions as exhibiting normal behavior, and all known exceptions to this pattern would be regarded as anomalies whose behavior would probably be explained at some time in the future. On the other hand, if a chemist believed that theories of the atomicity of matter were erroneous, then all compounds whose elements combined in fixed proportions would be regarded as anomalies whose behavior would probably be explained at some time in the future, and all those compounds whose elements are capable of combining in any ratio would be seen as exhibiting the normal behavior of compounds. Nowadays the consensus is that the atomists' view was correct. But if one were to restrict oneself to thinking about chemistry using only the knowledge available at the time, either point of view would be defensible. ===The Copernican Revolution=== {{main|Copernican Revolution}} What is arguably the most famous example of a revolution in scientific thought is the [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|Copernican Revolution]]. In [[Ptolemy]]'s school of thought, [[Deferent and epicycle|cycles and epicycles]] (with some additional concepts) were used for modeling the movements of the [[planet]]s in a cosmos that had a stationary Earth at its center. As accuracy of celestial observations increased, complexity of the Ptolemaic cyclical and epicyclical mechanisms had to increase to maintain the calculated planetary positions close to the observed positions. [[Copernicus]] proposed a cosmology in which the [[Sun]] was at the center and the [[Earth]] was one of the planets revolving around it. For modeling the planetary motions, Copernicus used the tools he was familiar with, namely the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic toolbox. But Copernicus' model needed more cycles and epicycles than existed in the then-current Ptolemaic model, and due to a lack of accuracy in calculations, Copernicus's model did not appear to provide more accurate predictions
