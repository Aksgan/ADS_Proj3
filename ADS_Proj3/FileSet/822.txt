provides inventory and asset management scans/database, package deployment, distributed script execution, and via plugins permissions management and other configuration management functions. Here is a [http://ocsinventory.sourceforge.net/uploads/images/poster-eng.png good diagram] of its architecture. ;[http://opensymbolic.org/ OpenSymbolic] :OpenSymbolic is an OpenSource Enterprise Platform designed to build, configure and manage your huge and global distributed data centers. Based on the best open source frameworks for these purposes, represents the state-of-the-art solution for a centralized datacenter management platforms. ;[[opsi (open pc server integration)]] :opsi (open pc server integration) is a [[desktop management]] software for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] clients based on [[Linux]] servers. It provides automatic [[software deployment]] (distribution), [[unattended installation|unattended OS-Installation]], [[patch]] management, hard- and software inventory, License Management / [[Software Asset Management]] as well as administrative tasks for the [[configuration management]]<ref>http://www.opsi.org/features/</ref>. ;[http://code.google.com/p/pacha Pacha] :Pacha was designed to be a simple way to backup and manage software configuration files from single or multiple server instances across the network.Written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], the initial approach is to easily deploy an instance and capture any changes via a version control ([[mercurial]]), giving the System Administrator the ability to rollback and safe guard valid, working configurations. ;[[Pallet (software)|Pallet]] :Pallet is a provisioning, configuration and management tool written in [[Clojure]]. It uses configuration "crates", that can be functionally composed to configure machines. It requires neither a server, nor an agent on the managed machine. ;[http://info.enstb.org/projets/pcfengine/en/index.html PCfengine] :This tool aim to be a better [[Cfengine]] written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. It uses Python directly as a language to describe configuration files. In contrast to Cfengine, it determines automatically the order in which actions are applied in the client. You can read about its [http://enstb.org/~cguychard/pcfengine/pdf/concepts.pdf concepts] and [http://enstb.org/~cguychard/pcfengine/pdf/api.pdf api]. ;[[PIKT]] :PIKT is foremost a monitoring system that also does configuration management. "''PIKT consists of a sophisticated, [[feature-rich]] file preprocessor; an innovative scripting language with unique labor-saving features; a flexible, centrally directed process scheduler; a customizing file installer; a collection of powerful command-line extensions; and other useful tools.''" [http://pikt.org/] ;[[Puppet (software)|Puppet]] :Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system configuration, distributed using the clientâ€“server paradigm (using [[XML-RPC]] protocol in older versions, with a recent switch to [[Representational State Transfer|REST]]), and a library to realize the configuration. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages. There is support in Puppet for using a pure Ruby DSL as an alternative configuration language in version 2.6.0 and later. ;[[Quattor]] :"''The quattor information model is based on the distinction between the desired state and the actual state. The desired state is registered in a fabric-wide Configuration Database (CDB), using a specially designed configuration language for expressing and validating configurations, composed out of reusable hierarchical building blocks called templates. Configurations are propagated to and cached on the managed nodes.''" [http://quattor.web.cern.ch/quattor/] ;[[Radmind]] :Radmind manages hosts configuration at the file system level. In a similar way to [[Tripwire (software)|Tripwire]] (and other configuration management tools), it can detect external changes to managed configuration, and can optionally reverse the changes. Radmind does not have higher-level configuration element (services, packages) abstraction. A graphical interface is available (only) for [[Mac OS X]]. ;[[SmartFrog]] :Java-based tool to deploy and configure applications distributed across multiple machines. There is no central server; you can deploy a .SF configuration file to any node and have it distributed to peer nodes according to the distribution information contained inside the deployment descriptor itself. ;[[Spacewalk (software)|Spacewalk]] :Spacewalk is an open source Linux and Solaris systems management solution and is the upstream project for the source of Red Hat Network Satellite. Spacewalk works with RHEL, Fedora, and other RHEL derivative distributions like CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc. We are working on getting it packaged for inclusion in Fedora. It allows you to inventory your systems (hardware and software information, install and update software on your systems, collect and distribute your custom software packages into manageable groups, provision your systems (from bare metal via KOAN and cobbler), manage and deploy configuration files to your systems, monitor your systems, provision virtual guests, start/stop/configure virtual guests and delegate all of these actions to organisations with fine grain local or LDAP user controls and system entitlements. ;[http://staf.sourceforge.net STAF] :"''The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) is an open source, multi-platform, multi-language framework designed around the idea of reusable components, called services (such as process invocation, resource management, logging, and monitoring).''" [http://staf.sourceforge.net] There are STAF plugins to perform a variety of common configuration management functions, such as distributed scheduling, execution, and file copying. ;[http://www.heiho.net/synctool/ Synctool] :Python based command line tool that uses SSH with host-based authentication and rsync to copy an overlay tree to a machine or group of machines. Synctool is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. Default behaviour is to show a preview of what files would be updated on which machine; then the admin can either view the changes in more detail or deploy them. Synctool was created by [[Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam|SARA]] system expert Walter de Jong. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} [[Webmin]] - Should also be added to the software covered above. ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Comparison Of Open Source Configuration Management Software}} [[Category:Configuration management| ]] [[Category:Software comparisons|Open source configuration management software]] [[Category:Free software lists and comparisons|Configuration management software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7214</id> <title>Comparison of optimization software</title> <text>{{context|date=October 2010}} {{lead too short|date=October 2010}} The following tables provide a comparison of optimization software libraries, either specialized or general purpose libraries with significant optimization coverage. {| class="wikitable sortable" style="font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto;" |- ! style="width: 12em"| !
