Graham Award}}</ref> is an award given annually by the [[University of Waterloo]] and the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics]] to 'recognize the leadership and many innovative contributions made to the [[University of Waterloo]], and to the Canadian computer industry.' The medal was established in 1994 to recognized Canadian computer industry veteran J. Wesley Graham and his many innovative contributions during his academic career. Recipients are graduates of the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics]] from business, education, or government chosen as exemplifying the many positive qualities Wes Graham demonstrated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/~jwgraham/jwgoc.html |title=James Wesley Graham biography}}</ref> during his career.

It is under constant development by a community of open source developers led by [[Paul Davis (programmer)|Paul Davis]] (who won an Open Source Award in 2004 for this work<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5136755.html |title=Open Source Awards 2004: Paul Davis for JACK| publisher=techrepublic.com.com| accessdate=16 February 2010 }}</ref>) and has been a key piece of infrastructure and the de-facto standard for professional audio software on Linux since its inception in 2002. The server is [[FLOSS|free software]], licensed under the [[GNU GPL]], while the library is licensed under the more permissive [[GNU LGPL]]. == Implementations == JACK can use [[ALSA (Linux)|ALSA]], [[PortAudio]], [[CoreAudio]], [[FreeBoB]], [[FFADO]] and [[Open Sound System|OSS]] as hardware back-ends. Additionally, a dummy driver (useful if no sound output is desired, e.g. for offline rendering) and an Audio-over-UDP driver exist. It runs on [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]] and [[NetBSD]]. The JACK API is standardized by consensus, and two compatible implementations exist: jack1, which is implemented in plain C and has been in maintenance mode for a while, and jack2 (originally jackdmp), a re-implementation in C++ led by Stéphane Letz, which is under aggressive development and has introduced multi-processor scalability and support for operating systems other than Linux.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lad.linuxaudio.org/events/2009_cdm/Thursday/01_Letz/index.html |title=What's new in JACK2? - Linux Audio Conference 2009 paper by primary JACK2 author Stephane Letz |publisher=linuxaudio.org |accessdate=17 February 2010 }}</ref> == Low latency scheduling == The scheduling requirements of JACK to achieve sufficiently low latencies have been one of the driving forces behind the [[Real-time operating system|real-time]] optimization effort for the current [[Linux kernel|Linux 2.6 kernel series]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/9/138 |title=Original annoucement of a voluntary pre-emption patch for the Linux 2.6 kernel series by Ingo Molnar, 2004|publisher=lkml.org |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lwn.net/images/conf/rtlws11/papers/proc/p02.pdf |title=Finding Origins of Latencies Using Ftrace, paper by Steven Rostedt from the Real-time Workshop 2009 |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> whose initial latency performance had been disappointing compared to the older 2.4 series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lac.zkm.de/2006/papers/lac2006_lee_revell.pdf |title=Real-time audio vs. 2.6, Linux Audio Conference 2006 paper by Lee Revell |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> Real-time tuning work has culminated in numerous scheduling improvements to the mainline kernel and the creation of an -rt branch for more intrusive optimizations in the release 2.6.24, and later the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT patch.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/ | title = Real-Time Linux Wiki | publisher = [[kernel.org|Linux Kernel Organization]] | accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> == Applications with JACK support == See [[:Category:Audio software with JACK support]]. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[LADSPA]] * [[Free audio software]] * [[PulseAudio]] * [[aRts]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://jackaudio.org/ Official Website] * [http://jackaudio.org/documentation JACK Documentation] * [http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8354 Linux Journal article] * [http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jackdmp.html Jackdmp with links to OSX and Windows binaries] * [http://apps.linuxaudio.org/apps/categories/jack List of JACK enabled applications] * [http://w3.linux-magazine.com/issue/67/JACK_Audio_Server.pdf Another article on JACK (PDF only)] [[Category:Free audio software]] [[Category:Application programming interfaces]]
