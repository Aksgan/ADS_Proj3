own tests; he said that survivor bias would winnow out the typical failed experiments, but encourage the lucky successes to continue testing. He thought that the common [[null hypothesis]] (of no result) wouldn't be reported, but: : "Eventually, one experimenter remains whose subject has made high scores for six or seven successive sessions. Neither experimenter nor subject is aware of the other ninety-nine projects, and so both have a strong delusion that ESP is operating." He concludes: : "The experimenter writes an enthusiastic paper, sends it to Rhine who publishes it in his magazine, and the readers are greatly impressed". If enough [[scientist]]s study a phenomenon, some will find [[statistically significant]] results by chance, and these are the experiments submitted for publication. To combat this, some editors now call for the submission of 'negative' scientific findings, where "nothing happened."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Survivorship bias is one of the issues discussed in the provocative 2005 paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False."<ref>http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 Ioannidis JPA (2005) Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.

An underlying assumption of SSR is that students learn to read by reading constantly. Successful models of SSR typically allow students to select their own books and require neither testing for comprehension nor book reports. Schools have implemented SSR under a variety of catchy names, such as '''Drop Everything and Read (DEAR)''' or '''Free Uninterrupted Reading (FUR)'''. Other acronyms for Sustained Silent Reading such as '''"Eager And Great Learning Experience (EAGLE)"; "Totally Uninterrupted Reading Beats Other-Stuff (TURBO)"; "Begin Excellent Awesome Reading (Bear)"; "Smart, Happy, Articulate Reading Kids (SHARK) and "Uninterrupted, Non-Stop, Individual, Concentration On Reading Now (UNICORN)"'''were developed by '''Matthew Hong''' and '''Mark Kuhl'''. These acronyms were developed for today's students because DEAR and USSR are outdated and do not grab male students' attention. ==Value of Sustained silent reading== ===Advocates' perspective=== According to advocates, SSR has been shown to lead to gains in several literacy domains, especially comprehension. Advocates also point out that students in SSR programs have more positive attitudes toward reading than students who do not participate in SSR programs. ===National Reading Panel analysis of sustained silent reading studies=== {{Weasel|date=March 2009}} The [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) in the United States meta-analyzed all quasi-experimental and experimental studies of SSR and challenged the claim that SSR has positive effects. The panel stated that the literature contained insufficient numbers of quasi-experimental or experimental studies on SSR to validate its use as a sound educational practice. The panel also noted that the absence of quantitative evidence was not evidence against the practice in itself. They recommended further study of SSR. The NRP's finding was somewhat contentious. Some advocates of SSR claimed the panel had ignored non-experimental findings favoring SSR. Moreover, some critics of the NRP suggested that the panel had worded its commentary on SSR to throw the practice into disfavor even though they admitted little evidence against the practice. ==Sustained silent reading practices== A range of practices have been associated with SSR, and some advocates suggest that teacher models of reading behavior (i.e., teachers read while the students read), a long term commitment to SSR, availability of multiple level, high interest texts, and a sense of reading community are particularly relevant. ==Free voluntary reading (FVR)== '''Free voluntary reading''' ('''FVR''') or '''recreation reading''', related to the [[comprehension hypothesis]], is an educational theory that says many student gains in reading can be encouraged by giving them time to read what they want without too many evaluative measures. Sustained silent reading is a method of implementing recreational and FVR theory. ==In popular culture== *DEAR and SSR play a cameo role in the [[Ramona Quimby]] series of children's books by [[Beverly Cleary]], in which young Ramona uses her assignment as an excuse not to talk to an annoying younger child. ==See also== * [[Extensive reading]] ==External links== *[http://www.sdkrashen.com/articles/pac5/all.html "Free Voluntary Reading: New Research, Applications, and Controversies" by Stephen Krashen] [[Category:Learning]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36282</id> <title>Swarm robotics</title> <text>[[File:RechargingSwarm.jpg|thumb|right|Swarm of open-source Jasmine micro-robots recharging themselves]] [[Image:IRobot Create team.jpg|thumb|right|team of [[iRobot Create]] robots at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]]] '''Swarm robotics''' is a new approach to the coordination of [[multirobot system]]s which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical [[robot]]s. It is supposed that a desired [[collective behavior]] emerges from the interactions between the robots and interactions of robots with [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]]. This approach emerged on the field of artificial swarm intelligence, as well as the biological studies of insects, ants and other fields in nature, where [[swarm behaviour]] occurs. == Definition == The research of swarm robotics is to study the design of robots, their physical body and their controlling [[behavior]]s. It is inspired but not limited by the [[emergent behavior]] observed in [[social insect]]s, called [[swarm intelligence]]. Relatively simple individual rules can produce a large set of complex [[swarm behavior]]s. A key-component is the communication between the members of the group that build a system of constant feedback. The swarm behavior involves constant change of individuals in cooperation with others, as well as the behavior of the whole group. Unlike [[distributed robotic system]]s in general, swarm robotics emphasizes a ''large'' number of robots, and promotes [[scalability]], for instance by using only local communication. That local communication for example can be achieved by [[wireless]] transmission systems, like [[radio frequency]] or [[infrared]]. [[Video tracking]] is an essential tool for systematically studying swarm-behavior, even though other tracking methods are available. Recently [[Bristol robotics laboratory]] developed an ultrasonic position tracking system for swarm research purposes. Further research is needed to find methodologies that allow the design and reliable
