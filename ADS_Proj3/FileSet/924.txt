''f'' from [[natural numbers]] to natural numbers with the property that ''f''(''n'') can be constructed from ''n'' by a [[Turing machine]] in the time of order ''f''(''n''). ==Time Constructible Definitions== There are two different definitions of a time-constructible function. In the first definition, a function ''f'' is called '''time-constructible''' if there exists a positive integer ''n''<sub>0</sub> and Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, stops after exactly ''f''(''n'') steps for all ''n'' ≥ ''n''<sub>0</sub>. In the second definition, a function ''f'' is called '''time-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup>, outputs the binary representation of ''f''(''n'') in ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) time (a unary representation may be used instead, since the two can be interconverted in ''O''(''f''(''n'')) time). There is also a notion of a fully time-constructable function. A function ''f'' is called '''fully time-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, stops after exactly ''f''(''n'') steps. This definition is slightly less general then the first two but, for most applications, either any definition can be used. ==Space Constructible Definitions== Similarly, a function ''f'' is '''space-constructible''' if there exists a positive integer ''n''<sub>0</sub> and a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, halts after using exactly ''f''(''n'') cells for all ''n'' ≥ ''n''<sub>0</sub>. Equivalently, a function ''f'' is '''space-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, outputs the binary (or unary) representation of ''f''(''n''), while using only ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) space. Also, a function ''f'' is '''fully space-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, halts after using exactly ''f''(''n'') cells. ==Examples== All the commonly used functions ''f''(''n'') (such as ''n'', ''n<sup>k</sup>'', 2<sup>''n''</sup>) are time- and space-constructible, as long as ''f''(''n'') is at least ''cn'' for a constant ''c'' > 0. No function which is ''[[little-o notation|o]]''(''n'') can be time-constructible unless it is eventually constant, since there is insufficient time to read the entire input. However, ''log''(''n'') is a space-constructible function. ==Applications== Time-constructible functions are used in complexity theory results such as the [[time hierarchy theorem]]. They are important because the time hierarchy theorem relies on Turing machines that must determine in ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) time whether an algorithm has taken more than ''f''(''n'') steps. This is, of course, impossible without being able to calculate ''f''(''n'') in that time. Such results are typically true for all natural functions ''f'' but not necessarily true for artificially constructed ''f''. To formulate them precisely, it is necessary to have a precise definition for ''a natural function f'' for which the theorem is true. Time-constructible functions are often used to provide such definition. Space-constructible functions are used similarly, for example in the [[space hierarchy theorem]]. {{planetmath|id=3461|title=constructible}} [[Category:Computational complexity theory]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7875</id> <title>Construction Industry Council</title> <text>{{Infobox Company |name = The Construction Industry Council |logo = <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cic_logo.gif]] --> |type = Limited company, not for profit |foundation = 1988 |location_city = London |location_country = UK |location = <!--modifies "Headquarters" entry--> |locations = <!--# of locations--> |key_people = Gordon Masterton OBE, Chairman<br>Keith Clarke, Deputy Chairman<br>Graham Watts OBE, Chief Executive |area_served = |industry = |products = |services = |revenue = |operating_income = |net_income = |num_employees = 18 |parent = |divisions = |subsid = |slogan = |homepage = [http://www.cic.org.uk www.cic.org.uk] |dissolved = |footnotes = |intl = ''yes'' <!--Enter ''yes'' to change labels to international instead of US terminology--> }} The '''Construction Industry Council''' (CIC) is the representative body for the professional bodies, research organizations and specialist business associations in the [[construction industry]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was formed in 1988 as the ''Building Industry Council'' and changed its name in April 1990. ==Activities== The Construction Industry Council aims to provide a single voice for professionals in all sectors of the built environment in the UK through its collective membership of 500,000 individual construction professionals and 25,000 firms of construction [[consultants]]. As representative of the views of professionals, it has a seat on the government/industry body, the [[Strategic Forum for Construction]]. The Construction Industry Council also represents the views of the higher level of the industry (professional, managerial and technical) in [[ConstructionSkills]], the [[Sector Skills Councils|Sector Skills Council]] for construction. ConstructionSkills is a partnership between CIC, [[CITB-ConstructionSkills]] and [[CITB Northern Ireland]]. The Construction Industry Council developed and operates the [[Design Quality Indicator]] ([[DQI]]) tool to measure the design quality of buildings. ==Organisation== The Construction Industry Council's work is managed on a day-to day basis by a small secretariat which works under the direction of the Chief Executive who is responsible to the Council. The Executive Board acts as the main policy and strategy vehicle of the Council. ==Chairmen== Chairmen of the Construction Industry Council and their terms of office: *Sir [[Edmund Happold]]: 1988-1991 *Sir Ian Dixon CBE: 1991-1994 *Robin Wilson CBE: 1994-1996 *Christopher Vickers CBE: 1996-1998 *Robin Nicholson CBE: 1998-2000 *[[Michael Dickson (engineer)|Michael Dickson]] CBE: 2000-2002 *Turlogh O’Brien CBE: 2002-2004 *Stuart Henderson: 2004-2006 *The Rt Hon [[Nick Raynsford]] MP: 2006-2008 *[[WS Atkins PLC|Keith Clarke]]: 2008-2010<ref>[http://www.cic.org.uk/newsevents/PRNewChairmanfortheConstructionIndustryCouncil.pdf CIC appoints Keith Clarke as new Chairman, 11 June 2008]</ref> *Gordon Masterton OBE: 2010-2012<ref>[http://www.cic.org.uk/newsevents/PR-NewChairmanCIC.pdf New Chairman for the Construction Industry Council, 10 June 2010]</ref> ==Membership== The Construction Industry Council has three categories of membership: Full; Associate; and Affiliate Members.
