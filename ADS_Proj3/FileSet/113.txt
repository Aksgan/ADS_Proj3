A large group of selected Photoshop users were invited to beta test in mid-February 2010. ==Version history== {{main|Adobe Photoshop release history}} ==Language availabilities== Photoshop is available in the following languages: Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian.<ref name=PhotoshopLanguages>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/languages/ |title=language versions &#124; Adobe Photoshop CS5 |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref> The Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew versions are available from Winsoft.<ref name=PhotoshopLanguages/> ==Plugins== {{Main|Photoshop plugin}} Photoshop functionality can be extended by add-on programs called [[Photoshop plugin]]s which act like mini-editors that modify the image. The most common type are filter plugins that provide various image effects. They are located in the 'Filter' menu. Photoshop plugin API has become a standard, and many other image editors also support Photoshop Plugins. Adobe Camera Raw (also known as ACR and Camera Raw) is a special plugin, supplied free by Adobe, used primarily to read and process [[Raw image format|raw image files]] so that the resultant images can be processed by Photoshop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html |title=Digital camera raw file support |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> It is invoked by attempting to open such a file, rather than from the 'Filter' menu, but like other plugins is listed in the 'Help > About Plug-In' menu (as "Camera Raw"). It can also be opened via the [[Adobe Bridge]] by clicking on any image and selecting 'File > Open in Adobe Camera Raw'. == Cultural impact == ''Photoshop'' and derivatives such as ''Photoshopped,'' ''Shopped,'' and ''Shooped'' have become verbs that are sometimes used to refer to images edited by Photoshop,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/2000/08/bc/28photoshop/|title=Photoshop through the Years|author=Macworld Staff}}</ref> or any image manipulating program. "Photoshop" is also used as a noun to refer to image editing programs [[Genericized trademark|in general]]. Such derivatives are discouraged by Adobe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html#section-4|title=PROPER USE OF THE PHOTOSHOP TRADEMARK}}</ref> == See also == * [[Adobe Photoshop Express]] * [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]] * [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]] * [[Image editing]] * [[Comparison of raster graphics editors]] * [[Photoshop contest]] == References == ;Notes {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}} <!--spacing--> {{Refimprove|date=December 2010}} == External links == {{Sister project links|Photoshop}} * {{Official website|http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/}} * {{dmoz|Computers/Software/Graphics/Image_Editing/Photoshop|Photoshop}} <!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================ | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
