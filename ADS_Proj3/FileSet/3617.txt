The Wavefinder had frequent software problems, and an unofficial patch called WaveLite was released in 2001.<ref name=register/> The Wavefinder had widely-reported problems with the USB drivers in [[Windows XP]] Service Pack 2. It will work with [[Windows XP]] with SP3. There are reports that the Wavefinder works in Vista. It is not compatible with [[Macintosh]] computers, except perhaps through the use of a [[PC emulator]] or [[Hardware virtualization|virtualisation]] solution. The unregulated power supply which is supplied with the Wavefinder has an output which can go up to 19 volts, this can cause the Wavefinder to develop faults. It is therefore recommended to use a regulated 12 volt supply.{{Or|date=August 2010}} ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://mobileopera.com/wavefinder An unofficial guide] * [http://www.spidersweb.freeserve.co.uk/dab/wffaq/ An unofficial FAQ] * [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A789302 h2g2 article] * [http://www.tracycurrer.com/portfolio2.htm The designer's page on the Wavefinder] [[Category:Digital radio]] [[Category:Computer peripherals]] {{compu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>30471</id> <title>Psychological nativism</title> <text>:''For nativism as a political force, see [[Nativism (politics)]]''. In the field of [[psychology]], '''nativism''' is the view that certain skills or abilities are 'native' or hard wired into the [[brain]] at [[Childbirth|birth]]. This is in contrast to [[empiricism]], the 'blank slate' or [[tabula rasa]] view, which states that the brain has inborn capabilities for learning from the environment but does not contain content such as innate beliefs. Some nativists believe that specific beliefs or preferences are ''hard wired.'' For example, one might argue that some moral intuitions are innate or that [[color preferences]] are innate. A less established argument is that nature supplies the human mind with specialized learning devices. This latter view differs from empiricism only to the extent that the algorithms that translate experience into information may be more complex and specialized in nativist theories than in empiricist theories. However, empiricists largely remain open to the nature of learning algorithms and are by no means restricted to the historical associationist mechanisms of [[behaviorism]]. ==In philosophy== Nativism has a history in philosophy, particularly
