provides a commonly-used solution. A more cumbersome remedy involves organizing the system in such a way that one unique process (running a [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]] or the like) has exclusive access to the file, and all other processes that need to access the data in that file do so only via interprocess communication with that one process (which of course requires synchronization at the process level). A different form of race condition exists in file systems where unrelated programs may affect each other by suddenly using up available resources such as disk space (or memory, or processor cycles). Software not carefully designed to anticipate and handle this race situation may then become quite fragile and unpredictable. Such a risk may be overlooked for a long time in a system that seems very reliable. But eventually enough data may accumulate or enough other software may be added to critically destabilize many parts of a system. Probably the best known example of this occurred with the near-loss of the [[Spirit rover|Mars Rover "Spirit"]] not long after landing, but this is a commonly overlooked hazard in many computer systems. A solution is for software to request ''and reserve'' all the resources it will need before beginning a task; if this request fails then the task is postponed, avoiding the many points where failure could have occurred. (Alternately, each of those points can be equipped with error handling, or the success of the entire task can be verified afterwards, before continuing on.) A more common but incorrect approach is to simply verify that enough disk space (for example) is available before starting a task; this is not adequate because in complex systems the actions of other running programs can be unpredictable. ====Networking==== In networking, consider a distributed chat network like [[IRC]], where a user acquires channel-operator privileges in any channel he starts. If two users on different servers, on different ends of the same network, try to start the same-named channel at the same time, each user's respective server will grant channel-operator privileges to each user, since neither server will yet have received the other server's signal that it has allocated that channel. (Note that this problem has been largely [[Internet_Relay_Chat#Abuse_prevention|solved]] by various IRC server implementations.) In this case of a race condition, the concept of the "shared [[resource (computer science)|resource]]" covers the state of the network (what channels exist, as well as what users started them and therefore have what privileges), which each server can freely change as long as it signals the other servers on the network about the changes so that they can update their conception of the state of the network. However, the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] across the network makes possible the kind of race condition described. In this case, heading off race conditions by imposing a form of control over access to the shared resource—say, appointing one server to control who holds what privileges—would mean turning the distributed network into a centralized one (at least for that one part of the network operation). ====Life-critical systems==== Software flaws in [[life-critical system]]s can be disastrous. Race conditions were among the flaws in the [[Therac-25]] [[radiation therapy]] machine, which led to the death of three patients and injuries to several more.<ref>http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3604/lib/Therac_25/Side_bar_1.html</ref> Another example is the Energy Management System provided by GE Energy and used by Ohio-based [[FirstEnergy Corp|FirstEnergy Corp.]] (among other power facilities). A race condition existed in the alarm subsystem; when three sagging power lines were tripped simultaneously, the condition prevented alerts from being raised to the monitoring technicians, delaying their awareness of the problem. This software flaw eventually led to the [[2003 North America blackout|North American Blackout of 2003]].<ref>http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8412</ref> GE Energy later developed a software patch to correct the previously undiscovered error. ===Computer security=== A specific kind of race condition involves checking for a predicate (e.g. for [[authentication]]), then acting on the predicate, while the state can change between the ''time of check'' and the ''time of use''. When this kind of [[Computer bug|bug]] exists in [[Computer security|security]]-conscious code, a [[security vulnerability]] called a [[time-of-check-to-time-of-use]] (''TOCTTOU'') bug is created. ==See also== {{Portal|Software Testing}} *[[Concurrency control]] *[[Deadlock]] *[[Synchronization]] *[[Linearizability]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/32.57622 Starvation and Critical Race Analyzers for Ada] *[http://www.ee.latrobe.edu.au/~jsw/ami6004/lectures/Lecture7/tsld039.htm VHDL example] *Paper "[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/251866.html Algorithms for the Optimal State Assignment of Asynchronous State Machines]" by [[Robert M.
