It allows users to build applications built on a movie [[interface metaphor|metaphor]], with the user as the "director" of the movie. Originally designed for creating animation sequences, the addition of a powerful scripting language called [[Lingo (programming language)|Lingo]] made it a popular choice for creating CD-ROMs and standalone kiosks and web content using Adobe [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]]. Adobe Director supports both 2D and 3D multimedia projects. == Comparing Director to Flash == The differences between these two products has been the subject of much discussion, especially in the Director development community. Extensibility is one of the main differences between the two, as are some of the sundry codecs that can be imported. Director has tended to be the larger of the two, but that footprint has been part of its weakness. This weakness manifest into the erosion of Director's ubiquity as the leader of authoring tools, especially in the critical window of 1998 - 2000. The download footprint of the Director Shockwave plugin was significantly larger than the Shockwave Flash download footprint. Additionally, Macromedia partnered with distributors such as Dell, Apple, etc. to have the Flash plugin pre-installed on machines for users, so that they would not be prompted to install any additional software. At that point in time (1998–2000), broadband internet access was not the norm for most users, and the fivefold difference in size was catastrophic. ==History== Director started out as [[MacroMind]] "VideoWorks", an application for the original [[Apple Macintosh]]. Animations were initially limited to the black and white of early Macintosh screens. The name was changed to "Director" in 1987, with the addition of new capabilities and the Lingo scripting language in 1988. A [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version was available in the early 1990s. From 1995 to 1997 a competing multimedia authoring program appeared called mTropolis (from mFactory). In 1997 mTropolis was purchased and buried by Quark, who had its own plans into multimedia authoring with Quark Immedia. ===Product Timeline=== *'''[[1985]]''': VideoWorks *'''[[1988]]''': Named Director 1.0 *'''[[1993]]''': Macromind Director became Macromedia Director (v 3.1.3) *'''[[1994]]''': Macromedia Director 4 was released (Windows and Powermac support) *'''[[1996]]''': Macromedia Director 5 was released (Shockwave) *'''[[1997]]''': Macromedia Director 6 was released (Behavior support) *'''[[1997]]''': Macromedia Director 6.5 was also released later that year *'''November 16, 1998''': Macromedia Director 7 was released *'''[[2000]]''': Macromedia Director 8 was released *'''[[2001]]''': Macromedia Director 8.5 was released (Shockwave3D) *'''[[2002]]''': Macromedia Director MX was released (Also known as Director 9) *'''January 5, 2004''': Macromedia Director MX 2004 was released (Also known as Director 10) *'''March 25, 2008''': Adobe Director 11 was released *'''March 23, 2009''': Adobe Director 11.5 was released *'''September 6, 2010''': Adobe Director 11.5.8 was released ==Adobe Director 11.x== The first Director release under the Adobe brand (v. 11) featured [[DirectX]] 9 and [[Unicode]] support and extended 3D capabilities based on the [[NVIDIA]] [[PhysX]] engine, as well as bitmap filters, enhanced video, audio and image file formats support, and [[Adobe Flash]] CS3 integration.

Flash is frequently used for advertisements and games. More recently, it has been positioned as a tool for "[[Rich Internet Application]]s" ("RIAs"). Flash manipulates [[vector graphics|vector]] and [[raster graphics]] to provide animation of text, drawings, and still images. It supports bidirectional [[Streaming media|streaming]] of audio and video, and it can capture user input via mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera. Flash contains an [[Object-oriented language]] called [[ActionScript]]. Flash content may be displayed on various computer systems and [[information appliance|devices]], using [[Adobe Flash Player]], which is available free of charge for common [[web browser]]s, some [[mobile phone]]s and a few other [[electronic device]]s (using [[Flash Lite]]). Some users feel that Flash enriches their web experience, while others find the extensive use of Flash animation, particularly in advertising, intrusive and annoying, giving rise to a cottage industry that specializes in blocking Flash content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tnerd.com/2010/02/18/how-to-block-flash-on-chrome-firefox-opera-internet-explorer-8/ |title=How to Block Flash |accessdate=2011-01-04 }}</ref> Flash has also been criticized for adversely affecting the usability of web pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html|title=Flash: 99% Bad |accessdate=2011-01-08 }}</ref> ==History== Originally developed by [[Macromedia]], Flash was introduced in 1996, and is currently developed and distributed by [[Adobe Systems]].
