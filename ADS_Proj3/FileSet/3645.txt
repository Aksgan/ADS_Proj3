model electron polyatomic molecule interactions. Since then Quantemol has widened to further types of simulation, with [[Plasma_(physics)|plasmas]] and industrial plasma tools, in [[#Quantemol-P|Quantemol-P]] and [[#Quantemol-D|Quantemol-D]]. == Quantemol-N == The Quantemol-N software system has been developed to simplify use of UK R-matrix codes. It provides an expert interface for non specialists to perform [[Ab_initio|ab initio]] electron-molecule scattering calculations. Quantemol-N calculates a variety of observables for electron molecule collisions including: * Elastic cross sections * Electronic excitation cross sections * Electron impact dissociation rates * Resonance parameters * Radial charge density calculation * Dissociative electron attachment cross sections * Ionisation cross sections * Differential cross sections * Momentum transfer sections * Vibration excitation cross sections === Applicable simulations === Quantemol-N is capable of tackling a variety of problems; * Closed shell molecules * Open shell molecules, and radicals * Neutral and positively charged species * Molecules of up to 17 atoms. ([[Neopentane|Neopentane]] has been successfully simulated, with improvements allowing more atoms in the future, and rapid movement towards [[Biomolecule|Biomolecules]]) === Accuracy === A study on the key benchmark molecule; water, gave results more accurate than obtainable experimentally ([http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/37/4/007 Faure et al. 2004]). Experimentally, there are problems measuring large cross sections at low angles; this applies to any molecule with a large dipole moment. Being a simulation, this is not a problem for Quantemol-N. === Relevant Publications === * [http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1742-6596/86/1/012001/jpconf7_86_012001.pdf?request-id=165a7b5b-03b1-4544-a086-08051b702d24 Quantemol-N: an expert system for performing electron molecule collision calculations using the R-matrix method] : Jonathan Tennyson, Daniel B.

Currently, experimental testing is used to establish the relevant plasma mixes to generate the desired etch. Such testing is an expensive and time-consuming process even for relatively minor improvements in the processes. Simulation allows much of this process can be done outside of the reactor at reduced cost and improved efficiency. Quantemol-P provides users with a means to simulate these processes. One of the key fundamental processes in etch plasmas is the collision of low-energy electrons with molecules. But for many years the associated molecular data has been missing from the plasma researchers' toolkit. Measurements of these collisions are both expensive and difficult to perform, and their theoretical determination requires the use of sophisticated procedures based on the application of quantum mechanics. === Program use === Quantemol-P assists in the research for new plasma recipes and optimizes given processes by simulating etch machines. The simulation inputs used match those of the plasma processing tools: e.g. power, pressure, gas flow rate, time, volume. The program couples molecular data and plasma models to provide full information on the various plasma processes. This gives users more insight into the problem than usually obtainable. A variety of technical plasmas can be simulated; including [[Plasma_etcher|plasma etch reactors]], plug-flow reactors and well-mixed reactors. The plasma model in Quantemol-P is based on the zero-dimensional global-kinetics simulation code GLOBALKIN developed over a number of years by Kushner and co-workers. === Relevant Publications === *[http://quantemol.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/quantemolp_avs.pdf Global plasma simulations using dynamically generated chemical models] : James J. Munro and Jonathan Tennyson : Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A, 26, 865 (2008) == Quantemol-D == The development of new machinery underpins the development of new technology, as without newer, more advanced machines large scale manufacturing is not possible. Traditionally the development of such machinery is costly and wasteful, with many iteration cycles throughout the design process. With the Quantemol-D software the machine design can be driven by high-level physics based simulation, leading to fewer physical iterations of the machine. Thus a cheaper, more efficient design process is created, which also has less impact on the environment. The software builds upon the respected Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM) codes developed by leading plasma physicist Professor Mark Kushner and others, adding a number of needed systems for both expert and non-expert users. Quantemol-D includes user interface enhancements, extensive documentation and support, data visualisation, analysis, job control, batch process and design of experiment support. ==See also== {{columns-list|3| * [[CP2K]] * [[GAMESS]] * [[GAUSSIAN]] * [[MOLCAS]] * [[MPQC]] * [[NWChem]] * [[PQS (chemical)|PQS]] * [[PSI (computational chemistry)|Psi3]] * [[Q-Chem]] * [[TURBOMOLE]] * [[Grace (plotting tool)|Grace]] * [[Global Arrays]] * [[Quantum chemistry computer programs]] }} == External links == * [http://quantemol.com/ Quantemol Official Site] * [http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1742-6596/86/1/012001/jpconf7_86_012001.pdf?request-id=165a7b5b-03b1-4544-a086-08051b702d24 Quantemol-N: an expert system for performing electron molecule collision calculations using the R-matrix method] * [http://quantemol.com/beta/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ACTAPHYSICAPOLONICAA.pdf Calculations of Cross Sections Data for Scattering of Electrons on HBr] * [http://quantemol.com/beta/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/j.1365-2966.2010.16207.x.pdf Electron-impact rotational excitation of the carbon monosulphide (CS) molecule] * [http://quantemol.com/products/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/QN_eBF3.pdf Cross-sections for the scattering of electrons with BF3] * [http://quantemol.com/products/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/quantemol_CH4.pdf R-matrix calculations of low-energy electron alkane collisions] * [http://quantemol.com/products/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/quantemol_HCN.pdf Electron
