to criticisms of LiveJournal's [[LiveJournal#The_word_.22friend.22|friending]] system, Dreamwidth has split user relationships into two parts: subscriptions and access control. Users may subscribe to other users' journals, or grant access for other users to read locked entries, as separate actions. Dreamwidth's terminology reflects this split: for instance the "friends page" has been renamed as "reading page", and "custom friends groups" has been split into "access filters" and "reading filters". ==== Interoperability ==== Dreamwidth provides greater interoperability with other Livejournal-based sites, including the ability to import a journal from another site, crosspost to multiple sites, and greater functionality for users who log in via [[OpenID]]. ==== Search ==== In addition to the search facilities brought over from LiveJournal, paid account users can [http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/search search their journal].

It supports such features as [[partition (computing)|partition]]ing, and [[low-level formatting]]. It could format hard drives in [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]], [[HFS Plus]] [[file systems]], and supported formatting drives for use with [[Linux]] and [[A/UX]]. ==History== In the mid 1990s, when Apple began shipping computers using [[AT Attachment|ATA]] hard drives, the SCSI drive formatting utility, [[Apple HD SC Setup]] was joined by [[Internal HD Format]] which could not format SCSI drives. It was first introduced with the [[PowerBook 150]] and [[Quadra 630]] in July 1994. Eventually, both Internal HD Format and Apple HD SC Setup were superseded with Drive Setup in 1995 and ultimately by [[Disk Utility]], both of which combined resources to format both SCSI and [[AT Attachment|IDE]] drives. {{Mac OS}} [[Category:Mac OS]] {{Mac-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>11102</id> <title>Drive bay</title> <text>[[Image:Drive bays.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Full-height, 2 half-height, and 3.5" drives]] A '''drive bay''' is a standard-sized area for adding [[Computer hardware|hardware]] to a computer. Most drive bays are fixed to the inside of a case, but some can be removed. Over the years since the introduction of the [[IBM PC]], it and [[IBM PC compatible|its compatibles]] have had three types of drive bay, of which two are in common use today. The original PC came equipped with 2 full height bays in which 5.25" floppy or hard disk drives could be mounted. Later, miniaturization of components brought about the half-height drive, which became the standard in the late 1980s. The 3.5" bay was introduced to mount the new 3.5" [[microfloppy]] drives, but later came to be used for 3.5" hard drives as well. A 3.5" bay is the same height as a half-height 5.25" bay. There is no "full height" 3.5" bay. Due to the [[Wintel]] platform's hegemony during the 1990s, its disk drive mounting configuration became standard across a wide variety of computer hardware. Mounting brackets exist to mount 3.5" drives in 5.25" bays. == Usage == Drive bays are most commonly used to store [[disk
