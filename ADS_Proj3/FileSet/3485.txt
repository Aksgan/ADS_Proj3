signal regeneration systems (e.g., [[clock recovery]] designs).<ref name=wol91p211>[[#Wol1991|Wolaver, 1991, p.211]]</ref> A '''proportional''' phase detector employs a charge pump that supplies charge amounts in proportion to the phase error detected. Some have dead bands and some do not. Specifically, some designs produce both "up" and "down" control pulses even when the phase difference is zero. These pulses are small, nominally the same duration, and cause the charge pump to produce equal-charge positive and negative current pulses when the phase is perfectly matched. Phase detectors with this kind of control system don't exhibit a dead band and typically have lower minimum peak-to-peak jitter when used in PLLs. In PLL applications it is frequently required to know when the loop is out of lock. The more complex digital phase-frequency detectors usually have an output that allows a reliable indication of an out of lock condition. ==Electronic phase detector== Some signal processing techniques such as those used in [[radar]] may require both the amplitude and the phase of a signal, to recover all the information encoded in that signal. One technique is to feed an amplitude-limited signal into one port of a [[product detector]] and a reference signal into the other port; the output of the detector will represent the phase difference between the signals. If the signal is different in frequency from the reference, the detector output will be periodic at the difference frequency.<ref>[[Donald G. Fink]] (ed), ''Electronic Engineers Handbook'', McGraw Hill, New York 1975, ISBN 0-07-02980-4 pg. 25-76</ref> ==Optical phase detectors== Phase detectors are also known in [[optics]] as [[List of types of interferometers|interferometers]]. For pulsed ([[amplitude modulated]]) light, it is said to measure the phase between the carriers. It is also possible to measure the delay between the envelopes of two short optical pulses by means of [[cross correlation]] in a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear crystal]]. And it is possible to measure the [[Frequency comb|phase between the envelope and the carrier of an optical pulse]], by sending a pulse into an [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear crystal]]. There the spectrum gets wider and at the edges the shape depends significantly on the phase. ==Further reading== *<cite id=#Craw1994>* Crawford, James A. 1994.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], "phase diagram" is used with a different meaning: a synonym for a [[phase space]]. == Overview == Common components of a phase diagram are ''lines of equilibrium'' or ''phase boundaries'', which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple phases can coexist at equilibrium. Phase transitions occur along lines of equilibrium. [[Triple point]]s are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium intersect. Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist. For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium. The [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid state. The [[liquidus]] is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a "slurry").<ref>{{cite book|last=Predel|first=Bruno |coauthors=Hoch, Michael J. R; Pool, Monte|title=Phase Diagrams and Heterogeneous Equilibria : A Practical Introduction|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540140115}}<!-- Reference 1 covers most of the article.--></ref> == Types of phase diagrams == === 2D phase diagrams=== The simplest phase diagrams are pressure-temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as [[water (molecule)|water]]. The [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] correspond to the [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The phase diagram shows, in pressure-temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]]. [[Image:Phase-diag2.svg|thumb|250px|left|A typical phase diagram. The dotted line gives [[Water_(molecule)#Density_of_water_and_ice|the anomalous behavior of water]]. The green lines mark the [[freezing point]] and the blue line the [[boiling point]], showing how they vary with pressure.]] The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point. The open spaces, where the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is [[analytic function|analytic]], correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical, where [[phase transition]]s occur, which are called '''phase boundaries'''. In the diagram on the left, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable,<ref>P. Papon, J. Leblond, and P.H.E.
