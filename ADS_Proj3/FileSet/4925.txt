Zentyal can act as a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|Gateway]], Network Infrastructure Manager, [[Unified threat management|Unified Threat Manager]], Office Server, [[Unified Communications]] Server or a combination of them. Besides, Zentyal includes a [[Software framework|development framework]] to ease the development of new [[Unix]] based services. The project's [[source code]] is available under terms of the [[GNU General Public License]], as well as under a variety of [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] agreements.

Its design incorporates modern programming techniques as: * Design patterns: an [[Observer pattern|Observer]] design pattern is used mainly to integrate different modules across Zentyal. E.g. each service reports about which ports it needs to be open. Besides this, a [[Singleton pattern|Singleton]] holds global configuration and behavior details. * Presentation and logic decoupling: user interface uses [[CSS]] and [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], and include several Mason components, as a generic table used to configure services. Program logic is held inside [[library (computing)|library]] packages and [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]-like code. * Fault tolerance: errors and warnings are managed through software exceptions, flowing from core to its handling routine. It also offers debugging facilities, integrating the layout of the execution stack of the Perl 5 interpreter. Service are monitored and automatically respawned if they die. === Open
