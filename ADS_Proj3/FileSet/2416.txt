Key fobs are often called "[[key ring]]s" or "[[key chain]]s" in colloquial usage. The word ''fob'' may be linked to the low German dialect for the word ''Fuppe'', meaning "pocket", however, the real origin of the word is uncertain. Fob pockets (meaning 'sneak proof' from the German word Foppen) were pockets meant to deter thieves and a chain was used (called a Fob Chain) to attach to items, like a pocket watch, that you would place in them. (See: http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/fob) Fobs vary considerably in size, style and functionality. Most commonly they are simple discs of smooth metal or plastic, typically with a message or symbol such as that of a [[logo]] (as with conference [[tchotchke]]) or a sign of an important group affiliation. A fob may be symbolic or strictly aesthetic, but it can also be a small tool. Many fobs are small [[flashlight]]s, [[compasses]], [[calculators]], [[penknives]], [[discount card]]s, [[bottle openers]], [[security token]]s and [[USB flash drives]]. As electronic technology continues to become smaller and cheaper, miniature key-fob versions of (previously) larger devices are becoming common, such as [[digital photo frame]]s, [[remote control]] units for [[garage door opener]]s and simple [[video game]]s (e.g. [[Tamagotchi]]) or other [[gadget]]s such as [[Breathalyzer]]s.[[Image:SundryKeyFobs2154.jpg|thumb|left|width200|A [[carabiner]], [[USB flash drive]], [[keyless entry system]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] membership token serving as key fobs.]] ==Access control uses== [[Electronics|Electronic]] key fobs are used for activating such things as [[Keyless entry systems|remote keyless entry systems]] on [[motor vehicles]]. Early electric key fobs operated using [[infrared]] and required a clear [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] to function. These could be copied using a programmable [[remote control]]. More recent models use [[challenge-response authentication]] over [[radio frequency]], so these are harder to
