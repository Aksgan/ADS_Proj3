early incarnations used the 80×25 character [[text mode]], meaning very speedy screen updates, even on slow PCs. A homebrew multi-tasking kernel allowed users to have several Minuet windows active at the same time. An FTP session could be transferring files, while in another window one could be composing an e-mail. All the parts of Minuet used multi-tasking, so you never got hung up waiting for some slow operation to complete. ==Functions== ===E-Mail=== E-mail in Minuet resembles most standard e-mail programs — ''From:'', ''To:'', ''cc:'', ''Bcc:'', and ''Message body'' fields. Attachments use the [[BinHex]] and [[UUCP]] encoding schemes, which predated [[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions |MIME]] types and were popular in Minuet's days. ===Newsgroups=== Newsgroups appeared much like e-mail folders. An innovative concept was included — Minuet would not attempt to download the whole newsgroups file, which even then included thousands of newsgroups. Instead, a [[Perl]] server was contacted to search for interesting newsgroups. This cut down the newsgroup searching startup time from many minutes to a few seconds. ===FTP=== Minuet was one of the first programs to have a graphical tree-structured approach to FTP. At the time, most FTP clients required an almost endless sequence of "[[cd (command)|cd]]", "[[ls]]" commands to browse the server. ===Web browser=== In later releases, Minuet included a rudimentary Web browser — a challenge to implement on a 640 KiB [[real mode]] PC. If a graphics card was available, Minuet could display web pages containing [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] or [[JPEG]] images. ==SLIP== At that time most computer users were using modems for communications, so a good modem-capable driver was required. Unfortunately, [[Serial Line Internet Protocol|SLIP]] drivers were poor — hard to configure, difficult to test, missing important features, like dialing, and often not using all of the buffering features of the serial port chips. There was not much point in releasing an easy-to-use Minuet if the modem access was lousy, so the same team developed a better SLIP driver and dial-up program. ==See also== *[[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] (text-based) *[[Arachne (web browser)|Arachne]] (graphical) ==External links== *[http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/minuet/ Minuet download page] {{gopher clients}} {{Earlybrowsers}} {{Internet suits}} {{E-mail clients}} {{FOLDOC}} [[Category:Gopher clients]] [[Category:Web browsers for DOS]] [[Category:1994 software]] [[Category:Internet suites]] [[Category:Discontinued software]] [[Category:Discontinued web browsers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24698</id> <title>Minnie Earl Sears</title> <text>'''Minnie Earl Sears''' (17 November 1873 – 28 November 1933) formulated the '''Sears Subject Headings''', a simplification of the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]. ==Life and work== Sears was a native of [[Lafayette, Indiana]], and was awarded a [[B.Sc.]] from [[Purdue University]] at age 18, the youngest graduate in her class. She received an [[M.Sc]] in 1893. In 1900 the [[University of Illinois]] awarded to her a [[Bachelor of Library Science|Bachelor of Library Science degree]]. Sears had a long career as a cataloguer and bibliographer at a variety of libraries ([[Bryn Mawr College]], [[University of Minnesota]], [[New York Public Library]]), before she joined the publishing company [[H. W. Wilson Company]] in 1923 to publish her ''List of Subject Headings for Small Libraries''. The book provides a list of subject headings for small libraries to use in lieu of [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]. Library of Congress headings are often not as useful for small libraries because they are too detailed. Sears’ ''List of Subject Headings'' also offers small libraries guidance on how to create their own new subject headings consistently when necessary. In order to create her subject headings, Sears consulted small and medium sized libraries throughout the country to discern patterns of usage. She then developed her own system, based in part on the Library of Congress Subject Headings, but with a simplified subject vocabulary. In Sears’ system, common terms are much preferred over scientific and technical terms. Her system also allowed individual libraries the authority to create their own subject headings. The Sears model is not meant to serve as a standardized bridge for union catalogs, but rather as a model “for the creation of headings as needed”. Like the Library of Congress Subject Headings, Sears' system is a subject list arranged in alphabetical order, making use of overarching subject categories and hierarchical subject subdivisions. However, Sears’ headings favor natural language. Her headings make use of only four types of headings: topical, form, geographic, and proper names. She also tended to convert inverted headings into direct entries. In the third edition of the book (1933), Ms. Sears added a section called, “Practical Suggestions for the Beginner in Subject Heading Work”. These “Principles of the Sears List” were eventually published as a separate document and became a widely used teaching tool for library schools. In subsequent editions of the List, Sears’ subject headings were also linked to appropriate [[Dewey Decimal]] numbers. In addition to creating the List, Sears edited the ''Standard Catalog for Public Libraries'' of the [[American Library Association]], and an edition of the ''Standard Catalog for High School Libraries''. She eventually left H.W. Wilson to teach at [[Columbia University]]'s School of Library Science, where she started the first graduate course in cataloging. Sears also remained an active participant in the American Library Association and the [[New York Library Association]]. After her death in 1933 at age 60, the book was eventually renamed in her honor to ''The Sears List of Subject Headings''. The List is currently in its 20th edition. ==External links== * {{cite web | title=Minnie Earl Sears: The Woman behind ''Sears List'' | url=http://www.hwwilson.com/news/news_2_6_04.htm | accessdate=1 November 2008 }} * {{cite web | title=Sears Subject Headings | url=http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr517/03-04-wt2/projects/KidsCatWeb/Sears/SearsLayout.html | accessdate=10 October 2005 }} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Sears, Minnie Earl | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 17 November 1873 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 28 November 1933 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Sears, Minnie Earl}} [[Category:1873 births]] [[Category:1933 deaths]] [[Category:American librarians]] [[Category:Library and information science]] [[es:Minnie Earl Sears]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24704</id> <title>Mir (computer)</title> <text>[[Image:Computer MIR-1.jpg|thumb|252px|МИР-1]] '''MIR''' (МИР) is the name of a series of early Soviet [[computer]]s, developed from 1965 (MIR-1) to 1969 (MIR-2) in a group
