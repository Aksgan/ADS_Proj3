Their name appears to be a reference to the antagonists of [[Challenge of the Superfriends]]. LOD was founded by the hacker Lex Luthor, after a rift with his previous group the Knights of Shadow. At different points in the group's history, LOD was split into LOD and LOD/LOH (Legion of Doom/Legion of Hackers) for the members that were more skilled at hacking than pure [[phreaking]]. Unlike Masters of Deception there were different opinions regarding what the Legion of Doom was. LOD published the '''Legion of Doom Technical Journals''' and regularly contributed to the overall pool of hacking knowledge and information, while causing no direct harm to the phone systems and computer networks they took over.{{Dubious|date=August 2010}} On the other hand, many LOD members were raided, charged and in some cases successfully prosecuted for causing alleged damage to systems and reprogramming phone company computers (Grant, Darden and Riggs, etc). Although the overall expressed beliefs and behavior of LOD and MOD were different, it can be difficult to untangle the individual actions of any given member. In many cases there seemed to be cross-overs between the two groups or collaboration between LOD and MOD members. ==Members of LOD== As of 2009 what has happened to each individual member of the Legion of Doom is unknown. A small handful of the higher-profile LOD members who are accounted for includes: [[Chris Goggans]] "Erik Bloodaxe", [[Dave Buchwald]] "Bill From RNOC", [[Patrick K. Kroupa]] "Lord Digital", [[Loyd Blankenship]] "The Mentor", [[Bruce Fancher]] "Dead Lord" and [[Mark Abene]] "Phiber Optik", who was a member of both LOD and [[Masters of Deception]] (MOD).
