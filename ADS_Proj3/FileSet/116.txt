The effort found little support in the market and dissolved due to a lack of sales and infighting within the group. == Formation == The consortium was announced on April 9, 1991 by [[Compaq]], [[Microsoft]], [[MIPS Computer Systems]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]].<ref>{{cite news | first = | last = | authorlink = John Markoff | author = John Markoff | title = New Computer Alliance Forms | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DA1438F93BA35757C0A967958260 | publisher = The New York Times | date = 1991-04-08 | accessdate = 2007-05-03 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news | title = New breed of computers based on new standard UNIX/RISC software debuts: Compaq's Rod Canion says 'ACE' destined to be environment of choice for the 1990s. | publisher = Software Industry Report | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/technology/computer-software/157919-1.html | date = 1991-04-15 | accessdate = 2010-02-20 }}</ref> Other members of the consortium included [[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Control Data Corporation]], [[Kubota]], [[NEC Corporation]], [[JFE Group|NKK]], [[Olivetti]], [[Prime Computer]], [[Pyramid Technology]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sony]], [[Sumitomo]], [[Tandem Computers]], [[Wang Laboratories]], and [[Zenith Data Systems]]. Besides these large companies, several [[start-up companies]] built ACE-compliant systems as well. The environment standardized on the [[MIPS architecture]] and two [[operating system]]s: [[SCO UNIX]] with [[Open Desktop]] and what would become [[Windows NT]] (originally named OS/2 3.0). The [[Advanced RISC Computing]] (ARC) document was produced to give hardware and firmware specifications for the platform. The porting of the Microsoft operating system to other [[instruction set architectures]] created hope that other hardware platforms could more effectively compete with [[Wintel]] [[Personal computer|PC]]s . The belief was that [[RISC]]-based computers would deliver superior price-performance to that of the older platform. Eventually, Windows NT was also ported to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] and [[PowerPC]] architectures as well. The initiative was used by microprocessor companies as an attempt to take market share away from Intel. System companies used the initiative as an attempt to take market share away from the [[workstation]] leader, [[Sun Microsystems]]. ==The "Apache Group"== Soon after the initiative was announced, a dissenting faction of seven ACE members declared that the decision to support only little-[[endian]] architectures was short-sighted. This subgroup, known as the '''Apache Group''', promoted a big-endian alternative. The group, whose name was conceived as a pun on "Big Indian", was unrelated to the later [[Apache Software Foundation]]. It later adopted the name ''MIPS/Open''. A rift within the ACE consortium was averted when it was decided to add support for big-endian [[SVR4]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Apache Group of True Blue UNIX System V.4 ACE Renegades Ready to Show Their Hand | url = https://www.cbronline.com/article_cg.asp?guid=0DC06F35-6F0C-446E-92B6-C816E16F3E9B | publisher = Computer Business Review | date = 1991-10-23 | accessdate = 2007-05-03 }}</ref> ==Dissolution== Even so, the ACE initiative (and consortium) began to fall apart little more than a year after it started, as it became apparent that there was not a mass market for an alternative to the [[Wintel]] computing platform. The upstart platforms did not offer enough performance improvement from the incumbent PC and there were major cost disadvantages of such systems due to the low volume production. When the initiative started, RISC based systems (running at 100-200 MHz at the time) had substantial performance advantage over [[Intel 80486]] and original [[Intel P5|Pentium]] chips (running at approximately 60 MHz at the time).{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} Intel quickly migrated the Pentium design to newer [[semiconductor]] process generations and that performance (and operating frequency) advantage slipped away.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Compaq was the first company to leave the consortium, stating that with the departure of CEO [[Rod Canion]], one of the primary backers behind the formation of ACE, they were shifting priorities away from higher-end systems.<ref>{{cite news | author = Jonathan Cassell | coauthors = Gerry Khermouch, Craig Stedman, Stuart Zipper | title = Is ACE consortium in the hole as Compaq, SCO throw in cards? | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n1910_v38/ai_12177680 | publisher = Electronic News | date = 1992-05-04 | accessdate = 2007-05-03 }}</ref> This was followed in short order by SCO announcing that they were suspending all work on moving their version of Unix to the MIPS platform. There were other potential conflicts: earlier that year, MIPS had been purchased by SGI, which may have also contributed to concerns about the neutrality of the target platform. DEC had released their Alpha processor and were less interested in promoting a competing architecture. And finally, the significant improvements in Intel [[x86]] performance made abandoning it less attractive, and although ACE supported x86 for a time, Intel was never a member. ==See also== * The [[AIM alliance]]â€”a competing initiative based on the [[PowerPC]], led by [[Apple Computer]], [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/Hardware/Machines/ARC/ NetBSD project description of ACE (contains following links)] *[http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/Hardware/Machines/ARC/riscspec.pdf ARC specification pdf file at www.netbsd.org] *[http://www.byte.com/art/9606/sec5/art1.htm Byte Magazine article from 1996 June looking back five years to the announcement of ACE] [[Category:Computer and telecommunication standards]] [[Category:Advanced RISC Computing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1114</id> <title>Advanced Load Address Table</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} The '''Advanced Load Address Table''' (ALAT) is a functional unit in the Intel [[Itanium]] processor architecture.
