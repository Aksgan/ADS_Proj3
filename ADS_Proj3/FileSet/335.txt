A video image of a person talking can be analysed by the software. The shapes made by the lips can be examined and then turned into sounds. The sounds are compared to a dictionary to create matches to the words being spoken. The technology was used successfully to analyse silent home movie footage of [[Adolf Hitler]] taken by [[Eva Braun]] at their [[Bavaria]]n retreat [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berghof]].

[[Run-time system|runtime]] engines such as those for the [[Java language]] or [[Microsoft .Net]] lend themselves to an automated mode of exception or error handling. In these environments software errors do not 'crash' the operating system or the [[runtime engine]] but rather generate exceptions. Recent advances in these runtime engines enables specialized runtime-engine add-on products to provide automated [[exception handling]] that is independent of the source code and provides root-cause information for every exception of interest.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} == How it works == Upon exception, the runtime engine calls an error interception tool that is attached to the runtime engine (e.g. [[JVM]]). Based on the nature of the exception such as its type and the class and method in which it occurred and based on user preferences, an exception can be either handled or ignored. If the preference is to handle the exception, then based on handling preferences such as memory search depth, the error interception utility extracts memory values from heap and stack memories. This snapshot then produces the equivalent of a [[debugger]] screen (as if there had been a debugger) at the precise moment of the exception. == Advantages == This mechanism enables the automated handling of software errors independent of the source code of the application and independent of its developers. It is a direct artifact of the runtime engine paradigm and it enables unique advantages to the software lifecycle that were not available before. ==References== <references /> {{DEFAULTSORT:Automated Exception Handling}} [[Category:Java programming language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2878</id> <title>Automated information systems security</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=November 2010}} {{Orphan|date=February 2009}} In [[telecommunication]], the term '''automated information systems security''' refers to measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and [[availability]] of the [[information]] processed and stored by automated information systems. The unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction may be accidental or intentional. Automated [[information systems security]] includes consideration of all [[hardware]] and [[software]] functions, characteristics and features; operational procedures; accountability procedures; and [[access control]]s at the central [[computer]] facility, remote computer, and [[computer terminal|terminal]] facilities; management constraints; physical structures and devices, such as computers, [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] lines, and [[Electric power|power]] sources; and personnel and [[telecommunication|communications]] controls needed to provide an acceptable level of risk for the [[automated information system]] and for the [[data]] and information contained in the system. Automated information systems security also includes the totality of security safeguards needed to provide an acceptable protection level for an automated information system and for the data handled by an automated information system. In [[INFOSEC]] automated information systems security is a synonym for [[computer security]]. ==See also== *[[Federal Standard 1037C]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Automated Information Systems Security}} [[Category:Computer security procedures]] [[Category:Telecommunications terms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2886</id> <title>Automated teller machine</title> <text>{{For|the [[Hard-Fi]] song|Cash Machine}} <blockquote> </blockquote>[[Image:ATM 750x1300.jpg|thumb|An [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] Personas 75-Series interior, multi-function ATM in the [[United States|USA]].]] [[Image:ICAs uttagsautomat ICA Metro Skanstull Stockholm 2005-07-18.jpg|thumb|right|Smaller indoor ATMs dispense money inside [[convenience store]]s and other busy areas, such as this off-premise [[Wincor Nixdorf]] mono-function ATM in [[Sweden]].]] An '''automated teller machine''' ('''ATM'''), also known as a '''automated banking machine''' ('''ABM''') or '''Cash Machine''' and by several other names (see below), is a computerised telecommunications device that provides the [[customer|clients]] of a [[financial institution]] with access to [[financial transaction]]s in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or [[bank teller]]. On most modern ATMs, the customer is identified by inserting a plastic [[ATM card]] with a [[magnetic stripe]] or a plastic [[smart card]] with a [[Integrated circuit|chip]], that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or [[Card Security Code|CVVC]] (CVV). Authentication is provided by the customer entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). Using an ATM, customers can access their bank [[Deposit account|account]]s in order to make [[cash]] withdrawals, [[credit card]] cash advances, and check their account balances as well as purchase prepaid cellphone credit. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that which the bank account is denominated in (e.g.: Withdrawing Japanese Yen from a bank account containing US Dollars), the money will be converted at a wholesale [[exchange rate]]. Thus, ATMs often provide the best possible exchange rate for foreign travelers<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16994358/ MSN.com]</ref> and are heavily used for this purpose as well.
