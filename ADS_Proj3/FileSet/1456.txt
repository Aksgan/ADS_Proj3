In the ''Fastra II'', the GPUs mainly perform [[tomographic reconstruction]]. The technique which allows GPUs to perform general-purpose tasks like this outside of gaming, instead of [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], is called [[GPGPU]], general-purpose computing on graphics processing units. Due to the massive amount of heat caused by the lack of space between all of the video cards, the researchers are forced to keep the side panel door open, so that the video cards can get regular air, and thus decreases the overall temperature inside the case.<ref name="Benchmarks" /> Due to the amount of GPUs in the system, at the initial attempt it did not boot. This was because its motherboard uses a 32 bit [[BIOS]]. The 32 bit BIOS which originally was in the system only had roughly 3 GB of address space for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the GTX 295 video cards.<ref name="Technical details">{{cite web | url=http://fastra2.ua.ac.be/?page_id=214 | title=Technical details | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | accessdate=16 December 2010}}</ref> All seven PCI Express x16 slots in the Asus P6T7 motherboard were used in the building of the ''Fastra II'' computer. However, the video cards in the ''Fastra II'' are wide enough to require two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage, which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.<ref name="Main page" /> == Specifications and benchmarks == Like the ''Fastra I'', the ''Fastra II'' uses a Lian Li PC-P80 Armorsuit case, which has 10 expansion slots. The [[motherboard]] in the ''Fastra II'' was at that time the only [[workstation]] motherboard that had seven full-sized [[PCI Express]] x16 slots.<ref name="Specifications" /> The memory modules were initially six 2 GB modules, but were later upgraded to 4 GB each, for a total of 24 GB.<ref name="RAM upgrade">{{cite web | url=http://fastra2.ua.ac.be/?p=647 | title=System upgrade: 24GB of DDR3 RAM | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | date=23 April 2010 | accessdate=16 December 2010}}</ref> Instead of an eighth dual-GPU video card, the single-GPU GTX 275 is in the computer because, out of all the video cards in the Fastra II, the GTX 275 is the only one the Fastra II's BIOS can fully initialize. The total amount of GPUs is 13.

According to the [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] on its official website, the ''Fastra II'' is faster and more power efficient than its competitors, including the ''Fastra I'' and the ''Tesla C1060''.<ref name="Benchmarks">{{cite web | url=http://Fastra2.ua.ac.be/?page_id=53 | title=Fastra II benchmarks | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> The benchmarks were performed on the ''Fastra II'', the ''Fastra I'', a 512-core cluster (consisting of [[Opteron]] CPUs), an [[Nvidia Tesla]] C1060 workstation card on an [[Intel Core i7]] 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The ''Fastra II'' is over three times faster than the ''Fastra I'' in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the ''Fastra II'' consumes more power than its predecessor, the ''Fastra I'', it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the ''Fastra I'', and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees [[Celsius]] when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load. <gallery> File:Fastra II slice reconstruction speed.png|Graph showing the CT slice reconstruction speed for the ''Fastra II'' and its competitors File:Fastra II power consumption.png|Graph showing peak power consumption for the ''Fastra II'' and its competitors File:Fastra II energy efficiency.png|Graph showing the energy efficiency for the ''Fastra II'' and its competitors File:Fastra II bone resolution quality.png|Image showing the differences between the ''Fastra I'' and the ''Fastra II'' in spatial resolution that is required to analyze changes of bone parameters </gallery> == Applications and reception == The ''Fastra II'' received positive public impression.
