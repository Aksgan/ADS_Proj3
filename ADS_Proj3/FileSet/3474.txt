or any other needs. A special case of this model is community lending in [[microfinance]] where a loan is made to a specific individual but the lending agreement is structured to hold the borrower's social group either directly accountable for the repayment of the loan (akin to "cosigning") or indirectly accountable, whereby the entire social group may face future consequences, such as reduced access to credit or higher future rates, if one of its members fails to repay an obligation. ===Services offered=== ====Loan origination==== The services offered include matching borrowers to lenders, calculating interest rates and repayment terms and disbursing funds. See also [[loan origination]]. ====Loan servicing==== The services offered include formalizing loans by creating written documents, establishing payment schedules, ensuring timely payments and collecting funds from one party and transferring them to another. See also [[loan servicing]]. ==Legal regulation== In most countries, soliciting investments from the general public is considered illegal and [[crowd sourcing]] arrangements in which people are asked to contribute money in exchange for potential profits based on the work of others are considered a [[Security_(finance)|security]]. Dealing with financial securities is connected to the problem about ownership -- in case of person-to-person loans, who owns the loans (notes) and how that ownership is transferred between the originator of the loan (the person-to-person lending company) and the individual lender(s).<ref>[http://www.peer-lend.com/2008/04/08/lending-club-shuts-down-temporarily/ Lending Club Shuts Down (Temporarily?)] Peer-Lend, Apr. 8, 2008</ref><ref>Mark Hendrickson [http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/08/lending-club-puts-moratorium-on-lending-activity/ Lending Club Puts Hold on Lending Activity While It Sorts Out Some Legal Issues] TechCrunch, Apr 8, 2008</ref> This question arises especially when a peer-to-peer lending company does not just connect lenders and borrowers but borrows money from users and then lends it out again. Such activity is interpreted as a sale of securities and a broker-dealer license and the registration of the person-to-person investment contract is required for the process to be legal. The license and registration can be obtained at a securities regulatory agency such as the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in the U.S., the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] in Ontario, Canada, the [[Autorité des marchés financiers]] in France and Quebec, Canada, or the [[Financial Services Authority]] in the U.K. The emergence of multiple competing lending companies and problems with subprime loans has also called for additional legislative measures that institute minimum capital standards and checks on risk controls to preclude lending to riskier borrowers, using unscrupulous lenders or misleading consumers about lending terms.<ref>Sean Farrell [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8012269/Zopa-calls-on-Government-and-FSA-to-regulate-social-lending-sector.html Zopa calls on Government and FSA to regulate social lending sector] Telegraph, Sept 20, 2010.</ref> ==Advantages and criticism== One of the main advantages of person-to-person lending for borrowers has been better rates than traditional bank rates can offer (often below 10%<ref>[http://www.sociallending.net Social Lending Network], accessed Sept. 21, 2010</ref>). The advantages for lenders are higher returns than obtainable from a savings account or other investments.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21993720/ Person-to-person lending online gathers steam] Associated Press, Nov. 27, 2007.</ref>. Both of these benefits are the result of disintermediation, the lack of high overheads to traditional financial institutions with many employees and costly locations. The paucity of administrative procedures in person-to-person lending has the additional benefit that loan application and the transfer of funds takes less time and both borrowers and lenders can access their money faster. As person-to-person lending companies and their customer base continue to grow, though, marketing expenses and administrative costs associated with customer service and arbitration, maintaining product information, and developing quality websites to service customers and stand out among competitors will rise, and compliance to legal regulations becomes more complicated. This causes many of the original benefits from disintermediation to fade away and turns person-to-person companies into new intermediaries, much like the banks that they originally differentiated from. Such process of re-introduction of intermediaries is known as [[Disintermediation#Reintermediation|reintermediation]]. Person-to-person lending also attracts borrowers who, because of their past credit status or the lack of thereof, are unqualified for traditional bank loans. The unfortunate situation of these borrowers is, however, well known for the people issuing the loans and results in very high interest rates that verges on [[predatory lending]] and [[loan sharking]]. At the same time, because past behavior is frequently indicative of future performance and low credit scores correlate with high likelihood of defaulting, many person-to-person intermediaries have begun to decline borrowers whose credit scores are below a certain bound. It seemed initially that one of the appealing characteristics of person-to-person lending for investors was low default rates, e.g. Prosper's default rate was quoted to be only at about 2.7 percent in 2007.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21993720/ Person-to-person lending online gathers steam] Associated Press, Nov. 27, 2007.</ref> It was shown later that the original numbers were highly elevated by the fact that person-to-person lending companies were young and many new loans had not had time to go bad yet, and that, e.g. the actual default rates for the loans originated on Prosper in 2007 were in fact 36%<ref>Mark Gimein [http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/money-trail/2010/01/18/you-are-unlikely-prosper You Are Unlikely To Prosper: Person-to-person lending is much riskier than you’ve been told] The Big Money, Jan. 18, 2010</ref> or even 45.3%.<ref>[http://fred93blog.blogspot.com/2010/08/prospercom-072010-late-loan-stats.html Prosper.com - 07/2010 Late Loan Stats Update] Fred93's Blog: A lender's view of Prosper.com, Aug 2, 2010</ref> ==See also== * [[Alternative financial services]] * [[Crowd funding]] * [[Crowdsourcing]] * [[Disintermediation]] * [[Peer-to-peer (meme)]] * [[Peer to peer banking|Peer-to-peer banking]] * [[:Category:Peer-to-peer_lending_companies|Person-to-person lending companies]] * [[Microcredit]] * [[Microfinance]] * [[Social commerce]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/08/01/8269646/index.htm Peer-to-Peer Banking] - CNN Money: Business 2.0 Magazine, Aug. 1, 2005 * [http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=websites&id=3662820 Credit Lending Online Service] - ABC News, Nov. 23, 2005 * [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6208227 Avoiding the Pitfalls of Family Borrowing] - National Public Radio, Oct. 6, 2006 * [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/21/eveningnews/main3959346.shtml In Credit Crunch, Lending To Each Other] - CBS Evening News, March 21, 2008 * [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1718569,00.html Hey, Buddy, Can You Spare $10,000?] - Time Magazine, Feb 29 2008 * [http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=6123763 Social Lending Offers Alternatives] - ABC News, Oct. 28, 2008 * [http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/web/2009/hbr-list/forget-citibank-borrow-from-bob Forget Citibank, Borrow From Bob] - Harvard Business Review, Jan. 1, 2009 * [http://www.americanwaymag.com/prosper-renaud-laplanche-madeline-smith-nhat-nguyen The Money Web] - American Way Magazine, July 1, 2008 * [http://blogs.wsj.com/wallet/2009/01/22/peer-to-peer-lending-refuses-to-die/ Peer-to-Peer Lending Refuses to Die] - The Wall
