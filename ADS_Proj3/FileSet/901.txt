(marketing)|promotions]] you are running, and other metrics that may affect sales. What you are likely to experience is that the model will become less and less accurate over time - you will be a victim of concept drift. In the merchandise sales application, one reason for concept drift may be seasonality, which means that shopping behavior changes seasonally. You will likely have higher sales in the winter holiday season than during the summer. ==Possible remedies== To prevent [[deterioration]] in [[prediction]] accuracy over time the model has to be refreshed periodically. One approach is to retrain the model using only the most recently observed samples (Widmer and Kubat, 1996). Another approach is to add new inputs which may be better at explaining the causes of the concept drift. For our sales prediction application you may be able to reduce concept drift by adding information about the season to your model. By providing information about the time of the year you will likely reduce rate of deterioration of your model, but you likely will never be able to prevent concept drift altogether. This is because actual shopping behavior does not follow any static, [[finite model]]. New factors may arise at any time that influence shopping behavior, the influence of the known factors or their interactions may change. Concept drift cannot be avoided if you are looking to predict a complex phenomenon that is not governed by fixed [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. All processes that arise from human activity, such as [[socioeconomic]] processes, and [[biological processes]] are likely to experience concept drift. Therefore, periodic retraining, also known as refreshing of your model is inescapable. ==Software== * [[RapidMiner]] ([http://rapid-i.com/ RapidMiner, formerly YALE (Yet Another Learning Environment)]): free open-source software for knowledge discovery, data mining, and machine learning also featuring data stream mining, learning time-varying concepts, and tracking drifting concept (if used in combination with its data stream mining plugin (formerly: concept drift plugin)) * EDDM ([http://iaia.lcc.uma.es/Members/mbaena/papers/eddm/ EDDM (Early Drift Detection Method)]): free open-source implementation of drift detection methods in [[Weka (machine learning)]]. * MOA ([http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~abifet/MOA/ Massive Online Analysis]): free open-source software specific for mining data streams with concept drift.
