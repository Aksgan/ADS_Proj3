Since 1986 he has authored a series of highly influential papers which have inaugurated a fundamental shift in [[artificial intelligence]] research. Outside the scientific community Brooks is also known for his appearance in a film featuring him and his work, ''[[Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control]]''. ==Scientific approach: biologically-inspired robotics== In his classic paper, "[http://www.liralab.it/teaching/ROBOTICA/docs/brooks.1990.pdf Elephants Don't Play Chess.]", Brooks argued that interacting with the physical world is far more difficult than symbolically reasoning about it. [[Symbolic computation]]al approaches to creating intelligent machines had long been the focus of AI since the days of [[Alan Turing]], directly tracing back to the work of [[Gottlob Frege]]. Brooks focused instead on biologically-inspired robotic architectures (e.g., the [[subsumption architecture]]) that address basic perceptual and sensorimotor tasks. In the late [[1980s]] Brooks and his team introduced [[Allen (robot)|Allen]], a robot using [[subsumption architecture]]. Currently, Brooks' work focuses on engineering intelligent robots to operate in unstructured environments, and understanding human intelligence through building humanoid robots. ==Career summary== ===Leadership=== Brooks currently serves as Panasonic Professor of Robotics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He is [[Chief Technical Officer]] and sits on the Board of [[iRobot]] Corp. From July 1, 2003, until June 30, 2007, he was director of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]]; prior to that, he was director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. ===Research=== He received a degree in pure mathematics from [[Flinders University]] of South Australia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [[Stanford University]] in 1981 under the supervision of [[Thomas Binford]].<ref>{{mathgenealogy|name=Rodney Allan Brooks|id=61090}}.</ref> He has held research positions at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and a faculty position at [[Stanford University]]. He joined the faculty of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1984. His previous research includes [[behavior based robotics]] and the *[[Cog (project)|Cog project]]. ==Corporate spin-offs== He is founder and former Chief Technical Officer of [[iRobot]]<ref>http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/companies.html</ref> and co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of [[Heartland Robotics]]. ==Publications== The following is a list of some known noteworthy books and papers: *{{citation |=March 1986 |author=Rodney Brooks |title=A robust layered control system for a mobile robot |journal=IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=14–23}} *{{citation |year=1989 |author=Rodney Brooks |title=A Robot that Walks; Emergent Behaviors from a Carefully Evolved Network |journal=Neural Computation |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=253–262 |doi=10.1162/neco.1989.1.2.253 |url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/AIM-1091.pdf |accessdate=24 August 2010}} *{{citation |date=January 1991 |author=Rodney Brooks |title=Intelligence without representation |journal=Artificial Intelligence |volume=47 |issue=1-3 |pages=139–159 |doi=10.1016/0004-3702(91)90053-M }} *{{citation |year=1995 |editor=Steels, Luc & Brooks, Rodney |title=The Artificial Life Route to Artificial Intelligence: Building Embodied, Situated Agents |place=Hillsdale, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-8058-1519-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hh7x98OpzzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Rodney+Allen+Brooks%22&hl=en&ei=eYNzTM_EAoqGvAOQ4vzKDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=24 August 2010}} Alernative ISBN 0-8058-1518-X *{{citation |year=1996 |editor=Brooks, Rodney A., & Maes, Pattie |title=Artificial Life: Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-52190-3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8a6uC0BbyjAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Rodney+Allen+Brooks%22&hl=en&ei=eYNzTM_EAoqGvAOQ4vzKDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=24 August 2010}} *{{citation |year=1999 |author=Rodney Brooks |title=Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI |place= |publisher=MIT Press |isbn= 0-262-52263-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=btvRZ5rj51EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22cambrian+intelligence%22&hl=en&ei=qoJzTMzuAYnCvQPfk9XLDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=24 August 2010}} *[[Kevin Warwick|K.
