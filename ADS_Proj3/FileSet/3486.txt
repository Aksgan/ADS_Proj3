crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid-liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same [[symmetry group]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. The solid-liquid phase boundary in the phase diagram of most substances has a positive [[slope]]; the greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance's [[intermolecular forces]]. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid-gas phase changes.<ref name="chemistry1">{{cite book |title=Chemistry: The Study of Matter, Forth Edition |pages=266–273 |isbn=0-13-127333-7 |publisher=Prentice Hall}}</ref> Water, because of its particular properties, is one of the several exceptions to the rule. ; Other thermodynamic properties In addition to just temperature or pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams. Examples of such thermodynamic properties include [[specific volume]], [[specific enthalpy]], or specific [[entropy]]. For example, single-component graphs of Temperature vs. specific entropy (T vs. s) for water/[[steam]] or for a [[refrigerant]] are commonly used to illustrate [[thermodynamic cycle]]s such as a [[Carnot cycle]], [[Rankine cycle]], or [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle. In a [[two-dimensional graph]], two of the thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical axes. Additional thermodymic quantities may each be illustrated in increments as a series of lines - curved, straight, or a combination of curved and straight. Each of these '''iso-'''lines represents the thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.

'''86''' (5), 566 (May 2009)].</ref> For example for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (T) on one axis, pressure (P) on a second axis, and specific volume (v) on a third. Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a P-v-T diagram. The equilibrium conditions would be shown as a 3D curved surface with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a '''triple line''' is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram. An [[orthographic projection]] of the 3D P-v-T graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes effectively collapses the 3D plot into a 2D pressure-temperature diagram. When this happens, the solid-vapor, solid-liquid, and liquid-vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line. ===Binary phase diagrams=== Other much more complex types of phase diagrams can be constructed, particularly when more than one pure component is present. In that case [[concentration]] becomes an important variable. Phase diagrams with more than two dimensions can be constructed that show the effect of more than two variables on the phase of a substance. Phase diagrams can use other variables in addition to or in place of temperature, pressure and composition, for example the strength of an applied electrical or magnetic field and they can also involve substances that take on more than just three states of matter.

Such a mixture can be either a [[solid solution]], [[eutectic point|eutectic]] or [[peritectic]], among others. These two types of mixtures result in very different graphs. Another type of binary phase diagram is a ''boiling point diagram'' for a mixture of two components, i. e. [[chemical compound]]s. For two particular [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components at a certain pressure such as [[atmospheric pressure]], a boiling point diagram shows what [[vapor]] (gas) compositions are in [[Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium|equilibrium]] with given liquid compositions depending on temperature. In a typical binary boiling point diagram, temperature is plotted on a vertical axis and mixture composition on a horizontal axis.

The fact that there are two separate curved lines joining the boiling points of the pure components means that the vapor composition
