The Wikimedia chapters, local associations of users and supporters of the Wikimedia projects, also participate in the promotion, the development, and the funding of the project. === Software and hardware === The operation of Wikipedia depends on [[MediaWiki]], a custom-made, [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] [[wiki software]] platform written in [[PHP]] and built upon the [[MySQL]] database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nedworks.org/~mark/presentations/san/Wikimedia%20architecture.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikimedia Architecture |author=Mark Bergman |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc. |accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> The software incorporates programming features such as a [[Macro (computer science)|macro language]], [[variable (programming)|variables]], a [[transclusion]] system for [[Web template|templates]], and [[URL redirection]]. MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]]. Several MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Version#Installed_extensions |title=Version: Installed extensions}}</ref> to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software. In April 2005 a [[Lucene]] extension<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-04-18/Lucene_search |title=Lucene search: Internal search function returns to service |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc.|author=Michael Snow|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2005-April/016297.html |title=[Wikitech-l&#93; Lucene search|author=Brion Vibber|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from [[MySQL]] to Lucene for searching.

In January 2005, the project ran on 39 [[Dedicated hosting service|dedicated servers]] in Florida. This configuration included a single master [[database server]] running [[MySQL]], multiple slave database servers, 21 [[web server]]s running the [[Apache HTTP Server]], and seven [[Squid (software)|Squid cache]] servers. Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.<ref>"[[tools:~leon/stats/reqstats/reqstats-monthly.png|Monthly request statistics]]," Wikimedia.

The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. Two larger clusters in the Netherlands and Korea now handle much of Wikipedia's traffic load. === Mobile access{{anchor|Wikipedia mobile access|Wikipedia mobile}} === Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard [[web browser]] through a fixed [[internet access|internet connection]]. However, Wikipedia content is now also accessible through the [[mobile web]]. Access to Wikipedia from [[mobile phone]]s was possible as early as 2004, through the [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP), via the [[Wapedia]] service. In June 2007, Wikipedia launched [http://en.mobile.wikipedia.org/ en.mobile.wikipedia.org], an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,<ref>{{cite web|title=Wikimedia Mobile is Officially Launched|url=http://techblog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/wikimedia-mobile-launch/|date=2009-06-30|work=Wikimedia Technical Blog|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> located at [http://en.m.wikipedia.org/ en.m.wikipedia.org], which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based devices, or the [[Palm Pre]]. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged (See {{srlink|Help:Mobile access}}). Several devices and applications optimise or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia [[metadata]] (See {{srlink|Wikipedia:Metadata}}), such as [[geoinformation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/15802/ |title=iPhone Gems: Wikipedia Apps |date=30 November 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2008 }}</ref> == Language editions == {{See also|List of Wikipedias}} [[File:PercentWikipediasGraph.png|thumb|right|Percentage of all Wikipedia articles in English (red) and top ten largest language editions (blue).
