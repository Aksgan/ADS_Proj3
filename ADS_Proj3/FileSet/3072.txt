chipset shipped in 3 varieties; '''220''', '''415''', and '''420'''. 220 and 420 are very similar with each having the integrated [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], but the 220 only has a single channel of memory available whereas 420 has the 128-bit '''TwinBank''' design. The 415 variant again has the dual-channel memory interface, but has no integrated graphics. ==Innovations== ===Dual Channel & GeForce2 MX IGP=== The nForce chipset introduced a dual-channel memory controller to the mainstream motherboard market, doubling theoretical throughput, and offering very competitive performance most especially in workstation class [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]]. This dual-channel design was deemed necessary largely because of the added integrated [[GeForce 2 Series|GeForce 2 MX]] class video hardware. For the relatively fast integrated graphics processor (IGP) to have adequate memory bandwidth it needed more than to simply share a single memory channel with the Athlon XP CPU. In fact, the K7's EV6 CPU bus was unable to take advantage of more than a single-channel DDR memory interface because the [[Front-side bus]] bandwidth was equal to this. So, the second channel of the ''TwinBank'' boards went almost entirely to the IGP. ===Ethernet and DASP=== Nvidia also touted both their built-in [[Ethernet]] controller, and a new memory prefetch mechanism called the '''Dynamic Adaptive Speculative Pre-Processor''' (DASP). The Nvidia-built Ethernet controller was supposedly capable of reducing CPU overhead while being also very fast. The DASP unit helped reduce memory latency for the main CPU by prefetching often needed data, or data that the DASP predicted the CPU would need. Many considered it sort of an advanced Level 3 [[cache memory|cache]] device.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} ===nForce APU (SoundStorm) === {{main|SoundStorm}} Nvidia debuted their advanced NVAPU audio solution, branded '''SoundStorm''', on the nForce MCP-D southbridge chip. It is the same as the audio processor in the [[Xbox]] chipset and supports many hardware-accelerated 2D/3D audio channels and advanced [[Head-related transfer function|HRTF]] 3D audio spatialization. It also has a built-in processor for encoding computer audio into a [[Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital Live]] signal for external receivers to decode into a 5.1-channel audio spread. With its hardware acceleration, the difference in CPU usage when running popular multimedia applications was as much as 10-20%, potentially allowing faster performance in programs that are limited by the system CPU. ==Performance and Issues== The original nForce chipset was let down by patchy driver support and less than optimal hardware design. Performance of the dual-channel memory controller and "DASP" did not greatly surpass the [[VIA Technologies]] KT266A chipset that was usually as fast and cheaper. The optimized [[AT Attachment|parallel ATA]] driver support was introduced and then withdrawn after hardware incompatibilities showed up, and the much heralded [[SoundStorm]] audio was seen to crackle under heavily loaded scenarios. In fact, the ATA driver would remain an issue at least into the life of [[nForce4]] where it was still known to cause problems with some [[hard drive]]s and [[optical drive]]s. Still, considering nForce was Nvidia's first foray into the chipset market, it was considered a success if only because it was able to be competitive on performance, reliability, and stability with veterans such as VIA, SiS, and Intel. ==See also== * [[Comparison of Nvidia chipsets]] ==External links== * [http://www.nvidia.com/page/mobo.html Nvidia's nForce product page] * [http://www.nvidia.com/object/nppa.html NVIDIA nForce Platform Processors] * [http://www.nvidia.com/page/technology_vista_mcp.html Nvidia - Windows Vista Capable nForce MCPs] * [http://www.nforcershq.com nForcersHQ]: nForce chipset community forum/website * [http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=1484 Anandtech: Nvidia nForce Computex 2001 Preview] * [http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=1535 Anandtech: Nvidia's nForce 420/220: It's finally here] {{Nvidia}} [[Category:Motherboard]] [[Category:Nvidia]] [[de:Nvidia nForce]] [[fr:NForce]] [[ko:엔포스]] [[no:NForce]] [[pl:NForce]] [[pt:NForce]] [[fi:NForce]] [[zh:NVIDIA nForce]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25614</id> <title>NForce3</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=nForce3}} {| align=right class="wikitable" !colspan=2 align=right|[[Nvidia]] nForce3 |- |colspan=2|[[Image:NForce3.jpg|160px|Nvidia nForce3 logo]] |- !CPU support |[[Athlon 64]], [[Sempron]] |- !Predecessor |[[nForce2]] |- !Successor |[[nForce4]] |} The '''nForce3''' chipset was created by [[Nvidia]] as a [[Media and Communications Processor]]. Specifically, it was designed for use with the [[Athlon 64]] processor. == Features of the nForce3 == When the Athlon 64 was launched, the Nvidia '''nForce3 Pro150''' and [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] K8T800 were the only two chipsets available. The 150 chipset was widely criticized at launch for using a 600 MHz [[HyperTransport]] interface, when VIA had implemented the full AMD specification at 800 MHz, even though overall performance of the 150 was still good. Later revisions fixed this omission, and using a HyperTransport interface, the nForce3 chipset is able to communicate at up to 8 GB/s with the CPU. This reduces system bottlenecks when using high-bandwidth devices. For example, the Gigabit Ethernet transmits at 100 MB/s; if the Ethernet were not on the chipset, a saturated gigabit Ethernet link would use 75% of the bandwidth of the 133 MB/s PCI bus. The 150 also noticeably lacked features. Subsequent revisions of the chipset corrected these omissions. The chipset is offered in different versions, reflecting socket types and features. *'''nForce3 250''' - [[Socket 754]], basic value chipset, 800HT, does not include on-chip Gigabit LAN or on-chip Firewall. *'''nForce3 250Gb''' - Socket 754 or 939, 800HT, includes gigabit LAN and on-chip Firewall. *'''nForce3 Ultra''' - [[Socket 939]], 1000HT, gigabit LAN, Firewall, Dual-Channel unbuffered, for Athlon 64/Athlon 64 FX. *'''nForce3 Pro250''' - [[Socket 940]], 1000HT, gigabit LAN, Firewall, for Opteron. Perhaps most notably, the 250 revision of the nForce 3 featured the world’s first native [[Gigabit Ethernet]] interface and a hardware-optimized Firewall. The Nvidia Firewall technology utilizes the [[ActiveArmor]] secure networking engine. This makes the firewall an on-chip function, in theory reducing the overhead on the CPU and increasing throughput. The firewall also uses IAM, or Intelligent Application Manager, to provide application-based filtering. However, the most notable omission from the nForce 3 chipset is the quality integrated [[SoundStorm]] audio found in [[nForce2]] boards, supposedly for cost reasons. The nForce 3 chipset is a single die solution, as opposed to the historical [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] / [[Southbridge (computing)|southbridge]] combination, and reportedly there was not enough space left for audio functionality. The nForce3 also supports [[SATA]] technology, as well as [[redundant array of independent disks|RAID]] 0+1 striping and mirroring. The chipset can accommodate up to four high bandwidth SATA-150 devices. ==Windows Vista Incompatibility== Nvidia announced before the public release
