the pad, letting go of the touchpad will switch back to the default mouse-mode. == Other applications == In many applications (e.g. [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]]<ref name="FF_shortcuts">[http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Page%20Zoom Mozilla.com]</ref>, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and [[Google Chrome]]), holding down the [[control key]] while rolling the scroll wheel causes the [[Plain text|text]] size to increase or decrease, or an image in an image-editing or map-viewing program to [[zoom]] in or out, if such a feature is available. In many [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) games, the scroll wheel is usually set to change weapons. It is also sometimes used to control the zoom of scoped weapons and binoculars. FPS games with an emphasis on realism may choose to use the wheel for changing between stances. Since the introduction of tilting scroll-wheels, many FPS games use the left-right motion of the scroll wheel to cause the player to lean left and right. A less common use is to use the mouse wheel to adjust the player's speed of movement. [[Real time strategy]] games use the mouse wheel to change the altitude of the camera. Many RTS games also allow control of the camera with the scroll wheel button held down causing the view to either tilt or pan with mouse movement. == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Pointing devices]] [[Category:User interface techniques]] [[Category:American inventions]] {{computer-stub}} [[de:Jog Dial]] [[fr:Molette de souris]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33460</id> <title>Scrum (development)</title> <text>[[File:Scrum process.svg|thumb|400px|right|The Scrum process.]] {{Software development process}} '''Scrum''' is an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative, incremental]] methodology for project management often seen in [[agile software development]], a type of [[software engineering]]. Although Scrum was intended for management of software development projects, it can be used to run software maintenance teams, or as a general project/program management approach. == History == In 1986, [[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] described a new [[holistic]] approach that would increase speed and flexibility in commercial [[new product development]].<ref name='Takeuchi'>{{cite journal|url=http://hbr.org/product/new-new-product-development-game/an/86116-PDF-ENG|format=PDF|title=The New New Product Development Game|last=Takeuchi|first=Hirotaka|authorlink=Hirotaka Takeuchi|coauthors=Nonaka, Ikujiro|journal=Harvard Business Review|year=1986|month=January–February|accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref> They compared this new, holistic approach, in which the phases strongly overlap and the whole process is performed by one cross-functional team across the different phases, to [[rugby union|rugby]], where the whole team "tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth". The case studies came from the automotive, photo machine, computer, and printer industries.<ref name='Takeuchi'/> In 1991, [[Peter DeGrace|DeGrace]] and [[Leslie Hulet Stahl|Stahl]], in "Wicked Problems, Righteous Solutions",<ref>{{cite book|title=Wicked problems, righteous solutions|last=DeGrace|first=Peter|coauthors=Stahl, Leslie Hulet|date=1990-10-01|isbn=978-0-135-90126-7|publisher=Prentice Hall}}</ref> referred to this approach as [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]], a rugby term mentioned in the article by Takeuchi and Nonaka. In the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used an approach that led to Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods. At the same time, [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales, and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation and were the first to call it Scrum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/35|format=PDF|title=Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last=Sutherland|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Sutherland|month=October|date=2004-10|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> In 1995, [[Jeff Sutherland|Sutherland]] and [[Ken Schwaber|Schwaber]] jointly presented a paper describing Scrum at the Business Object Design and Implementation workshop held as part of [[OOPSLA|OOPSLA ’95]] in Austin, Texas, its first public appearance. Schwaber and Sutherland collaborated during the following years to merge the above writings, their experiences, and industry best practices into what is now known as Scrum. In 2001, Schwaber teamed up with Mike Beedle to describe the method in the book "Agile Software Development with Scrum". Although the word is not an [[acronym]], some companies implementing the process have been known to spell it with capital letters as SCRUM. This may be due to one of [[Ken Schwaber]]’s early papers, which capitalized SCRUM in the title.<ref name="schwaber">{{cite book|title=Agile Project Management with Scrum|last= Schwaber|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Schwaber|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-0-735-61993-7|date=1 February 2004}}</ref> == Characteristics == '''Scrum''' is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles. The main roles in Scrum are: # the “'''ScrumMaster'''”, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a [[project manager]]) # the “'''Product Owner'''”, who represents the stakeholders and the business # the “'''Team'''”, a cross-functional group of about 7 people who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc. During each “[[sprint (software development)|sprint]]”, typically a two to four week period (with the length being decided by the team), the team creates a potentially shippable product increment (for example, working and tested software). The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product “backlog”, which is a prioritized set of high level requirements of work to be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the Product Owner informs the team of the items in the product backlog that he or she wants completed. The team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during the next sprint, and records this in the sprint backlog.<ref name="schwaber" /> During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, which means that the [[requirement]]s are frozen for that sprint. Development is [[timeboxing|timebox]]ed such that the sprint must end on time; if requirements are not completed for any reason they are left out and returned to the product backlog. After a sprint is completed, the team demonstrates how to use the software. Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project. A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team’s ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements. Like other agile development methodologies, Scrum can be implemented through a wide range of tools. Many companies use universal software tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages dedicated
