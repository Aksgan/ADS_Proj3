case which add subtle aesthetics to an otherwise plain looking case; this is also done for practical purposes such as to make a computer double as a night light. Internal components, such power supplies, are often available with built in lighting. *'''Cooling mods''': There are many modifications that can fall into this category. The most common one is simply drilling a mount for a new fan<ref>{{cite web | publisher = LegitReviews.com | title = Case Mod-Fans | url = http://forums.legitreviews.com/about19907.html | accessdate = 2009-05-07 }}</ref>, or removing a restrictive fan grill. Others include air ducts, water cooling<ref>{{cite web | publisher = www.techPowerUp.com | title = Case Mod Gallery | url = http://www.techpowerup.com/gallery/ | accessdate = 2009-05-07 }}</ref>, filtering, sealing openings to promote better air flow, or even the adding of a tank of pressurized [[carbon dioxide]] or liters of [[mineral oil]] to the case. These modifications are often performed by [[Overclocking|overclockers]] either looking for better cooling for hot components or [[Quiet PC|sound reduction]]. Some fan modifications are merely a show of modding skill or talent and have no true functional purpose.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Weblogs, Inc | title = 66-fan case mod exemplifies overkill | url = http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/25/66-fan-case-mod-exemplifies-overkill/ | accessdate = 2009-05-07 }}</ref> *'''Spray paint''': Painting a case is another method of distinguishing your work from others. [[Spray paint]] is the common method preferred among amateur modders.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Rob 'linear' Arnold | title = case mod 101: how to paint your computer case | url = http://case-mods.linear1.org/case-mod-101-how-to-paint-your-computer-case-part-1/ | accessdate = 2009-05-07 }}</ref> There are many spray painting guides for amateur modders. The finish cannot be compared to automotive paint or [[powder coating]], but is a simple way to change the look of a case. ==Less common modifications== [[Image:Saibotcaseside.jpg|left|thumbnail|A computer modded with different coloured [[CCFL]]s and [[LED]] fans. ]] *'''Automotive paint & other finishes''': Automotive paint refers to the paint typically seen on cars and trucks. This type of finish requires a compressed air source, such as an [[air compressor]] or [[CO2]] tank, and a [[spray gun]]. It is more expensive than a finish using [[Aerosol paint|spray cans]], but when done skillfully it can be better looking and much more durable. Other methods of painting can include [[powder coating]] which is highly durable though not quite as aesthetically pleasing to many modders as automotive paint. [[Electroplating]] can also be done on steel computer cases and parts. Aluminum cases can be plated or [[Anodizing|anodized]] as well, and processes are available to plate plastic cases. Plated coatings can range from nickel to chrome and even gold. More elaborate finishes can be crafted by using a combination of techniques, such as chrome plating with a transparent color coat. *'''Body filler''': Body filler (or [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]]) is a two-part putty often used to fix dents in automobiles. Case modders use it to fill and sculpt their own creations. When mixed with a paste catalyst the filler hardens in a short period of time and can be sanded, ground or cut to a desired shape. An alternative system uses [[fiberglass]] resin (catalyzed with liquid hardener) and either fiberglass cloth or mat to fill holes and form shapes. Lacquer based Spot Putty is often used to fill smaller imperfections before the application of [[Primer (paint)|primer]]. Typically, a case modder uses a combination of these materials to obtain the desired result. This method is usually used on the front plastic bezel of a computer case to give it a new look. ==Types of case mods== [[Image:Casemodding microwave.JPG|thumb|300px|Computer built into a [[Microwave oven]]]] *'''Peripheral mods''': [[Peripheral]]s like the keyboard, mouse, and speakers are sometimes painted or otherwise modified to match the computer. Some system builders, in an effort to make their system more portable and convenient, install speakers and small [[LCD]] screens into the case. *'''Unusual cooling mods''': Hardcore [[Overclocking|overclockers]] often install cooling systems for the sole purpose of achieving performance records.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Such systems frequently include [[phase change]], [[Thermoelectric effect#Peltier effect|thermoelectric/Peltier]] and [[liquid nitrogen]]. However, some of these systems are noisy and expensive. They are rarely used for extended periods of time. *'''Case building''': Sometime modders even build entire cases from scratch. Some may attempt to treat the case as a work of [[art]]. Others make it appear to be something else, like a teddy bear, wooden cabinet, or a shelf mounted on a wall. Still others pursue a retro look, like a [[Macintosh Plus]] or an old [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]]. Case [[modders]] (or case builders) who create their computer cases from scratch are few and far between. These people sometimes put hundreds of hours into their work. The [http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2006/05/22/wmd_part2_g-gnome_case_mod/1.html WMD case], [http://www.thebestcasescenario.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28&page=6 Project Nighthawk], and [http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=76374&page=1&pp=20 Dark Blade case] are a few examples of professional cases built from scratch. *'''Component modding''': This type of modding, as the name suggests, involves modifying the PC components themselves. An example is the relocation of buttons on optical drives. This is often done in combination with "stealthing", which hides the drive's visibility by masking it with a blank face. A riskier modification involves installing [[hard drive]] windows. This is done in a clean room where there is little to no dust. Few people have attempted it and results seem to vary. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Some hard drives, including the [[WD Raptor]], now come with a window as standard. *'''Laptop modding''': [[Laptop]]s can be modified much like a typical computer case. While most laptop mods consist of new paint or other finishes, others have chosen to engrave or cut out designs into their laptop cover (behind the screen). Laptops may also be turned into [[digital photo frame]]s. These types of mods will typically void the warranty of the device. To avoid warranty issues, skins or stickers can be purchased that are easily removable from the casing. ==Case modding contests== Many sites and companies run contests for case modders, awarding prizes and accolades to the winners. Some of these contests are sponsored by computer enthusiast magazines and others by computer retailers. ==Console case modding== [[File:Gold Xbox.jpg|thumb|300px|An
