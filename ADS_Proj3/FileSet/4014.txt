The Zaurus was the most popular PDA during the 1990s in [[Japan]] and was based on a proprietary [[operating system]]. The first Sharp PDA to use the [[Linux]] operating system was the SL-5000D, running the [[Qtopia]]-based [[Embedix]] Plus. The name derives from the common suffix applied to the names of [[dinosaur]]s, and was chosen to convey the idea of strength.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} == History == In September 1993, Sharp introduced the PI-3000, the first in the Zaurus line of PDAs, as a follow-on to Sharp's earlier Wizard line of PDAs (the Wizard also influenced Apple's Newton). Featuring a black and white [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen, [[handwriting recognition]], and optical communication capabilities among its features, the Zaurus soon became one of Sharp's flagship products. The PI-4000, released in 1994, expanded the Zaurus' features with a built-in [[modem]] and [[fax|facsimile]] functions. This was succeeded in 1995 by the PI-5000, which had [[e-mail]] and [[mobile phone]] interfaces, as well as PC linking capability. The Zaurus K-PDA was the first Zaurus to have a built-in keyboard in addition to handwriting recognition; the PI-6000 and PI-7000 brought in additional improvements. In 1996 Sharp introduced the Sharp Zaurus ZR-5800. It used the same compact design, ports and pointing device as the previous Zaurus models. The changes were mostly in the ROM. It came with 2 MB RAM and a backlit 320x240 LCD display.[http://www.pencomputing.com/archive/PCM_10/zaurus_review.html] During this time, Sharp was making significant advances in color LCD technology. In May 1996, the first color Zaurus was released; the MI-10 and MI-10DC were equipped with a five inch (12.7 cm) color [[thin-film transistor]] (TFT) LCD screen. This model had the ability to connect to the internet, and had a built-in camera and audio recorder. Later that year, Sharp developed a forty inch (100 cm) TFT LCD screen, the world's largest at the time. In December, the MI-10/10DC Zaurus was chosen as the year's best product by Information Display Magazine in the [[United States]]. Sharp continued to make advancements in display technology; the Zaurus gained additional multimedia capabilities, such as video playback, with the introduction of the MI-E1 in Japan in November 2000. The MI-E1 was also the first Zaurus to support both [[Secure Digital card|Secure Digital]] and [[CompactFlash]] memory cards, a feature which would become standard on future models as well. Although the MI series was extremely popular in Japan, it was never released in either the USA or Europe - probably largely due to the strictly Japanese UI, which was never translated into any other language. As a result, the machines released outside Japan were the [[Linux]] based SL series, the first of which was the SL-5000D "developer edition." This was shortly followed by the SL-5500; both used 'Embedix' - an embedded version of the [[Linux]] operating system developed by Lineo - combined with [[Qtopia]], the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt toolkit]]-based embedded application environment developed by [[Trolltech]]. The development of the MI series in Japan was continued for a while, but the MI-E25DC has been officially declared to be the last MI-Series Zaurus. Sharp has continued development of the SL series in Japan releasing the SL-C700, C750, C760 and C860 models which all feature 640x480 [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] screen resolution. They are all based on faster 400 MHz [[Intel]] [[Intel XScale|XScale]] technology, although the SL-C700 was flawed and the apparent speed was the same as the 206 MHz SL-5500. All four of the SL-C models are clamshell type devices with the unusual ability to rotate the screen. This allows the device to be used in 'landscape' mode with the keyboard, much like a miniature notebook PC, or in 'portrait' mode as a PDA. Sharp introduced a very different device from the clamshells in the form of the SL-6000 in early 2004; the SL-6000L ([[Wi-Fi]] only, no [[Bluetooth]]) was sold in North America, the last and only device since the 5xxx series to be officially sold outside Japan. It returned to the slider form of the 5xxx, but with a VGA display; a slider with a few key buttons covered a [[thumbboard]]. It appears that there was a joint project with IBM, which sadly (but with no official news either way) failed; the 6000 did not gain mass popularity and Amazon sold off their remaindered stock cheaply. In October 2004 Sharp announced the SL-C3000 - the world's first PDA with an integrated hard disk drive (preceding the Palm Life Drive which attempted to claim that crown). It featured a similar hardware and software specification to the earlier C860 model; the key differences were that it only had 16 MB of flash memory yet gained an internal 4 GB microdrive (Hitachi) instead, a USB Host port, and "lost" the serial port (in some cases the components were not fitted to the motherboard or were incapable of driving the regular serial adaptor cables). The keyboard feel and layout
