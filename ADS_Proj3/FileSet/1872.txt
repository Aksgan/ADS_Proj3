Driven by areal density doubling every two to four years since their invention, HDDs have changed in many ways, a few highlights include: <!-- If you change any one bullet below, please make sure you change all related values.

Sequential changes in the direction of magnetization represent patterns of binary data bits. The data are read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization and decoding the originally written data. Different encoding schemes, such as [[Modified Frequency Modulation]], [[group code recording]], [[run-length limited]] encoding, and others are used. A typical HDD design consists of a [[spindle (computer)|spindle]] that holds flat circular disks called [[hard disk platter|platters]], onto which the data are recorded. The platters are made from a non-magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy or glass, and are coated with a shallow layer of magnetic material typically 10–20 [[nanometer|nm]] in depth, with an outer layer of carbon for protection.

In this case the binary data are encoded using [[frequency modulation]].]] [[File:Perpendicular Recording Diagram.svg|thumb|right|Perpendicular recording]] The platters are spun at speeds varying from 3,000 [[RPM]] in energy-efficient portable devices, to 15,000 RPM for high performance servers. Information is written to, and read from a platter as it rotates past devices called [[disk read-and-write head|read-and-write head]]s that operate very close (tens of nanometers in new drives) over the magnetic surface. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material immediately under it. In modern drives there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a [[voice coil]] actuator or in some older designs a [[stepper motor]]. The magnetic surface of each platter is conceptually divided into many small sub-[[micrometer]]-sized magnetic regions referred to as [[magnetic domains]]. In older disk designs the regions were oriented horizontally and parallel to the disk surface, but beginning about 2005, the orientation was changed to [[perpendicular recording|perpendicular]] to allow for closer magnetic domain spacing. Due to the [[polycrystal]]line nature of the magnetic material each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic [[crystallite|grains]]. Magnetic grains are typically 10 nm in size and each form a single [[Magnetic domains|magnetic domain]]. Each magnetic region in total forms a [[magnetic dipole]] which generates a [[magnetic field]]. For reliable storage of data, the recording material needs to resist self-demagnetization, which occurs when the magnetic domains repel each other. Magnetic domains written too densely together to a weakly magnetizable material will degrade over time due to physical rotation of one or more domains to cancel out these forces. The domains rotate sideways to a halfway position that weakens the readability of the domain and relieves the magnetic stresses. Older hard disks used [[iron(III) oxide]] as the magnetic material, but current disks use a [[cobalt]]-based alloy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/a-divide-over-the-future-of-hard-drives-39393818.htm|title=A divide over the future of hard drives|author=Kanellos, Michael|publisher=CNETNews.com|date=2006-08-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> A write head magnetizes a region by generating a strong local magnetic field. Early HDDs used an [[electromagnet]] both to magnetize the region and to then read its magnetic field by using [[electromagnetic induction]]. Later versions of inductive heads included metal in Gap (MIG) heads and [[thin film]] heads. As data density increased, read heads using [[magnetoresistance]] (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according to the strength of the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of [[spintronics]]; in these heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [[giant magnetoresistance|"giant" magnetoresistance]] (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically [[giant magnetoresistance|magneto-resistive]] while the write element is typically thin-film inductive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.hitachigst.com/hdd/technolo/gmr/gmr.htm|title=IBM OEM MR Head &#124; Technology &#124; The era of giant magnetoresistive heads |publisher=Hitachigst.com|date=2001-08-27|accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> The heads are kept from contacting the platter surface by the air that is extremely close to the platter; that air
