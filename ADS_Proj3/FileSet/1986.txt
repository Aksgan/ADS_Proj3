The '''thin homoeoid''' is then given by the limit <math> m \to 1 </math> ==Physical meaning== A homoeoid can be used as a construction element of a matter or charge distribution. The gravitational or electromagnetic [[potential]] of a homoeoid homogeneously filled with matter or charge is constant inside the shell. This means that a test mass or charge will not feel any force inside the shell. ==References== *[[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]]: ''Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium'', Yale Univ.

A special case of this is when the topological group, ''G'', in question is the [[homeomorphism group]] of the space, ''X''. In this case ''X'' is homogeneous if intuitively ''X'' looks locally the same everywhere. Some authors insist that the action of ''G'' be [[effective group action|effective]] (i.e. faithful), although the present article does not. Thus there is a [[group action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' which can be thought of as preserving some "geometric structure" on ''X'', and making ''X'' into a single [[orbit (group theory)|''G''-orbit]]. ==Formal definition== Let ''X'' be a non-empty set and ''G'' a group. Then ''X'' is called a ''G''-space if it is equipped with an action of ''G'' on ''X''.<ref>We assume that the action is on the ''left''. The distinction is only important in the description of ''X'' as a coset space.</ref> Note that automatically ''G'' acts by automorphisms (bijections) on the set. If ''X'' in addition belongs to some [[category (mathematics)|category]], then the elements of ''G'' are assumed to act as [[automorphism]]s in the same category. Thus the maps on ''X'' effected by ''G'' are structure preserving. A homogeneous space is a ''G''-space on which ''G'' acts transitively. Succinctly, if ''X'' is an object of the category '''C''', then the structure of a ''G''-space is a [[homomorphism]]: <math>\rho : G \to \mathrm{Aut}_{\mathbf{C}}(X)</math> into the group of [[automorphism]]s of the object ''X'' in the category '''C'''. The pair (''X'',ρ) defines a homogeneous space provided ρ(''G'') is a transitive group of symmetries of the underlying set of ''X''. ===Examples=== For example, if ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then group elements are assumed to act as [[homeomorphism]]s on ''X''. The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Homeo(''X'') into the [[homeomorphism group]] of ''X''. Similarly, if ''X'' is a [[differentiable manifold]], then the group elements are [[diffeomorphism]]s. The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Diffeo(''X'') into the diffeomorphism group of ''X''. ==Geometry== From the point of view of the [[Erlangen programme]], one may understand that "all points are the same", in the [[geometry]] of ''X''. This was true of essentially all geometries proposed before [[Riemannian geometry]], in the middle of the nineteenth century. Thus, for example, [[Euclidean space]], [[affine space]] and [[projective space]] are all in natural ways homogeneous spaces for their respective [[symmetry group]]s. The same is true of the models found of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], of constant [[curvature]], such as [[hyperbolic space]]. A further classical example is the space of lines in projective space of three dimensions (equivalently, the space of two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional [[vector space]]). It is simple linear algebra to show that GL<sub>4</sub> acts transitively on those. We can parameterize them by ''line co-ordinates'': these are the 2×2 [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the 2×4 matrix with columns two basis vectors for the subspace. The geometry of the resulting homogeneous space is the [[line geometry]] of [[Julius Plücker]]. ==Homogeneous spaces as coset spaces== In general, if ''X'' is a homogeneous space, and ''H''<sub>''o''</sub> is the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of some marked point ''o'' in ''X'' (a choice of [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]), the points of ''X'' correspond to the left [[coset]]s ''G''/''H''<sub>''o''</sub>. In general, a different choice of origin ''o'' will lead to a quotient of ''G'' by a different subgroup ''H''<sub>o&prime;</sub> which is related to ''H''<sub>o</sub> by an [[inner automorphism]] of ''G''. Specifically, :<math>H_{o'} = gH_og^{-1}</math> (1) where ''g'' is any element of ''G'' for which ''go'' = ''o''&prime;. Note that the inner automorphism (1) does not depend on which such ''g'' is selected; it depends only on ''g'' modulo ''H''<sub>''o''</sub>. If the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is continuous, then ''H'' is a [[closed subgroup]] of ''G''. In particular, if ''G'' is a [[Lie group]], then ''H'' is a closed [[Lie subgroup]] by [[Cartan's theorem]]. Hence ''G''/''H'' is a [[smooth manifold]] and so ''X'' carries a unique [[smooth structure]] compatible with the group action. If ''H'' is the identity subgroup {''e''}, then ''X'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]]. One can go further to [[double coset|''double'' coset]] spaces, notably [[Clifford–Klein form]]s ''Γ''\''G''/''H'', where ''Γ'' is a discrete subgroup (of ''G'') acting [[properly discontinuously]]. ==Example== For example in the line geometry case, we can identify H as a 12-dimensional subgroup of the 16-dimensional [[general linear group]] :''GL''<sub>4</sub>, defined by conditions on the matrix entries :h<sub>13</sub> = h<sub>14</sub> = h<sub>23</sub> = h<sub>24</sub> = 0, by looking for the stabilizer of the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis vectors. That shows that X has dimension 4. Since the [[homogeneous coordinates]] given by the minors are 6 in number, this means that the latter are not independent of each other. In fact a single quadratic relation holds between the six minors, as was known to nineteenth-century geometers. This example was the first known example of a [[Grassmannian]], other than a projective space. There are many further homogeneous spaces of the classical linear groups in common use in mathematics. ==Prehomogeneous vector spaces== The idea of a [[prehomogeneous vector space]] was introduced by [[Mikio Sato]]. It is a finite-dimensional [[vector
