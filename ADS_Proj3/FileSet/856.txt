such software is performed using a [[wind tunnel]] with the final validation coming in [[flight test]]s. ==Background and history== [[Image:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the [[Space Shuttle]] during re-entry.]] [[Image:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|right|A simulation of the [[Hyper-X]] scramjet vehicle in operation at [[Mach number|Mach]]-7]] The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems are the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], which define any single-phase fluid flow. These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing viscosity to yield the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. Further simplification, by removing terms describing vorticity yields the [[full potential equation]]s. Finally, these equations can be linearized to yield the [[linearized potential equations]]. Historically, methods were first developed to solve the Linearized Potential equations. Two-dimensional methods, using conformal transformations of the flow about a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] to the flow about an [[airfoil]] were developed in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Milne-Thomson|first=L.M.|title=Theoretical Aerodynamics|year=1973|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=048661980X}}</ref> The computer power available paced development of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] methods. The first paper on a practical three-dimensional method to solve the linearized potential equations was published by John Hess and [[A.M.O. Smith]] of [[Douglas Aircraft]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=J.L.|coauthors=A.M.O.

Their method itself was simplified, in that it did not include lifting flows and hence was mainly applied to ship hulls and aircraft fuselages. The first lifting Panel Code (A230) was described in a paper written by Paul Rubbert and Gary Saaris of Boeing Aircraft in 1968. In time, more advanced three-dimensional Panel Codes were developed at [[Boeing]] (PANAIR, A502), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] (Quadpan), [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] (HESS), [[McDonnell Aircraft]] (MACAERO), [[NASA]] (PMARC) and Analytical Methods (WBAERO, USAERO and VSAERO). Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel. The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time. Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many [[submarine]]s, surface [[ship]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[helicopter]]s , [[aircraft]], and more recently [[wind turbines]]. Its sister code, USAERO is an unsteady panel method that has also been used for modeling such things as high speed trains and racing [[yacht]]s. The NASA PMARC code from an early version of VSAERO and a derivative of PMARC, named CMARC, is also commercially available. In the two-dimensional realm, a number of Panel Codes have been developed for airfoil analysis and design. The codes typically have a [[boundary layer]] analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled. Professor [[Richard Eppler]] of the [[University of Stuttgart]] developed the [[PROFIL]] code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s. This was soon followed by [[MIT]] Professor Mark Drela's [[XFOIL]] code. Both PROFIL and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work. PROFIL uses a [[conformal transformation]] method for inverse airfoil design, while XFOIL has both a conformal transformation and an inverse panel method for airfoil design. Both codes are used. An intermediate step between Panel Codes and Full Potential codes were codes that used the Transonic Small Disturbance equations. In particular, the three-dimensional WIBCO code, developed by Charlie Boppe of [[Grumman Aircraft]] in the early 1980s has seen heavy use. Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at [[transonic]] speeds. The first description of a means of using the Full Potential equations was published by Earll Murman and [[Julian Cole]] of Boeing in 1970. Frances Bauer, [[Paul Garabedian]] and [[David Korn (computer scientist)|David Korn]] of the Courant Institute at [[New York University]] (NYU) wrote a series of two-dimensional Full Potential airfoil codes that were widely used, the most important being named Program H. A further growth of Program H was developed by Bob Melnik and his group at [[Grumman Aerospace]] as Grumfoil. [[Antony Jameson]], originally at Grumman Aircraft and the Courant Institute of NYU, worked with David Caughey to develop the important three-dimensional Full Potential code FLO22 in 1975. Many Full Potential codes emerged after this, culminating in Boeing's Tranair (A633) code, which still sees heavy use. The next step was the Euler equations, which promised to provide more accurate solutions of transonic flows. The methodology used by Jameson in his three-dimensional FLO57 code (1981) was used by others to produce such programs as Lockheed's TEAM program and IAI/Analytical Methods' MGAERO program. MGAERO is unique in being a structured [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] mesh code, while most other such codes use structured body-fitted grids (with the exception of NASA's highly successful CART3D code, Lockheed's SPLITFLOW code and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s NASCART-GT).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ae.gatech.edu/people/sruffin/nascart/|title=NASCART|publisher=Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering|accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> [[Antony Jameson]] also developed the three-dimensional AIRPLANE code (1985) which made use of unstructured tetrahedral grids. In the two-dimensional realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then graduate students at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program (actually a suite of programs) for airfoil design and analysis. This code first became available in 1986 and has been further developed to design, analyze and optimize single or multi-element airfoils, as the MSES program. MSES sees wide use throughout the world. A derivative of MSES, for the design and analysis of airfoils in a cascade, is MISES, developed by Harold "Guppy" Youngren while he was a graduate student at MIT. The Navier–Stokes equations were the ultimate target of developers. Two-dimensional codes, such as NASA Ames' ARC2D code first emerged. A number of three-dimensional codes were developed (ARC3D, [[Overflow (software)|OVERFLOW]], CFL3D are three successful NASA contributions), leading to numerous commercial packages. ==Methodology== In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed. * During [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessing]] ** The [[geometry]] (physical bounds) of the problem is defined. ** The [[volume]]
