The firewall is programmed to distinguish legitimate packets for different types of connections. Only packets matching a known connection state will be allowed by the firewall; others will be rejected. Early attempts at producing firewalls operated at the [[Application Layer|application level]] of the [[OSI model|seven-layer OSI model]] but this required too much CPU speed. [[Packet filter]]s operate at the network layer (layer-3) and function more efficiently because they only look at the [[Header (information technology)|header]] part of a [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]. However, pure packet filters are stateless - they have no memory of previous packets - which makes them vulnerable to [[spoofing attack]]s. ==History== Credit to the inventor of the stateful firewall is usually given to Nir Zuk and his team at [[Check Point]] in the mid-1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[TechWeb]]|title=Who Invented the Firewall?|date=2008-01-15|url=http://www.darkreading.com/security/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208803808}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[Check Point]]|title=Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.

Such a firewall has no way of knowing if any given packet is part of an existing connection, is trying to establish a new connection, or is just a rogue packet. Modern firewalls are connection-aware (or state-aware), offering network administrators finer-grained control of network traffic. The classic example of a network operation that may fail with a stateless firewall is the [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP). By design, such protocols need to be able to open connections to arbitrary high ports to function properly. Since a stateless firewall has no way of knowing that the packet destined to the protected network (to some host's destination port 4970, for example) is part of a legitimate FTP session, it will drop the packet. Stateful firewalls solve this problem by maintaining a table of open connections and intelligently associating new connection requests with existing legitimate connections. ==Description== A stateful firewall is able to hold significant attributes of each connection in memory, from start to finish. These attributes, which are collectively known as the state of the connection, may include such details as the IP addresses and ports involved in the connection and the sequence numbers of the packets traversing the connection. The most CPU intensive checking is performed at the time of setup of the connection. All packets after that (for that session) are processed rapidly because it is simple and fast to determine whether it belongs to an existing, pre-screened session. Once the session has ended, its entry in the state-table is discarded. The stateful firewall depends on the [[Three_way_handshake#Connection_establishment|three-way handshake]] of the TCP protocol when the protocol being used is TCP; when the protocol is UDP, the stateful firewall does not depend on anything related to TCP. When a client initiates a new connection, it sends a packet with the SYN bit set in the [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] [[Header (information technology)|header]]. All packets with the SYN bit set are considered by the firewall as NEW connections. If the service which the client has requested is available on the server, the service will reply to the SYN packet with a packet in which both the SYN and the ACK bit are set. The client will then respond with a packet in which only the ACK bit is set, and the connection will enter the ESTABLISHED state. Such a firewall will pass all outgoing packets through but will only allow incoming packets if they are part of an ESTABLISHED connection, ensuring that [[Black hat|hacker]]s cannot start unsolicited connections with the protected machine. In order to prevent the state table from filling up, sessions will time out if no traffic has passed for a certain period. These stale connections are removed from the state table. Many applications therefore send [[keepalive]] messages periodically in order to stop a firewall from dropping the connection during periods of no user-activity, though some firewalls can be instructed to send these messages for applications. It is worth noting that the most common [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of Service]] attack on the internet these days is the [[SYN flood]], where a malicious user intentionally sends large amounts of SYN packets to the server in order to overflow its state table, thus blocking the server from accepting other connections.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Many stateful firewalls are able to track the state of flows in connectionless protocols, like UDP. Such sessions usually get the ESTABLISHED state immediately after the first packet is seen by the firewall. Sessions in connectionless protocols can only end by time-out. By keeping track of the connection state, stateful firewalls provide added efficiency in terms of packet inspection. This is because for existing connections the firewall need only check the state table, instead of checking the packet against the firewall's rule set, which can be extensive. Also, the concept of [[deep packet inspection]] is unrelated to stateful firewalls,
