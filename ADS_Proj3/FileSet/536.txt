Cartoons]] in 1944.<ref>http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17874931</ref> Bugs starred in 163 shorts in the Golden Age of American animation, and made cameos in three others along with a few appearances in non-animated films. According to ''Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare'', he was born in 1940 in [[Brooklyn, New York]] in a warren under [[Ebbets Field]], home of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. He was actually created by many animators and staff, including [[Tex Avery]], who directed ''[[A Wild Hare]]'', Bugs Bunny's debut, and [[Robert McKimson]], who created the definitive Bugs Bunny character design. According to [[Mel Blanc]], the character's original [[voice actor]], Bugs Bunny has a [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] accent. His [[catchphrase]] is a casual "Eh...what's up, doc?", usually said while chewing a [[carrot]]. Other popular phrases include "Of course you realize, this means war", "Ain't I a stinker?", "What a maroon!" (a twist on "moron"), "What a [[wikt:rube|rube]]!", and "I knew I shoulda taken that left turn at Albuquerque." He is the most prominent of the Looney Tunes characters as his calm, flippant [[wikt:insouciance|insouciance]] endeared him to American audiences during and after World War II. He is a [[mascot]] of the Looney Tunes series, and [[Warner Bros.]] in general. == History== === The unnamed, prototype Warner Bros. rabbit === {{Main|Evolution of Bugs Bunny}} [[File:Bugs Bunny's Evolution.PNG|thumb|left|550px|A depiction of Bugs Bunny through the years.]]An unnamed rabbit with some of the personality of Bugs, though looking very different, first appears in the cartoon short ''[[Porky's Hare Hunt]]'', released on April 30, 1938. Co-directed by [[Ben Hardaway]] and an uncredited [[Cal Dalton]] (who was responsible for the initial design of the rabbit), this short has an almost identical plot to Tex Avery's 1937 cartoon ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'', which had introduced [[Daffy Duck]]. [[Porky Pig]] is again cast as a hunter tracking a silly prey less interested in escape than in driving his pursuer insane. The latter short replaces the little black duck with a small white rabbit. The rabbit introduces himself with the odd expression "Jiggers, fellers", and Mel Blanc gave the rabbit a voice and laugh almost like that he would later use for [[Woody Woodpecker]]. This cartoon also first uses the famous [[Groucho Marx]] line, "Of course you realize, this means war!" This rabbit was so popular with its audience that the Schlesinger staff decided to use it again. The rabbit appears again in 1939's ''[[Prest-O Change-O]]'', directed by [[Chuck Jones]], where he is the pet rabbit of [[unseen character]] Sham-Fu the Magician. Two dogs, fleeing the local dogcatcher, enter his absent master's house. The rabbit harasses them, but is ultimately bested by the bigger of the two dogs. His third appearance is in another 1939 cartoon, ''[[Hare-um Scare-um]]'', directed by Dalton and Hardaway. This short, the first where he is depicted as a gray bunny instead of a white one, is also notable for the rabbit's first singing role. [[Charlie Thorson]], lead animator on the short, gave the character a name. He had written "Bugs' Bunny" on the model sheet that he drew for Hardaway, implying that he considered the rabbit model sheet to be Hardaway's property.<ref name="Barrier"/><ref name="Brittanica">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9095426/Bugs-Bunny |title='&#39;Bugs Bunny'&#39| work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> In promotional material for the short, including a surviving 1939 presskit, the name on the model sheet was altered to become the rabbit's own name: "Bugs" Bunny (quotation marks only used at the very beginning).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/rare-1938-looney-tunes-book-found |title=Leading the Animation Conversation » Rare 1939 Looney Tunes Book found! |publisher=Cartoon Brew |date=2008-04-03 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> In his later years, Mel Blanc stated that a proposed name was "Happy Rabbit".<ref name="Blanc"/> Oddly, "Happy" was only used in reference to Bugs Hardaway. In the cartoon ''[[Hare-um Scare-um]]'', a newspaper headline reads, "Happy Hardaway".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gregbrian.tripod.com/hidden/hid04.html |title=Looney Tunes Hidden Gags |publisher=Gregbrian.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> In Chuck Jones' ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' the rabbit first meets [[Elmer Fudd]]. This rabbit looks more like the present-day Bugs, taller and with a similar face. This rabbit, however, speaks with a rural drawl. The early version of Elmer is also different from the present-day one, much fatter and taller, although [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]'s voice is the same as it would be later. In [[Robert Clampett]]'s 1940 ''[[Patient Porky]]'', a similar rabbit appears to trick the audience into thinking that 750 rabbits have been born. === Bugs Bunny emerges === ''[[A Wild Hare]]'', directed by Tex Avery and released on July 27, 1940, is the first cartoon where both Elmer Fudd and Bugs are shown in their fully developed forms as hunter and tormentor. In this cartoon Mel Blanc first uses what would become the standard voice of Bugs. And Bugs first emerges
