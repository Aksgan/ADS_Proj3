site CriticalSecurity.Net. The Hackbloc Forums also had many HackThisSite users involved then, however they were recently taken down. Before the split, the ''CriticalSecurity.net'' forums had most HTS discussion, specifically related to help with the challenges on the site as well as basic hacking questions. The ''Hackbloc'' forums were more for focused hacktivist discussion as well as a place for people to discuss news and plan future projects. Many people criticize the forums as being too 'newbish' compared to IRC, most likely because many new users visit the forums to ask for help with the challenges. HackThisSite is taking steps to try to attract more qualified users to its forums. ==Articles== HackThisSite members contribute original texts to the articles area of the site. This area is broken down into different sections on a range of topics. Some of these sections include Ethics, HTS Challenge Tutorials, and Political Activism. The topics covered in these articles range widely in complexity. Topics range from [[walkthrough]]s for the missions provided by HackThisSite, to articles regarding advanced techniques in a plethora of programming languages. ==Mission challenges== ''HackThisSite'' is also host to a series of "missions" aimed at simulating real world hacks. These range from ten basic missions where one attempts to exploit relatively simple [[server-side scripting]] errors, to difficult [[Computer programming|programming]] and [[application software|application]] cracking missions. The missions works on a system of points where users are awarded scores based on their completion of missions. In general, the missions become steadily more difficult as the user advances through a particular mission category. ===Basic and realistic challenges=== The Web hacking challenges includes eleven Basic Web Challenges. Each challenge consists of an authentication page with a password entry box, plus other files which are to be exploited or attacked in order to gain the correct password. Successful authentication to the main challenge page will advance the user to the next challenge. These challenges are typically considered simple and are used as an introduction to hacking. There are sixteen Realistic Missions which attempt to mimic real, moderate to difficult hacking, in real life situations. Each mission is a complete web site featuring multiple pages and scripts. Users must successfully exploit one or more of the web sites pages to gain access to required data or to produce changes. ===Programming missions=== A Programming Challenges section also exists. This section currently consists of twelve challenges charging the user to write a program which will perform a specified function within a certain amount of seconds after activation. These programming challenges range from simple missions such as parsing the contents, to reverse-engineering an encryption algorithm. These help users develop and practice on-the-go programming skills. ===Application missions=== The goal of application challenges is generally to extract a key from an application, usually involving some form of reverse-engineering. But other challenges involve program manipulation. ===New missions=== More recently, HTS came out with logic challenges which as moo, HTS's official bot, proclaims "they're not meant as a challenge to overcome like the rest of HTS challenges, they're meant to be overcome by you, and you alone, from solving." In April 2009 the logic challenges were disabled and all points earned from them were removed. One reason cited was concern that the answers could be easily found elsewhere on the internet.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hackthissite.org | url=http://www.hackthissite.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&p=21434 | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> Also of recent creation are the "extended basic" missions. These are designed to be code review missions where you learn how to read code and look for flaws. A set of ten easter eggs hidden around HTS were known as the "HTS missions". One of these "missions" was the fake Admin Panel, for example. Developers later decided to remove HTS easter eggs: some allowed XSS and SQL exploits and many members submitted false bug reports because of them. ===Steganography missions=== [[Steganography]] missions are also available on the website. The goal in these missions is to extract the hidden message from the media file provided. There are 17 steganography missions available.<ref>[http://www.hackthissite.org/missions/playit/stego/0/ HackThisSite Stego Missions]</ref> ==Root This Box== HackThisSite also runs a series of live hacking challenges called RootThisBox where individuals and teams can configure their systems to be used as target [[Server (computing)|boxes]]. Players can then attempt to gain access to these boxes and defend them from other hackers, similar to past 'king of the hill' styled hacking competitions. The project is currently being rebuilt. ==Controversy== There has been criticism that HackThisSite's self-description as a "hacker training ground" encourages people to break the law. Many people related to the site state that although some of the skills taught ''can'' be used for illegal activities, HackThisSite does not participate in or support such activities. Despite this, several individual members have been arrested and convicted for illegal activity (most notably [[Jeremy Hammond]], founder of HackThisSite).<ref>[http://www.hackthissite.org/news/view/354 HackThisSite Founder Sent to do Time]</ref> ===phpBB/HowDark incident=== In November 2004 the (now defunct) HackThisSite-based ''HowDark'' Security Group notified the phpBB Group, makers of the phpBB bulletin software, of a serious vulnerability<ref>{{cite web|title=SQL Injection in phpBT (bug.php) add project|publisher=Security Focus (bugtraq archive)|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/381029|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=phpBB Code EXEC (v2.0.10)|publisher=Security Focus (bugtraq archive)|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/380993|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SQL Injection in phpBT (bug.php)|publisher=Security Focus (bugtraq archive)|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/380984|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> in the product. The vulnerability was kept under wraps while it was brought to the attention of the phpBB admins, who after reviewing, proceeded to downplay its risks.<ref>{{cite web|title=howdark.com "exploits"|publisher=phpBB Group|url=http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=1316231|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> Unhappy with the Groups' failure to take action, ''HowDark'' then published the bug on the [[bugtraq]] mailing-list. Malicious users found and exploited the vulnerability which led to the takedown of several phpBB-based bulletin boards and websites. Only then did the admins take notice<ref>[http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/381510 SecurityFocus Notice]</ref> and release a fix.<ref>[http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=240513 PhpBB Fic]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=howdark.com exploits - follow up|publisher=phpBB Group|url=http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=240513|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=phpBB 2.0.11 released - Critical update|publisher=phpBB Group|url=http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=240636|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> Slowness to patch the vulnerability by end-users led to an implementation of the [http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/6J00O15BPS.html exploit] in the [[Santy|Perl/Santy]] worm (read [http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?date=2004-12-21 full article]) which defaced upwards of 40,000 websites and bulletin boards within a few hours of its release. ===Protest Warrior incident=== On March 17, 2005 [[Jeremy Hammond]], the founder of HackThisSite, was arrested following
