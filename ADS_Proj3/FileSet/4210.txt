high absorbance at the red end of the spectrum, effectively increasing the CCT of the [[gas lamp]] to daylight levels. This is similar in function to a CTO [[color gel]] that photographers and cinematographers use today, albeit much less convenient. Each filter uses a pair of solutions, comprising specific amounts of distilled water, copper sulfate, mannite, pyridine, sulfuric acid, cobalt and ammonium sulfate. The solutions are separated by a sheet of uncolored glass. The amounts of the ingredients are carefully chosen so that their combination yields a color temperature conversion filter; that is, the filtered light is still white. ===Illuminant series D=== {{see also|D65}} [[Image:CIE illuminants D and blackbody small.gif|right|frame|Relative spectral power distribution of illuminant D and a black body of the same correlated color temperature (in red), normalized about 560nm.]] Derived by Judd, MacAdam, and Wyszecki,<ref name=jmw>{{cite journal|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-54-8-1031| title=Spectral Distribution of Typical Daylight as a Function of Correlated Color Temperature|first=Deane B.|last=Judd|coauthors=MacAdam, David L.; Wyszecki, Günter|journal=[[JOSA]]|year=1964|month=August|volume=54|issue=8|pages=1031–1040|doi=10.1364/JOSA.54.001031}}</ref> the '''D''' series of illuminants are constructed to represent natural daylight.
