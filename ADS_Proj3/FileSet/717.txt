already possess the basic technologies necessary for some of the more detailed proposed designs. Noting another proof that self-replicating machines are possible is the simple fact that all living organisms are self replicating by definition. ==History of the concept== The idea of non-biological self-replicating systems was introduced in Samuel Butler's article "Darwin Among the Machines" published only a few years after The Origin of Species. As a serious proposal, it was first suggested by mathematician [[John Von Neumann]] in the late 1940s when he proposed a [[kinematic]] self-reproducing automaton model as a [[thought experiment]]. See Von Neumann, J., 1966, ''The Theory of Self-reproducing Automata'', A. Burks, ed., Univ. of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL. ===Advanced Automation for Space Missions=== In 1980, [[NASA]] conducted a summer study entitled ''[[s:Advanced Automation for Space Missions|Advanced Automation for Space Missions]]'', edited by [[Robert Freitas]], to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop [[Moon|lunar]] resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site. The proposed system would have been capable of [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] productive capacity. The design could be modified to build [[Von Neumann probe]]s to explore the galaxy. The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails. Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic [[robot]]. Power would be provided by a "canopy" of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery could run under the canopy. The study identified four key manufacturing capabilities out of the hundreds commonly used in modern industry: # [[Plaster casting]] for molded parts # [[Laser machining]] for etching and fine tuning # [[Vapor deposition]] for electronics, solar cells, and mirror surfaces # Extrusion of spun [[mineral wool|basalt fiber]] for electrical insulation and fiberglass A "[[casting]] [[robot]]" would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|molds]]. Plaster molds are easy to make, and can make precise parts with good surface finishes. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals. An [[electricity|electric]] or solar [[oven]] would melt the materials. A carbon dioxide laser cutting and welding system was also included. A more speculative, more complex "chip factory" was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins." Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing the ores, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in lunar [[regolith]]. The element that most limited the growth rate was [[chlorine]], needed to process regolith for [[aluminium]]. Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, so the design recycled it. ===Other references=== * [[Freeman Dyson]] expanded upon Neumann's automata theories, and advanced a biotechnology-inspired theory.

Computation could be done by [[fluidic logic]]. Power for the process could be supplied by a pressurized source of the liquid. *In 2001, [[Peter Ward]] mentioned an escaped clanking replicator destroying the human race in his book [[Future Evolution]]. *In 2004, General Dynamics completed a [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/883Toth-Fejel.pdf study] for NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts.

[http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ensab/replicator/] ==Clanking replicators in fiction== In fiction, the idea dates back at least as far as [[Karel &#268;apek]]'s 1921 play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]''. [[A. E. van Vogt]] used the idea as a plot device in his story "M33 in Andromeda" (1943), which was later combined with the three other ''Space Beagle'' stories to became the novel, [[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]. The story describes the creation of self-replicating weapons factories designed to destroy the Anabis, a galaxy-spanning malevolent life form bent on destruction of the human race. An early treatment was the short story ''[[Autofac]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], published in 1955, which precedes von Neumann's original paper about self-reproducing machines. Dick also touched on this theme in his earlier 1953 short story ''[[Second Variety]]''. Another example can be found in the 1962 short story ''[[Epilogue (short story)|Epilogue]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]], in which self-replicating factory barges were proposed that used minerals extracted from ocean water as raw materials. In his short story "Crabs on the Island" (1958) [[Anatoli Dneprov]] speculated on the idea that since the replication process is never 100% accurate, leading to slight differences in the descendants, over several generations of replication the machines would be subjected to [[evolution]] similar to that of living organisms.
