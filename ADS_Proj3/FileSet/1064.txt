In the build numbering system of Mac OS X, every version has a unique beginning build number, which identifies what whole version of Mac OS X it is part of. Mac OS X v10.0 had build numbers starting with 4, 10.1 had build numbers starting with 5, and so forth (earlier build numbers represented developer releases). The point release number in the Darwin version is always the same as the second point number in the Mac OS X version. In the case of Mac OS X v10.1.1 (the version where the jump in version numbers was made), this was build 5M28 and the 10.1.1 release, from which a version number of 5.1 was derived.<ref>Prabhakar, Ernie (November 9, 2001).

It was founded in April 2002 by [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Internet Systems Consortium]]. Its goal was to increase collaboration between Apple developers and the [[free software community]]. Apple benefited from the project because improvements to OpenDarwin would be incorporated into Darwin releases; and the free/open source community supposedly benefited from being given complete control over its own operating system, which could then be used in free software distributions such as [[GNU-Darwin]].<ref>[http://www.opendarwin.info/opendarwin.org/en/ "OpenDarwin."] OpenDarwin Project. Retrieved on 2006-05-30.</ref> On July 25, 2006, the OpenDarwin team announced that the project was shutting down, as they felt OpenDarwin had "become a mere hosting facility for Mac OS X related projects," and that the efforts to create a standalone Darwin operating system had failed. They also state: "Availability of sources, interaction with Apple representatives, difficulty building and tracking sources, and a lack of interest from the community have all contributed to this."<ref>OpenDarwin Core Team and Administrators (July 25, 2006).
