understand, but can our man in the room really be said to understand it? This is essentially what the computational theory of mind presents us with; a model in which the mind simply decodes symbols and outputs more symbols. It is argued that perhaps this is not real learning or thinking at all. However, it can be argued in response to this that it is the man and the paper together that understand Chinese, albeit in a rudimentary way due to the rudimentary nature of the system; as opposed to if the man learned Chinese, which would create a sophisticated system of communicating Chinese. Searle has further raised questions about what exactly constitutes a computation: <blockquote> the wall behind my back is right now implementing the Wordstar program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of Wordstar. But if the wall is implementing Wordstar, if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.<ref name=Searle1992>{{Citation | title = The rediscovery of the mind | year = 1992 | author = Searle, J.R. }}</ref> </blockquote> Putnam has similarly claimed that "every ordinary open system realizes every abstract finite automaton."<ref name=Putnam1988>{{Citation | title = Representation and reality | year = 1988 | author = Putnam, H. }}</ref> Computationalists have responded by aiming to develop criteria describing what exactly counts as an implementation.<ref name=Chalmers1996>{{Citation | title = Does a rock implement every finite-state automaton? | url = http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000226/00/199708001.html | year = 1996 | author = Chalmers, D.J. | journal = Synthese | pages = 309–333 | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | accessdate = 2009-05-27 | doi = 10.1007/BF00413692 }}</ref> <ref> {{Citation|title=On the Nature of Minds, or: Truth and Consequences|journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical AI|date=2008|first=Shimon|last=Edelman|coauthors=|volume=20|issue=|pages=181–196|id= |url=http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/Edelman-JETAI.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-12 }}</ref> Additionally, [[Roger Penrose]] has proposed the idea that the human mind does not use a knowably sound calculation procedure to understand and discover mathematical intricacies.

Consciousness is the computation, there is no extra step or "[[Cartesian Theater]]" in which you become conscious of the computation. * [[Jerry Fodor]] argues that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Further, this language of thought itself is codified in the brain, not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought. * [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] proposed that cognitive processes have three levels of description: the computational level (which describes that computational problem (i.e., input/output mapping) computed by the cognitive process); the algorithmic level (which presents the algorithm used for computing the problem postulated at the computational level); and the implementational level (which describes the physical implementation of the algorithm postulated at the algorithmic level in biological matter, e.g. the brain). (Marr 1981) * [[Ulric Neisser]] coined the term 'cognitive psychology' in his book published in 1967 (Cognitive Psychology), wherein Neisser characterizes people as dynamic information-processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms. * [[Steven Pinker]] described a "language instinct," an evolved, built-in capacity to learn speech (if not writing). * [[Hilary Putnam]] proposed [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)]] to describe consciousness, asserting that it is the computation that equates to consciousness, regardless of whether the computation is operating in a brain, in a computer, or in a "brain in a vat." * [[Bruno Marchal]], professor at the [[Free University of Brussels]], claims in a Ph.D thesis (University of Lille , France, 1998 , Calculabilité , physique et cognition<ref>*[http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/lillethesis/CPC.pdf Bruno Marchal argues that physical supervenience is not compatible with computational theory]</ref>) that physical supervenience is not compatible with computational theory, using arguments like Universal Dovetailer Argument or Movie Graph Argument. ==Alternative Theories== * Classical [[associationism]] * [[Connectionism]] * [[Situated cognition]] * [[Memory-prediction framework]] ==See also== * [[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivism]] * [[Constructivism]] * [[Philosophy of mind]] * [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]] ==Notes== {{reflist}} ==References== * [[Jerry Fodor]] (1975) ''The [[Language of thought]]''. * [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] (1981) ''Vision''. * [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] (1984) [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=5602 ''Computation and Cognition''] * [[Stevan Harnad]] (1994) [http://cogprints.org/1592/ Computation Is Just Interpretable Symbol Manipulation: Cognition Isn't].
