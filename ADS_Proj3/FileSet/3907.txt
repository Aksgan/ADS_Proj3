compete with ATI's HD 3870X2. Though NVIDIA did not release Quad SLI drivers for the 9800 GX2 at time of release, the telltale SLI connector on the top of the card leaves little doubt that users in the future will be able to equip themselves with two 9800GX2s, thus allowing for a total of 4 GPUs in one system via only 2 PCI Express x16 graphics slots, a feat impossible since the 7950GX2. Note that NVIDIA no longer supports Quad SLI on Windows XP (NVIDIA will automatically prevent you from using two 9800GX2s without Windows Vista.) Currently, the only GPU that can support 4-way sli is the GTX 480, and must be used on an Intel [[x58]] chipset combined with a Nvidia nForce 200 chipset, to provide extra PCI lanes. ===3-Way SLI=== {{Update|date=August 2010}} NVIDIA has revealed a triple SLI setup for the [[nForce 700]] series motherboards, which only works on Windows Vista. The setup can be achieved using three high-end video cards with two MIO ports and a specially wired connector (or three flexible connectors used in a specific arrangement).<ref>[http://news.expreview.com/2007-10-11/1192079359d3900.html ExpReview], retrieved October 12, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.vr-zone.com/articles/NVIDIA_Readies_3-Way_SLI_Technology/5341.html VR-Zone report], retrieved October 12, 2007</ref> The technology was officially announced in December 2007, shortly after the revised G92-based [[8800GTS]] made its way out of the factory.

The system consists of a box containing a pair of high-end [[NVIDIA]] [[graphics card]]s featuring a variety of external video connectors. A special [[PCI Express]] card is installed in the host computer, and the two are connected by [[VHDCI]] cables.<ref name=quadroplex>[http://www.NVIDIA.com/quadroplex NVIDIA.com Quadro Plex VCS], retrieved January 28, 2009</ref> The NVIDIA Quadro Plex system supports up to four [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]s per unit. It connects to the host PC via a small form factor [[PCI Express]] card connected to the host, and a 2 meter (6.5 foot) NVIDIA Quadro Plex Interconnect Cable. The system is housed in an external case that is approximately 9.5 inches high, 6 inches wide, and 20.6 inches in depth and weighs about 19 pounds. The system relies heavily on NVIDIA's SLI technology. ===Physics calculation=== In response to [[ATI]] offering a discrete physics calculation solution in a tri-GPU system, NVIDIA announced a partnership with physics [[middleware]] company [[Havok (software)|Havok]] to incorporate a similar system using a similar approach. Although this would eventually become the ''Quantum Effects'' technology, many motherboard companies began producing boards with three PCI-Express x16 slots in anticipation of this implementation being used. In February 2008, NVIDIA acquired physics hardware and software firm Ageia, with plans to increase the market penetration for PhysX beyond its fairly limited use in games; notably Unreal Engine 3. In July 2008, NVIDIA released a beta [[PhysX]] driver supporting GPU acceleration, followed by an official launch on August 12, 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.NVIDIA.com/object/io_1218533603421.html | title=NVIDIA Makes Physics A Reality For Gamers | publisher=[[NVIDIA]] | last=Del Rizzo | first=Bryan | date=2008-08-12 | accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> This allows PhysX acceleration on the primary GPU, a different GPU, or on both GPUs in SLI.

The setup consists of an [[GPU#Integrated graphics solutions|IGP]] as well as a GPU on [[Mobile PCI Express Module|MXM]] module. The IGP would assist the GPU to boost performance when the laptop is plugged to a power socket while the MXM module would be shut down when the laptop was unplugged from power socket to lower overall graphics power consumption.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/06/26/NVIDIAs-hybrid-sli-attacks-amds-powerxpress | title=NVIDIA's Hybrid SLI attacks AMD's PowerXPress | publisher=[[The Inquirer]] | first=Theo | last=Valich | date=2007-06-26 | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/video/display/20070625083756.html | title=NVIDIA Readies Hybrid SLI Technology | publisher=X-bit labs | first=Anton | last=Shilov | date=2007-06-25 | accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref> Hybrid SLI is also available on desktop Motherboards and PCs with PCI-E discrete video cards.

Microsoft added the reason for the decision saying that hybrid graphics systems ‘can be unstable and provide a poor user experience,’ and that it would ‘strongly discourage system manufacturers from shipping such systems.’ Microsoft also added that ‘such systems require a reboot to switch between GPUs.’<ref>[http://www.custompc.co.uk/news/605145/hybrid-sli-and-crossfire-unstable-says-microsoft.html Hybrid SLI and CrossFire unstable, says Microsoft], retrieved November 6, 2008 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> On desktop systems, the motherboard chipsets nForce 720a, 730a, 750a SLI, 780a SLI and 980a SLI and the motherboard GPUs GeForce 8100, 8200, 8300 and 9300 support Hybrid SLI (GeForce Boost and HybridPower).
