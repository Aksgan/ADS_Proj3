"one definite object (such as, 'the present King of England')". If this passage is interpreted as saying that descriptions may "refer" to one definite object, then it could be that Russell actually recognized the two distinct uses of definite descriptions (attributive and referential), which Donnellan later proposed. === Epistemology === In any case, after clarifying the sense of the term "denoting phrase" and providing several examples to illustrate the idea, Russell explains the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] motivations for his theory. Russell believes at this point that there are essentially two modes of knowing: knowledge by description and knowledge by (direct) acquaintance. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to the sense data of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] world and to one's own private inner experiences, while knowledge of everything else (other minds, physical objects, and so on) can only be known by way of general descriptions. ==The theory of descriptions== ===Mathematical description === Russell starts out by defining the "fundamental" notion of a ''[[propositional function]]''. This is basically a modified version of Frege's idea of ''unsaturated concepts''. Hence, "'C(x) stands for a proposition in which x is a constituent and where x, the variable, is essentially and wholly undetermined." The notions of ''everything'', ''nothing'' and ''something'' ("the most primitive of denoting phrases") can then be defined as follows: :<math> C(E) \leftrightarrow \forall x C(x) </math> :<math> C(N) \leftrightarrow \forall x \lnot C(x) </math> :<math> C(S) \leftrightarrow \lnot \forall x \lnot C(x) </math> where ''E'' stands for everything, ''N'' stands for nothing and ''S'' stands for something. ''All'' is taken as primitive and indefinable and the others are defined in terms of it. Russell emphasizes that these notions can have no meaning apart from that which is assigned to them within the propositions in which they occur, all of which are meaningful. This is the foundation of Russell's theory of descriptions as he proceeds to illustrate. ===Illustration === The phrase "the father of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (F) was executed (E)" is interpreted as the following quantificational assertion: :<math> \exists x ((F(x) \land \forall y (F(y) \rightarrow x=y)) \land E(x)) </math> In other words, there is one and only one thing x such that x is the father of Charles II and x was executed. So, if C represents any statement at all about the father of Charles II, the statement 'C (the father of Charles II)' always implies: :<math> \exists x (F(x) \land \forall y (F(y) \rightarrow x=y)) </math> It follows that if there is not one and only one entity that satisfies the above, then every proposition that contains the descriptions is false. (If the mother of Charles II was unfaithful the statement may be false.) In this way, Russell points out, it will turn out that all statements containing non-referring descriptions (e.g. "The present king of [[Samothrace]] is a great writer") are false. Russell's theory reduces all propositions that contain definite descriptions into forms that do not. ==Meinong== He then criticizes [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]'s theory of objects which, according to Russell, is ontologically promiscuous and self-contradictory. Both of these criticisms stem from Meinong's theory that there is an object, whether it exists or subsists, for every set of properties. Therefore there is an object that is both round and not round, or round and square. Russell argues that Meinong's theory entails conclusions such as, "the present King of France" both exists and does not exist. However, Meinong does not attribute existence (or any other sort of being) to ''non-existent objects''. Russell also accuses Meinong of violating the law of non-contradiction by asserting that the "round square" is both round and not round. Meinong, on the other hand, maintains that the laws of logic do not apply to such phenomena as "impossible" objects that have no being.<ref> Grossman, Reinhardt. "Alexius Meinong". ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (ed.) Ted Honderich. 1995 </ref> ==Resolving the problem of negative existentials== One of the fundamental puzzles that Russell hopes to resolve with the theory of descriptions is the problem of non-referring expressions or, as they are now called, negative [[Existential clause|existentials]]. He finally explains how his theory resolves this problem after invoking a distinction between what he calls ''primary'' and ''secondary'' occurrences of denoting phrases. ===Statements about concepts where the object doesnâ€™t exist=== Since definite descriptions are just quantificational devices on Russell's view they can enter into scope relations with other logical operators. In the case of negative existentials, there is an ambiguity between two different (primary and secondary) readings of the quantificational assertion. For example, Russell uses the case of "the present King of France is not bald." Here the two possible readings are: :<math> \exists x ((K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land \lnot B(x)) </math> :<math> \lnot \exists x ((K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land B(x)) </math> In the first case, the statement is false because it quantifies over non-existent entities. In the second case, the statement is true because it is not the case that there is a present King of France. "Thus all propositions in which 'the King of France' has a primary occurrence are false: the denials of such propositions are true, but in them 'the King of France' has a secondary occurrence." Contemporarily, it is customary to discuss Russell's primary/secondary distinction in the more logically exact terms of wide and narrow scope. The scope distinction regards the operator that, on one reading, modifies ''only'' the subject, and on the other, modifies the entire sentence. ===Ambiguity=== Russell resolves the problem of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: "George IV wondered whether Scott is the author of Waverley." In this case, it is obvious that King George is not wondering whether Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the ''de dicto'' / ''de re'' ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence "George IV wondered whether Scott is Sir
