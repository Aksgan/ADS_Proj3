The title piece refers to toes, and we learn that five is not necessarily the optimum number. Gould re-examines the work of astronomer Edmund Halley and 16th-century Irish Archbishop James Ussher, who pinpointed the moment of creation (Oct. 23, 4004 B.C.); Gould finds an "invisible hand" connecting William Paley, Charles Darwin and Adam Smith. His recollection of an incident in his childhood leads to a discussion of selective memory. Other topics are the extinction of land snails on Moorea, development of the tiny bones of the ear, romanticism about the past and Gould's own ecological "Golden Rule" for our planet. He writes about the threatened red squirrel of Arizona and the "evolution" of old tires into sandals. This collection, easily equal to The Panda's Thumb and Bully for Brontosaurus , will not disappoint Gould's fans.''}} ==Reviews== *[http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/home/gould-piggies.html The Snail Wars] - by Derek Bickerton, ''[[The New York Times]]'' *[http://www.senecac.on.ca/quarterly/1993-vol01-num02-winter/reviews/doughty1.html Book review] - by Howard A.

Elapsed real time includes I/O time and all other types of wait. Elapsed Real time is the time measured by an ordinary clock. ==See also== * [[CPU time]] * [[Process (computing)]] * [[Process time]] [[Category:Computing terminology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11812</id> <title>Elastography</title> <text>'''Elastography''' is a non-invasive method in which stiffness or strain [[image]]s of [[soft tissue]] are used to detect or classify [[tumors]]. A tumor or a suspicious [[cancer]]ous growth is normally 5-28 times stiffer than the background of normal soft tissue. When a mechanical compression or vibration is applied, the tumor deforms less than the surrounding tissue. i.e. the strain in the tumor is less than the surrounding tissue. Hence a strain image may, under particular simplifying assumptions, be interpreted as representative of the underlying Young's modulus distribution. == Medical Imaging == [[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] imaging is the most common medical imaging technique for producing elastograms. Some research has been conducted using [[magnetic resonance elastography|magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)]] and [[computed tomography]]. However, using ultrasound has the advantages of being cheaper, faster and more portable than other techniques. ''Transient elastography'' is used for example to measure the stiffness of the liver in vivo (FibroScan, Echosens, France). It is an alternative noninvasive method to [[liver biopsy]]. A correlation between liver elasticity and the fibrosis score (or [[cirrhosis]]) has been shown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ganne-Carrié N, Ziol M, de Ledinghen V, ''et al.'' |title=Accuracy of liver stiffness measurement for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases |journal=Hepatology |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=1511–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17133503 |doi=10.1002/hep.21420}}</ref> Elastography has become an efficient and easy-to-perform component of the breast ultrasound examination because tissue stiffness gauges of various types have been incorporated in a number of high-resolution linear transducers.<ref>Mendelson EB, Chen J, Karstaedt P.

ElcomSoft Sklyarov}} On July 16, 2001, [[Dmitry Sklyarov]], a Russian citizen employed by ElcomSoft who was at the time visiting the United States for [[DEF CON (convention) | DEF CON]], was arrested and jailed for allegedly violating the [[United States]] [[DMCA]] law by writing ElcomSoft's Advanced eBook Processor software. A landmark court case ensued, setting precedents and attracting much public attention and protest. On December 17, 2002, ElcomSoft was found not guilty of all four charges under the DMCA.
