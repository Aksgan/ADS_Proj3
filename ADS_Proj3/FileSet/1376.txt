He left Russia in 1918. He received a Doctorate in mathematics from the [[University of Paris]] in 1923. His mathematical work was mainly on [[infinite series]], on the theory of [[orthogonal polynomials]], on an algorithm for [[singular value decomposition]] which bears his name, on algorithms for the evaluation of elementary functions in computers, and on the enumeration of [[Prime_element#Divisibility.2C_prime_and_irreducible_elements|prime elements]] of the [[Gaussian integers]]. He also invented a [[Three-dimensional chess|three-dimensional version of chess]], and was working at his death with Bobby Fischer on a game of chess for three people. When he first came to America (1941) he taught Mathematics at [[Lehigh University]]. In the early 1950s he was a consultant for IBM in New York City and taught at Columbia University. Prior to moving back to Paris and retiring he was a professor at [[Rockefeller University]]. == Articles and books == * ''Recherches sur la summabilité des séries ultrasphériques par la méthode des moyennes arithmétiques'', J.

There is usually no intention of the language being adopted for real-world programming. Such languages are often popular among [[Hacker (computing)|hackers]] and hobbyists. This use of ''[[wiktionary:esoteric|esoteric]]'' is meant to distinguish these languages from more popular programming languages. Usability is rarely a high priority for such languages; often quite the opposite. The usual aim is to remove or replace conventional language features while still maintaining a language that is [[Turing-complete]], or even one for which the [[Computability theory (computer science)|computational class]] is unknown. ==History== The earliest, and still the [[canonical]] example of an esoteric language was [[INTERCAL]], designed in 1972 by [[Don Woods]] and [[James M. Lyon]], with the stated intention of being unlike any other programming language the authors were familiar with.<ref name="woods-lyon-intercal">{{citation|url=http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal/intercal.txt|last1=Woods|first1=Donald R.|last2=Lyon|first2=James M.|year=1973|title=The INTERCAL Programming Language Reference Manual|accessdate=2009-04-24|publisher=Muppetlabs.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gGhTDeaV|archivedate=2009-04-24}}</ref> It [[parody|parodies]] elements of established programming languages of the day, such as [[Fortran]], [[COBOL]], and [[assembly language]]. Early implementations of INTERCAL were tied to the [[IBM System/360]] and an unidentified Atari computer (probably the [[Atari 2600]]) and have not survived. For many years INTERCAL was represented only by paper copies of the INTERCAL manual. The language's revival in [[1990]] as an implementation in C under [[Unix]] stimulated a wave of interest in the intentional design of esoteric computer languages. In [[1992]], [[Wouter van Oortmerssen]] created [[FALSE]], a small [[stack-oriented programming language]], with syntax designed to make the code inherently obfuscated, confusing, and unreadable. It is also noteworthy for having a compiler of only 1024 bytes. This inspired Urban Müller to create an even smaller language, the now-famous [[brainfuck]], which consists of only eight recognized characters. Along with [[Chris Pressey]]'s [[Befunge]] (like FALSE, but with a two-dimensional instruction pointer), brainfuck is now one of the most well-supported esoteric programming languages. These are canonical examples of minimal [[Turing tarpit]]s and needlessly obfuscated language features; brainfuck's minimality borders on elegant and pure language design; in fact it is related to the [[P′′]] family of [[Turing machine]]s. ==Esoteric programming terms== ===Turing tarpit=== {{Main|Turing tarpit}} A [[Turing tarpit]] is a [[Turing-complete]] programming language whose number of commands, operators, or equivalent objects is very small. These include [[brainfuck]] (8 commands, all with 0 operands), [[OISC]] (1 command, 3 operands), and [[Thue (programming language)|Thue]] (1 command, 2 operands). <!-- But Thue's one "command" isn't really a command at
