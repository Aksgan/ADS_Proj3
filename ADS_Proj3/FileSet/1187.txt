[[Image:Digital Equipment Corporation 1993 logo.png|New 1993 corporate logo|thumb]] In June 1992, [[Ken Olsen]] was replaced by [[Robert Palmer (computer businessman)|Robert Palmer]] as the company's president. Digital's board of directors also granted Palmer the title of chief executive officer ("CEO"), a title that had never been used during Digital's 35-year existence. Palmer had joined DEC in 1985 to run Semiconductor Engineering and Manufacturing. His relentless campaign to be CEO, and success with the Alpha microprocessor family, made him a candidate to succeed Olsen. At the same time a more modern logo was designed<ref>[[Ned Batchelder]] and [http://vt100.net/dec/logo Vt100.net].</ref> During the profitable years up until the early 1990s, DEC was a company that boasted that it never had a general layoff;<ref>Schein, ''et al'', pp. 67, 109.</ref> following the 1992 economic downturn, layoffs became regular events as the company continually downsized to try to stay afloat.<ref>Schein, ''et al'', p. 233.</ref> Palmer was tasked with the goal of bringing DEC back to profitability, which he attempted to do by changing the established DEC business culture, hiring new executives from outside the company, and selling off various non-core business units:<ref>Schein, ''et al'', pp. 128, 144, 234.</ref> * Worldwide training was spun off to form an independent/new company called Global Knowledge Network. * Their database product, [[Oracle Rdb|Rdb]], was sold to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]. * The [[Digital Linear Tape|DLT]] tape technology was sold to [[Quantum Corporation]] in 1994. * [[Text terminal]] business ([[VT100]] and its successors) was sold in August 1995 to [[Boundless Technologies]]. * In March 1997, DEC's [[CORBA]]-based product, ObjectBroker, and its messaging software, MessageQ, was sold to [[BEA Systems|BEA Systems, Inc]]. * In May 1997, DEC sued [[Intel]] for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the [[Original Intel Pentium (P5 microarchitecture)|original Pentium]], [[Pentium Pro]], and [[Pentium II]] chips.<ref>"DEC, Cyrix sue Intel", by Gale Bradley and Jim Detar, ''Electronic News'' '''43''', #2168 (May 19, 1997), ISSN 1061-6624.</ref> As part of a settlement, much of DEC's chip design and fabrication business was sold to Intel. This included DEC's [[StrongARM]] implementation of the [[ARM architecture|ARM computer architecture]], which Intel sold as the [[Intel XScale|XScale]] processors commonly used in [[Pocket PC]]s. The core of Digital Semiconductor, the Alpha microprocessor group, remained with DEC, while the associated office buildings went to Intel as part of the Hudson, Mass. fabrication site. * In 1997, the printer business was sold to [[GENICOM]] (now TallyGenicom), which then produced models bearing the Digital logo. * At about the same time, the networking business was sold to [[Cabletron Systems]], and subsequently spun off as [[Digital Network Products Group]]. * The [[DECtalk]] and [[DECvoice]] voice products were spun off, and eventually arrived at [[Fonix]]. * The rights to the PDP-11 line and several PDP-11 operating systems were sold to Mentec in 1994.<ref>http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060813131029/http://www.mentec-inc.com/</ref> By 1997 Digital had subsidiary companies in more than two dozen countries including Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China (People's Republic), Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Jersey States, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRx.83Pe.7.htm SEC Web site] retrieved January 22, 2008</ref> Eventually, on January 26, 1998, what remained of the company (including Digital's multivendor global services organization and customer support centers) was sold to [[Compaq]], which was acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 2002. The remainder of Digital Semiconductor (the Alpha microprocessor group) was sold to Intel, which placed those employees back in their Hudson, Mass. office which they had vacated when the site was sold to Intel in 1997. Compaq, and later HP, continued to sell many of the former Digital products but rebranded with their own logos. For example, HP now sells what were formerly Digital's StorageWorks disk/tape products,<ref>[http://h18006.www1.hp.com/storage/ HP StorageWorks – Data and Network Storage Products and Solutions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as a result of the Compaq acquisition. The Digital logo survived for a while after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51 percent subsidiary of Compaq). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed "HP GlobalSoft" (also known as the "HP Global Delivery India Center" or HP GDIC) and no longer uses the Digital logo. The digital.com and DEC.com domain names are now owned by Hewlett-Packard and redirect to their US website.<ref>[http://www.digital.com/ Digital.com], [http://www.Dec.com/ DEC.com]</ref> Digital held the [[Classful network|Class A]] [[IP address]] block 16.0.0.0/8. The [[Digital Federal Credit Union]] (DCU), which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC, is now open to essentially everyone, with over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC. ==Research== DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted Digital's corporate research. Some of them were operated by [[Compaq]] and are still operated by [[Hewlett-Packard]]. The laboratories were: * [[Western Research Laboratory]] (WRL) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA * [[DEC Systems Research Center|Systems Research Center]] (SRC) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA * [[Network Systems Laboratory]] (NSL) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA * [[Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (CRL) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], USA * [[Paris Research Laboratory]] (PRL) in [[Paris, France]] * [[MetroWest Technology Campus]] (MTC) in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]], USA Some of the former employees of Digital's Research Labs or Digital's R&D in general include: * [[Gordon Bell]] * [[Henry Burkhardt III]], co-founder of [[Data General|Data General Corporation]] and [[Kendall Square Research]] * [[Michael Burrows|Mike Burrows]] * [[Luca Cardelli]] * [[Dave Cutler]] * [[Edson deCastro|Ed deCastro]], co-founder of [[Data General|Data General Corporation]] * [[Jim Gettys]] * [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]] * [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] * [[Alan Kotok]] * [[Leslie Lamport]] * [[Butler Lampson]] * [[Louis Monier]] * [[Isaac Nassi]] * [[Radia Perlman]] * [[Marcus J. Ranum|Marcus Ranum]] * [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]] * [[Paul Vixie]] Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the ''Digital Technical Journal'',<ref>[http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/dtj/past.htm Digital Technical Journal – Online Issues]</ref> which was in published from 1985 until 1998.<ref>At least some of the research reports are available online at [ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/ ftp.digital.com], in the subdirectories WRL, SRC, NSL, CRL, PRL (see [[Digital Equipment Corporation#Research|Research]] section).
