Using InterMine, you can create databases of biological data accessed by sophisticated web query tools. InterMine can be used to create databases from a single data set or can integrate multiple sources of data. Support is provided for several common biological formats and there is a framework for adding your own data. InterMine includes an attractive, user-friendly web interface that works 'out of the box' and can be easily customised for your specific needs.<ref>http://www.intermine.org</ref> InterMine makes it easy to integrate multiple data sources into a single data warehouse. It has a core data model based on the sequence ontology and supports several biological data formats, just configure which organisms or data files are required. It is easy to extend the data model and integrate your own data, Java and Perl APIs and an XML format to help import custom data. == Supported data formats == * [[Chado]] * [[GFF3]] * [[FASTA]] * [[Gene Ontology|GO]] & gene association files * [[UniProt]] XML * PSI XML (protein interactions, [[Protein Structure Initiative]]) * [[InParanoid]] orthologs * [[Ensembl]] == Web application== A web application allows creation of custom queries, includes template queries (web forms to run 'canned' queries) and can upload and operate on lists of data. It is possible to configure/create widgets to analyse lists with graphs and enrichment statistics. An admin user can publish new template queries, change report pages and create public lists at any time without any programming. Many aspects of the web app can be configured and branded. == Current projects == * [[Generic Model Organism Database]] * [http://www.modencode.org/ modENCODE] * [http://www.flymine.org FlyMine] ==References== {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.intermine.org InterMine] * [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge] * [http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/ Wellcome Trust] [[Category:Databases]] [[Category:Data warehousing products]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18804</id> <title>InterPro</title> <text>{{infobox_biodatabase |title = InterPro |logo =[[File:Database.png]] |description = [[protein families]], [[Protein domain|domains]] and functional sites |scope = |organism = |center = [[EMBL]] |laboratory = [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] |author = |pmid = Hunter & al.

The contents of InterPro are based around diagnostic signatures and the proteins that they significantly match. The signatures consist of models (simple types, such as [[regular expressions]] or more complex ones, such as [[Hidden Markov models]]) which describe protein families, domains or sites. Models are built from the amino acid sequences of known families or domains and they are subsequently used to search unknown sequences (such as those arising from novel genome sequencing) in order to classify them. Each of the member databases of InterPro contribute towards a different niche, from very high-level, structure-based classifications ([[SUPERFAMILY]] and CATH-Gene3D) through to quite specific sub-family classifications ([[PRINTS]] and PANTHER). InterPro's intention is to provide a one-stop-shop for protein classification, where all the signatures produced by the different member databases are placed into entries within the InterPro database. Signatures which represent equivalent domains, sites or families are put into the same entry and entries can also be related to one another. Additional information such as a description, consistent names and [[Gene Ontology]] (GO) terms are associated with each entry, where possible. == Data contained in InterPro == InterPro contains three main entities: proteins, signatures (also referred to as "methods" or "models") and entries. The proteins in [[UniProtKB]] are also the central protein entities in InterPro. Information regarding which signatures significantly match these proteins are calculated as the sequences are released by UniProtKB and these results are made available to the public (see below). The matches of signatures to proteins are what determine how signatures are integrated together into InterPro entries: comparative overlap of matched protein sets and the location of the signatures' matches on the sequences are used as indicators of relatedness. Only signatures deemed to be of sufficient quality are integrated into InterPro. InterPro also includes data for [[Alternative splicing|splice variants]] and the proteins contained in the UniParc and UniMES databases. === InterPro member databases === The signatures from InterPro come from 11 "member databases", which are listed below. ;CATH-Gene3D : describes protein families and domain architectures in complete genomes.
