Lenovo purchased IBM's PC division with $1.75 billion in 2005, making it the world's third-largest PC maker. Both Founder and Lenovo Group maintain strong connections to their academic backers, who are significant shareholders. According to the 2004 Beijing Statistical Yearbook, there are over 12,000 high-tech enterprises throughout Zhongguancun's seven parks, with 489,000 technicians employed. [[Eastdawn Corporation]] is in the [[Sinosteel]] building. Many world renowned technology companies built their Chinese headquarters and research centers in Zhongguancun Technology Park, such as [[Google]], [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Motorola]], [[Sony]], and [[Ericsson]]. [[Microsoft]] is building its Chinese research headquarters in the park that costs $280 million. Once it is completed, it can accommodate 5000 employees. The development center of [[Loongson]], which is China's first general-purpose [[microprocessor]] design, is also in the Zhongguancun area.<ref>[http://www.ict.ac.cn./english/contact/channel/2455.shtml Institute Of Computing Technology Chinese Academy Of Sciences]</ref> ==See also== *[[List of technology centers]] around the world *[[China Beijing Equity Exchange]] *[[China Milan Equity Exchange]] *[[Zhongguancun Administrative Committee]] ==References== {{Reflist}} == External links == {{Commons category|Zhongguancun}} *[http://japanfocus.org/products/details/2661 Article with photos of Zhongguancun's development since the 1980s] *[http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/103601.htm Obituary for Chen Chunxian] *[http://www.zgc.gov.cn/english/pages/approachingpages/9.htm Zhongguancun Management Committee] *[http://www.zgc.gov.cn/english/pages/approachingpages/1.htm Zhongguancun Parks] *[http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/51023.htm Travel Introduction to Zhongguancun] *[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7915125/ Michael Rogers MSNBC Article on Zhongguancun] *[http://www.hilon.com.cn/ Hilon Market Building (in Chinese) ] *[http://www.cctv.com.cn/lm/133/-1/78175.html Map of Zhongguancun ] {{coord|39|58|52|N|116|18|32|E|display=title|region:CN_type:landmark_source:dewiki}} [[Category:Districts of Beijing]] [[Category:High-technology business districts]] [[Category:Zhongguancun]] [[Category:Information technology places]] [[de:Zhongguancun]] [[fr:Zhongguancun]] [[ko:중관춘]] [[hu:Kínai Szilícium-völgy]] [[ja:中関村]] [[no:Zhongguancun]] [[ru:Чжунгуаньцунь]] [[fi:Zhongguancun]] [[zh:中关村]]</text> </page> <page> <id>41091</id> <title>Zip bomb</title> <text>A '''zip bomb''', also known as a '''Zip of Death''' or '''decompression bomb''', is a malicious [[File archiver|archive]] [[computer file|file]] designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. It is often employed to disable [[antivirus software]], so that a more traditional virus sent afterwards could get through undetected. Rather than hijacking the normal operation of the program, a zip bomb allows the program to work as intended, but the archive is carefully crafted so that unpacking it (e.g. by a virus scanner in order to scan for viruses) requires inordinate amounts of time, disk space or memory. A zip bomb is usually a small file (up to a few hundred [[kilobyte]]s) for ease of transport and to avoid suspicion. However, when the file is unpacked its contents are more than the system can handle. The technique has been used on dialup [[bulletin board system]]s at least as long as compressing data archive programs have been around.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Today, most antivirus programs can detect whether a file is a zip bomb and so avoid unpacking it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} One example of a Zip bomb was the file "42.zip" which was 42 [[kilobyte]]s of compressed data, containing five layers of nested zip files in sets of 16, each bottom layer archive containing a 4.3 [[gigabyte]] (4 294 967 295 bytes; ~ 3.99 GiB) file for a total of 4.5 [[petabyte]]s (4 503 599 626 321 920 bytes; ~ 3.99 PiB) of uncompressed data. <ref>[http://www.unforgettable.dk/]</ref> This file is still available for download on various websites across the internet. ==See also== * [[Busy beaver]], a small program that produces maximum output before terminating * [[E-mail_bomb#Zip_bombing]] ==External links== * [http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3027/exploit/ 42.zip on SecurityFocus.com] * [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/07/23/dos_risk_from_zip/ July 2001 story from TheRegister.co.uk] * [http://www.unforgettable.dk/ 42.zip download site] == References == <references /> {{DEFAULTSORT:Zip Bomb}} [[Category:Malware]] [[Category:Denial-of-service attacks]] [[da:Zip-bombe]] [[de:Archivbombe]] [[fr:Bombe de décompression]] [[it:Bomba a decompressione]] [[he:פצצת ZIP]] [[nl:Decompressiebom]] [[ja:高圧縮ファイル爆弾]] [[pl:Bomba dekompresyjna]] [[pt:Bomba Zip]]</text> </page> <page> <id>41117</id> <title>Zombies in popular culture</title> <text><!-- ATTENTION EDITORS: Because of the huge number of zombie references in various media, all non-essential pop culture references and trivia should be placed in the linked list articles rather than here.

Romero]]'s ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'']] '''[[Zombie]]s''' are regularly encountered in [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] themed [[horror fiction|fiction]] and entertainment. They are typically depicted as mindless, shambling, decaying corpses with a [[Cannibalism|hunger for human flesh]], and in some cases, [[human brain]]s in particular. As of 2009, zombies are challenging [[Vampires in popular culture|vampires]] for their popularity.<ref name="USA Today">Craig Wilson, "Zombies lurch into popular culture via books, plays, more," ''[[USA Today]]'', April 9, 2009, p. 1D (1st page of Life section, [[above the fold]]), found at [http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-04-08-zombies-pop-culture_N.htm Zombies lurch into popular culture article at USA Today]. Accessed April 13, 2009.</ref> ==Evolution of the zombie archetype== The flesh-hungry [[undead]], often in the form of [[ghoul]]s and [[vampire]]s, have been a fixture of world mythology dating at least since ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]''<ref>[http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab6.htm] [[The Epic of Gilgamesh]], Tablet VI</ref>, in which the goddess Ishtar promises: ''I will knock down the Gates of the Netherworld'',<br> ''I will smash the door posts, and leave the doors flat down'',<br> ''and will let the dead go up to eat the living!''<br> ''And the dead will outnumber the living!''<ref>[http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab6.htm] [[The Epic of Gilgamesh]], Tablet VI</ref><br> [[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' is another early piece of literature to reference ghouls. A prime example is the story "The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib" (from ''Nights'' vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous ghouls, enslaves them, and converts them to Islam.<ref>{{cite web|title="The Story of Gherib and his Brother Agib"|work=Thousand Nights and One Night|author=Al-Hakawati|accessdate=October 2, 2008|url=http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp}}</ref> ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]], while not a zombie novel proper, prefigures many 20th century ideas about zombies in that the resurrection of the dead is portrayed as a scientific process rather than a mystical one, and that the resurrected dead are degraded and more violent than their living selves. ''Frankenstein'', published in 1818, has its roots in European folklore,<ref>Warner, Marina.
