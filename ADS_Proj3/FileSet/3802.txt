= |sortkey = Ro-Busters }} '''''Ro-Busters''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comics|comic]] story that formed part of the original line-up of ''[[Starlord]]''. Similar in premise to that of the ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' television series, it was created by writer [[Pat Mills]] and was drawn by [[Carlos Pino]] and [[Ian Kennedy (comic artist)|Ian Kennedy]] initially, before Starlord's merger with ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]''. After the merger, [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] were regular artists on the series, along with occasional contributions from [[Mike Dorey]]. Along with ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', Ro-Busters survived Starlord's merger with 2000 AD, its sister comic at IPC Magazines Ltd. The series introduced the de-commissioned war robot [[Hammerstein (robot)|Hammerstein]] and the sewer robot [[Ro-Jaws]], and gave rise to the popular ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series. ==Mandate== ''Robots are going to take over Man's dirtiest jobs . . . clearing his garbage, tending his sick, even fighting his wars!

The concept was based on a suggestion from managing editor [[John Sanders]] and, according to writer [[Pat Mills]] "I did this really as a favour and as a way of pissing off the managing editor who pitched an idea to me about ex-servicemen with super powers who deal with disasters. It was a dreadful idea and I bypassed it by doing Ro-Busters, which he hated - so I knew my story would be a hit"<ref>Bishop (2007) page 40</ref> Although he had stayed with ''2000 AD'', and would go on to be the art editor there, [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] provided the initial designs for ''Ro-Buster''<ref>Bishop (2007) page 41</ref> but would only draw the series later after its move to ''2000 AD''. The stories were drawn by a number of artists and [[Dave Gibbons]] has fond memories of his work on ''Ro-Busters'': {{cquote|"I used to love doing Ro-Busters. I think the "Terra-Meks" story was arguably one of my finest hours. It was a great script Pat wrote for that, really emotional and kind of ''2000 AD'' at its best. Grandiose, outrageous concepts, yet with a real humanity and emotional depth to it as well."<ref>Bishop (2007) page 45</ref>}} Hammerstein, Ro-Jaws and Mek-Quake would go on to be members of the [[ABC Warriors]], first introduced in Hammerstein's flashbacks to his time in the [[Volgan War]]. After the launch of ''ABC Warriors'' Pat Mills never wrote another ''Ro-Busters'' story but there were a number of one-offs published in the ''2000 AD Annual'' during the early eighties, most notable three stories by [[Alan Moore]] which were the last ''Ro-Busters'' tales. ==Overview== ''Ro-Busters'' depicts a world where artificially intelligent robots are so ubiquitous they are treated with contempt by humans and there is a class hierarchy among the robots themselves. Ro-Busters is a commercial rescue organisation run by Howard Quartz, known as "Mr. 10 Per Cent" because 90% of him is robotic (a 'person' must have at least 10% organic matter to qualify as human). Quartz uses robots to carry out his perilous rescue missions because no-one cares if they live or die. Any insubordination in the ranks is dealt with by his enforcer, the psychotic and stupid "kill-dozer" Mek-Quake. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein, the two main characters, are hugely courageous but after each successful mission they are usually greeted with indifference by the authorities. When the owner of Ro-Busters decides to destroy the robots in an 'accident' as a tax evasion measure, Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein lead an escape plot. Once free they learn that a robot underground exists and that a safe haven for free robots has been established on the [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The Ro-Busters by this stage are being pursued by a ruthless police unit charged with suppressing robot liberation. A transport is arranged to take the robots to Titan but at the last moment the police close in so Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein with a few volunteers lead a seeming suicide mission to fight off the authorities and buy time for their comrades to escape. The mission is a success and Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein are seen dancing into the sunset. The series has a high degree of satiric comment on contemporary Britain as [[Pat Mills]] had shown on other series. The brutal police squad sent to capture the robots is a parody of the [[Special Patrol Group]] while the willful destruction of a productive and loyal workforce reflects the effects of [[Thatcherism]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein's names are a word play on the musical writing pairing of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] and the story also features a number of song and dance routines. It is also a ruthless parody of the [[Gerry Anderson]] puppet series [[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. In Thunderbirds, International Rescue carried out its missions for purely altruistic reasons. In Ro-Busters, however, Quartz's team is only sent to help those who have paid for his overpriced 'disaster insurance', and the entire business is operated with a healthy profit margin as its highest priority - actually saving lives is some way down the list. Ro-Busters would turn up in [[Invasion! (2000 AD)|''Savage Book Five'']], set in an alternate 2009; a human Howard Quartz and his Ro-Busters company designed the first [[ABC Warriors]] to liberate Volgan-occupied Britain. Quartz was revealed to be the brother of the US Vice-President [[Dick Cheney|Dick Quartz]] and a leading arms manufacturer; when the US was neutral towards the [[Volgans]], Quartz sold weapons to them via his British subsidiaries. ==Stories== ''[[2000 AD (comic)#Continuity|Timeline]]:'' 2078 â€” 2080 *'''Day of the Robot''' ''Starlord'' Starzine 1 (prologue) Unable to find buyers for his merchandize, robot dealer "Flash" Harry Lowder orders his second-hand robots to report to Mek-Quake for destruction.
