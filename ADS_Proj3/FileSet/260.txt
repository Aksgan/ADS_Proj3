A small, spin-off comic, dubbed ''Applegeeks Lite'', was begun on April 18, 2006,<ref name="aglitefirst">{{cite web|date= April 18, 2006| title= ''Applegeeks Lite'' strip #1|url= http://www.applegeeks.com/lite/index.php?aglitecomic=2006-04-19 | accessdate= May 8, 2006 }}</ref> and updates on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. ''Applegeeks' '' original editor, Emily Adamo, now writes and draws her own webcomic, Fun in Jammies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Applegeeks'' is largely based around the misadventures of "Hawk," a somewhat delusional college student with an unnatural fondness for [[Apple Computer|Apple]] products; his aspiring writer friend, Jayce; and their friends and cohorts. The comic's format shifts between gag-a-day material to spurts of [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], often dealing with material related to technological accomplishments (with unforeseen results), quasi-romantic unease, or situational comedic moments between the characters. It has currently shifted to a far darker tone with the beginning of the Exodus story arc. In its early history, ''Applegeeks'' was often compared to another popular webcomic, ''[[Mac Hall]]'', written by [[Matt Boyd]] and illustrated by [[Ian McConville]].<ref name="machall">{{cite web|date= December 16, 2004| title= Panagariya comments on ''Applegeeks'' being compared to ''Mac Hall''|url= http://www.hawkstudios.net/blog_archives/2004/12/whatever.html |accessdate= June 21, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060513210158/http://www.hawkstudios.net/blog_archives/2004/12/whatever.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 13, 2006}}</ref> However, both comics have since taken different directions in both art and humor. Artistically, McConville has moved into a painted, cel-shaded style, while Haque has gone with a more traditional inked look and [[anime]] inspired coloring. In writing, Boyd continues to represent college dorm humour with the occasional [[video game]] reference, while Panagariya has produced humor based on technological blunders and lasting character relationships. Applegeeks has finished its first book called "{{cite web | title=Applegeeks Volume 1: Freshman Year | url=http://www.tfaw.com/Profile/___15-630?dhrf=d3d3LmFwcGxlZ2Vla3MuY29tLyZkZWJ1Zz0w | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=}}," and includes the strips first two years of material. It is currently up for pre-order and is scheduled for release in early May 2009 . In late 2005, ''Applegeeks'' fan Chris Davis used the [[Lulu.com]] publishing service to publish his own [[trade paper back]] of ''Applegeeks'' comics.<ref name="plagiarism">{{cite web|last= Bailey|first= Jonathon|date= November 14, 2005| title= When Fans Infringe Copyright|url= http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/?p=123 | accessdate= April 23, 2006 }}</ref> Haque and Panagariya expressed discontent,<ref name="plagiarism3">{{cite web|last= Panagariya|first= Ananth|date= November 13, 2005| title= Panagariya comments on the LuLu.com publishing controversy |url= http://www.applegeeks.com/blog_archive/view.php?id=1236 | accessdate= June 21, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060506083029/http://www.applegeeks.com/blog_archive/view.php?id=1236 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 6, 2006}}</ref> although they did not threaten legal action.<ref name="plagiarism"/> Reportedly, the matter was later resolved, with Davis apologizing for his actions and admitting them to be in "bad form."<ref name="plagiarism"/> ==Plot and recurrent themes== ''Applegeeks''' overall narrative primarily consists of the story of Hawk's creation, Eve. She is constructed from the remains of an Apple [[robot]], which was originally intended by Hawk to make toast, although he gave up this plan after realizing that the robot would merely consume the toast itself. After its subsequent destruction at the hands of [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)#Ethan|Ethan]]'s X-Bot (both main characters from ''[[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|Ctrl+Alt+Del]]'', a popular webcomic), its parts are used to create Eve - a feminine [[android (robot)|android]], or [[gynoid]]. Soon after her introduction and minor development as a character, Eve's personality collapses and she destroys an Apple store. A battle ensues between Hawk and Eve in an attempt to subdue and capture her. While Hawk distracts Eve, Gina plugs her into Hawk's laptop and uploads a virus that shuts her down. Afterward, the inoperative body of Eve is stolen by Frost, due to his jealousy of Hawk's inventive talents. Hawk, Jayce and Gina travel to Japan to rescue Eve and in a climactic confrontation the warehouse where she was held is destroyed in a massive explosion. This begins the Exodus story arc. Though having an overall narrative of a sort, ''Applegeeks'' additionally has several running subplots that appear frequently throughout the comic. For example, the romance of Jayce Wilder and Alice Fox subplot appears frequently â€” the two were childhood friends and despite early troubles expressing their feelings, both are currently engaged in dating; Captain Power (of no relation to the [[Captain Power|late 1980's show of the same name]], nor to the toy line), the imagined superhero alter ego of Hawk, who somewhat resembles Stupendous Man from ''[[Calvin & Hobbes]]'', and wears a [[Power symbol]] bandana down over his eyes (or more recently, a ''[[Naruto]]''-style headband with the Apple "power" logo displayed); and Hawk's troubles during [[Ramadan]], usually including hallucinations brought on by hunger, and Jayce tormenting him by eating large amounts of food in front of him. There is also a girl named Ashley who starts a vendetta on Hawk with the assistance of her partner Mistah Bear because he destroyed her tricycle. ''Applegeeks'' also makes use of several [[running gags]]: the [[Calling shotgun|Shotgun Game]], in which a person calls out "shotgun," but may be challenged for their position in the front seat by another individual, who does so by dropping their pants (but not undergarments), and in turn must respond by dropping ''their'' pants and racing the challenger to the vehicle (this has often made the driver pull away at an extremely hurried pace, even if he or she knows the people with the pants down); the plastic bubble that Hawk is placed in whenever he enters an Apple store, in order to avoid "[http://www.applegeeks.com/comics/viewcomic.php?issue=166 mishaps]"; and numerous references to other webcomics, often including cameo appearances by objects and characters from such webcomics as ''[[Megatokyo]]'' and ''Ctrl+Alt+Del''. For example, the ''Megatokyo'' character Ping appeared in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comics/viewcomic.php?issue=273 strip 273] of ''Applegeeks''. Another example is when they try to rescue Eve and become surrounded by enemies, at which point they call Junpei and a Rent-a-Zilla to aid them. ==Characters== <!-- Commented out: [[Image:Geek inside all of us.jpg|right|thumb|140px|From right to left, Hawk, Jayce, Alice, Gina, and off to the side, Mr. Squirrely]] --> *'''Hawk''' is ''Applegeeks<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' main protagonist.
