These equations arise from applying [[Newton's second law]] to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], together with the assumption that the fluid [[stress (physics)|stress]] is the sum of a [[diffusion|diffusing]] [[viscosity|viscous]] term (proportional to the gradient of velocity), plus a [[pressure]] term. The equations are useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest. They may be used to [[model (abstract)|model]] the [[weather]], [[ocean current]]s, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a [[airfoil|wing]]. The Navier–Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with [[Maxwell's equations]] they can be used to model and study [[magnetohydrodynamics]]. The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist ([[Existence theorem|existence]]), or that if they do exist, then they do not contain any [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] (smoothness). These are called the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]] problems. The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has called this one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|seven most important open problems in mathematics]] and has offered a US$1,000,000 prize for a solution or a counter-example.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.claymath.org/millennium/ | title = Millennium Prize Problems | publisher = Clay Mathematics Institute | accessdate = 2009-04-11 }}</ref> The Navier–Stokes equations dictate not [[position (vector)|position]] but rather [[velocity]]. A solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field, which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time. Once the velocity field is solved for, other quantities of interest (such as flow rate or drag force) may be found. This is different from what one normally sees in [[classical mechanics]], where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a [[wiktionary:Particle|particle]] or deflection of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|trajectories]]. ==Properties== ===Nonlinearity=== The Navier–Stokes equations are [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equations]] in almost every real situation. In some cases, such as one-dimensional flow and [[Stokes flow]] (or creeping flow), the equations can be simplified to linear equations. The nonlinearity makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve and is the main contributor to the [[turbulence]] that the equations model. The nonlinearity is due to [[convective]] acceleration, which is an acceleration associated with the change in velocity over position. Hence, any convective flow, whether turbulent or not, will involve nonlinearity. An example of convective but [[laminar]] (nonturbulent) flow would be the passage of a viscous fluid (for example, oil) through a small converging [[nozzle]]. Such flows, whether exactly solvable or not, can often be thoroughly studied and understood. ===Turbulence=== [[Turbulence]] is the time dependent [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior seen in many fluid flows. It is generally believed that it is due to the [[inertia]] of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of time dependent and convective acceleration; hence flows where inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the [[Reynolds number]] quantifies how much the flow is affected by inertia). It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe turbulence properly. The numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales that are involved in turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation (see [[Direct numerical simulation]]). Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations]] (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models (such as the k-ε model), are used in practical [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Another technique for solving numerically the Navier–Stokes equation is the [[Large eddy simulation]] (LES). This approach is computationally more expensive than the RANS method (in time and computer memory), but produces better results since the larger turbulent scales are explicitly resolved. ===Applicability=== Together with supplemental equations (for example, conservation of mass) and well formulated boundary conditions, the
