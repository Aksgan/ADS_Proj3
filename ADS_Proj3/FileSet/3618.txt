as a reaction to the straightforwardly empiricist views of [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]]. Hume had given persuasive logical arguments that people cannot infer causality from perceptual input. The most one could hope to infer is that two events happen in succession or simultaneously. One response to this argument involves positing that concepts that are not supplied by experience, such as causality, must exist prior to any experience and hence must be innate. The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804) argued in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that the human [[mind]] knows objects in innate, [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] ways. Kant claimed that humans, from birth, must experience all objects as being successive ([[time]]) and juxtaposed ([[space]]). His list of inborn [[Category (Kant)|categories]] describes [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] that the mind can attribute to any object in general. [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] (1788-1860) agreed with Kant, but reduced the number of innate categories to one, namely, [[causality]], which presupposes the others. ==Modularity== Nativism is most associated with the work of [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Steven Pinker]], who argue that we are born with certain [[cognitivism|cognitive]] [[modularity|modules]] (specialised genetically inherited psychological abilities) that allow us to learn and acquire certain skills (such as [[language]]). For example, children demonstrate a facility for acquiring spoken language but require intense training to learn to read and write. In ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', Pinker cites this as evidence that humans have an inborn facility for [[Language acquisition|speech acquisition]] (but not for [[literacy]] acquisition). A number of other theorists have disagreed with these claims. Instead, they have outlined alternative theories of how modularization might emerge over the course of development, as a result of a system gradually refining and fine-tuning its responses to environmental stimuli. <ref>{{cite book|last=Karmiloff-Smith|first=Annette|title= Beyond Modularity: A Developmental Perspective on Cognitive Science|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1996|isbn= 0262611147}}</ref> ==Criticism== Nativism is sometimes perceived as being too vague to be falsifiable, as there is no fixed definition of when an ability is supposed to be judged "innate." (As [[Jeffrey Elman]] and colleagues pointed out in [[Rethinking Innateness]], it is unclear exactly ''how'' the supposedly innate information might actually be coded for in the genes)<ref name="Elman">Elman, J.L., Bates, E.A., Karmiloff-Smith, A., Johnson, M.H., Parisi, D. & Plunkett, K.

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</ref> Further, modern nativist theory makes little in the way of specific testable (and falsifiable) predictions, and has been compared by some empiricists to a pseudoscience or nefarious brand of "psychological creationism." As influential psychologist [[Henry L. Roediger III]] remarked, "Chomsky was and is a rationalist; he had no uses for experimental analyses or data of any sort that pertained to language, and even experimental psycholinguistics was and is of little interest to him."<ref name="Roediger">Roediger, R. (2004) "[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=1540 What happened to Behaviorism]." American Psychological Society.</ref> Some researchers argue that the premises of linguistic nativism were motivated by outdated considerations and need reconsidering. For example, nativism was at least partially motivated by the perception that statistical inferences made from experience were insufficient to account for the complex languages humans develop. In part, this was a reaction to the failure of [[behaviorism]] and behaviorist models of the era to easily account for how something as complex and sophisticated as a full-blown language could ever be learned. Indeed, several nativist arguments were inspired by Chomsky's assertion that children could not learn complicated grammar based on the linguistic input they typically receive, and must therefore have an innate language-learning module, or [[language acquisition device]]. However, it is now known that many of the claims in Chomsky's famous [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument are empirically false and that children can employ generalization and statistical learning to learn a wide array of both word forms and word distributions [citation needed]. Over the last several decades, with the advent of more complex and sophisticated brands of mathematics such as [[complexity theory]] and [[game theory]], it has become increasingly apparent that extremely complicated systems can evolve from agents with few (if any) pre-programmed rules. Many empiricists are now also trying to apply modern [[learning models]] and techniques to the question of language acquisition, with marked success.<ref name="Ramscar">Ramscar, M. & Yarlett, D.

Sellars describes psychological nominalism as the view that "“all awareness of sorts, resemblances, facts, etc., in short, all awareness…is a linguistic affair.” Judging solely from the mention in EPM, Psychological Nominalism would seem to be a form of Verbal Behaviorism, which holds that ascriptions of psychological states are definitionally equivalent to predictions about behavior. For example, the [[verbal behavior|Verbal Behaviorist]] holds that a statement like "John is scared of thunderstorms" is meaningful only insofar as it can be parsed into predictions concerning the sorts of things John is likely to say and/or do in the event of a thunderstom (i.e. "John will say, or have a propensity to say, "I am scared" when he hears thunder" or "John will hide, or have a propensity to hide, his face when he sees lightning").
