Ordinarily, these are formally-defined operative units to incorporate into larger [[Module (programming)|programming module]]s. Snippets are often used to clarify the meaning of an otherwise "cluttered" function, or to minimize the use of repeated code that is common to other functions. '''Snippet management''' is a feature of some [[text editor]]s, program [[source code editor]]s, [[integrated development environment|IDE]]s, and related [[software]]. It allows the user to [[Persistence (computer science)|persist]] and use snippets in the course of routine edit operations.<ref name="gedit_feature">{{cite web | title = GEdit feature example | url = http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Plugins/Snippets | accessdate = 2010-01-09<!-- 04:56:40 -->}} example of the feature in the gedit editor.</ref> ==Overview== Snippet management is a text editor feature popular among software developers or others who routinely require content from a catalogue of repeatedly entered text (such as with [[source code]] or [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]]). Often this feature is justified because the content varies only slightly (or not at all) each time it is entered. ===Snippets in text editors=== Text editors that include this feature ordinarily provide a mechanism to manage the catalogue, and separate "snippets" in the same manner that the text editor and operating system allow management of separate files. These [[Create, read, update and delete|basic management abilities]] include operations such as viewing, adding, editing, deleting, sorting, filtering, grouping, renaming and storing snippets in a [[Software repository|repository]], catalogue or [[database]]. ===Snippets in IDEs=== Some programmer's applications such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[NetBeans]] and Microsoft's [[Visual Studio]] (a keyword and {{keypress|Tab}}) and other [[Integrated Development Environment|IDEs]] include built-in parts of structure for ease of coding. Other applications such as Macromedia [[Dreamweaver]] make use of these code snippets as well for [[Web development]]. ===Snippets in JIT compilers=== Just-in-time ([[JIT]]) compilers can "splice together" pre-compiled sections of code as longer [[object code]]/[[machine code]] segments. This reduces interpret time significantly and simultaneously speeds execution. ==Conventions== In addition to the basic management abilities described previously, snippet management features can be classified according to the scope of interactivity between snippets and the text editor or application that hosts them. These snippet feature groups include: * plain-text or "static" snippets * interactive or "dynamic" snippets * scriptable snippets '''Static''' snippets consist primarily of fixed text that the user can choose to insert into the current document. The user is not able to specify anything else, except perhaps the cursor position relative to the newly inserted text. Static snippets are similar to simple [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. '''Dynamic''' snippets consist of fixed text combined with dynamic elements. The user may specify both the content of the dynamic elements, as well as their position relative to the fixed text, as part of choosing what to insert into the current document. Examples of dynamic elements could be variables such as the current date or system time, or input from the user that is supplied via a GUI, or input from another application. (see also: [[Macro (computer science)#Programming macros|programmable macro]]). '''Scriptable''' snippets consist of runnable segments of code in either a macro language or a [[scripting language]]. Scriptable snippets provide the greatest degree of flexibility to the user, although that depends somewhat on the programming languages supported by the text editor, and whether or not the programming language is well-known, or particular and unique to that specific editor. The type of scripting support varies, but may include features such as running [[Unix shell|shell command]]s, providing a [[dialog box|GUI dialog]] or other methods of user interaction with the operating system; other applications; or other sub-components of the hosting application itself. <!-- (This probably belongs somewhere else) *At search engine result pages, snippet is an extract of webpage content with a user's query highlighted <b>bold</b>.

The values for placeholders are not determined until the text of the snippet is inserted during an editing session. Placeholders may have special [[Markup language|markup syntax]] that allows the editor to identify the boundaries of [[Template (software engineering)|placeholders]] relative to the other text in the current edit buffer. Other applications employ [[graphical user interface]]s and [[Modal window|modal dialog box]]es that allow the user to enter one or more values to
