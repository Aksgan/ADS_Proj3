It is a [[system call]] that allows two [[Process (computing)|processes]] to exchange a single data item while synchronizing. The rendezvous call takes a ''tag'' and a ''value'' as its arguments. The tag is typically an address in memory shared by both processes. Calling rendezvous causes a process to sleep until a second rendezvous call with a matching tag occurs. Then, the values are exchanged and both processes are awakened. More complex synchronization mechanisms can be created from this primitive operation.

Simulations created in Renque are widely used to analyze and improve operating procedures of logical systems. ==Product description== A simulation model is constructed on-screen by placing server objects on a worksheet and interconnecting the servers by links. During a simulation, entities are created, which migrate through the network of servers and links, by traveling from server to server on the links. The simulation imitates the progress of a real process in a figurative manner, essentially by the spread of entities across the model. In order to attain close agreement with the operation mechanism being modeled, the capabilities of a simulation model can be expanded by such things as random number generators, scheduled operations, data management utilities and simulation control by scripting. Simulations results can be visualized in animations, presented in data tables and exported to other applications. ==See also== * [[Computer simulation]] * [[Process optimization]] * [[Business process modeling]] * [[Logistics]] '''Related software products''' * [[AnyLogic]] * [[Arena (software)|Arena]] * [[GoldSim]] * [[Simul8|SIMUL8]] ==References== * [http://www.renque.com/downloads/RenqueManual.pdf User manual] ==External links== * [http://www.renque.com/ Renque website] [[Category:Application software]] [[Category:Events (computing)]] [[Category:Simulation software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31832</id> <title>Repeated game</title> <text>In [[game theory]], a '''repeated game''' ('''supergame''' or '''iterated game''') is an [[extensive form game]] which consists in some number of repetitions of some base game (called a '''stage game'''). The stage game is usually one of the well-studied [[list of games in game theory|2-person games]]. It captures the idea that a player will have to take into account the impact of his current action on the future actions of other players; this is sometimes called his reputation. The presence of different [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] properties is because the threat of retaliation is real, since one will play the game again with the same person. It can be proved that every strategy that has a payoff greater than the minmax payoff can be a Nash Equilibrium, which is very large set of strategies. ''Single stage game'' or ''single shot game'' are names for non-repeated games. ==Finitely vs infinitely repeated games== Repeated games may be broadly divided into two classes, depending on whether the horizon is finite or infinite. The results in these two cases is very different. Even finitely repeated games are not necessarily finite horizon, the player may just perceive a probability of another cycle and act accordingly. For example, the fact the everyone has a fixed lifetime doesn't mean that all games should be finite horizon. Also, players might act differently when the horizon is far away as opposed to when it is close by, which can probably be thought of as a time modifier function applied to the payoff. The difference in strategies for finite versus infinite horizon games is a hotly debated topic, and many game theorists have differing views regarding it. ==Infinitely repeated games== The most widely studied repeated games are games that are repeated a possibly infinite number of times. On many occasions, it is found that the optimal method of playing a repeated game is not to repeatedly play a Nash strategy of the constituent game (look at the Repeated prisoner's dilemma example), but to cooperate and play a socially optimum strategy. This can be interpreted as a "social norm" and one essential part of infinitely repeated games is punishing players who deviate from this cooperative strategy. The punishment may be something like playing a strategy which leads to reduced payoff to both players for the rest of the game (called a trigger strategy). There are many results in theorems which deal with how to achieve and maintain a socially optimal equilibrium in repeated games. These results are collectively called [[Folk theorem (game theory)|''"Folk Theorems"'']]. An important feature of a repeated game is the way in which a player's preferences may be modeled. There are many different ways in which a preference relation may be modeled in an infinitely repeated game, the main ones are : *Discounting - valuation of the game diminishes with time depending on the discount parameter <math>\delta</math> *Limit of means - can be thought of as an average over T periods as T approaches infinity. <math>\lim_{T\to\infty}\sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{T}(v_i^t) > 0</math> *Overtaking - Sequence <math>v_i^t</math> is superior to sequence <math>w_i^t</math> if <math>\lim_{T\to\infty} \sum_{t=1}^T (v_i^t-w_i^t) > 0</math> [[Robert Aumann]]'s [[Blackmailer Paradox]] appears to be a repeated game in which the [[ultimatum game]] is played many times by the same players for high stakes. ==Finitely repeated games== As explained earlier, finite games can be divided into two broad classes. In the first class of finitely repeated games where the time period is fixed and known, it is optimal to play the Nash strategy in the last period. When the Nash
