then re-transmitted word-for-word on the ''Abwehr's'' internal Enigma networks, which gave the best possible [[Known-plaintext attack|crib]] for deciphering that day's indicator setting. Interception and analysis of ''Abwehr'' transmissions led to the remarkable state of affairs that allowed [[MI5]] to give a categorical assurance that all the German spies in Britain were controlled as [[double agents]] working for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] under the [[Double Cross System]].<ref name="Michael Smith 2007 p. 129"/> ===German Army Enigma=== In the summer of 1940 following the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|Franco-German armistice]], most Army Enigma traffic was travelling by land lines rather than radio and so was not available to Bletchley Park. The air [[Battle of Britain]] was crucial, so it was not surprising that the concentration of scarce resources was on ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Abwehr'' traffic. It was not until early in 1941 that the first breaks were made into German Army Enigma traffic, and it was the spring of 1942 before it was broken reliably, albeit often with some delay.<ref>Colvocoressi (2001) p. 99</ref> It is unclear whether the German Army Enigma operators made deciphering more difficult by making fewer [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|operating mistakes]].<ref> Sullivan and Frode (2005) p. 215 </ref> ===German naval Enigma=== The German Navy used Enigma in the same way as the German Army and Air Force until 1 May 1937 when they changed to a substantially different system. This used the same sort of setting sheet but, importantly, it included the ground key for a period of two, sometimes three days. The message setting was concealed in the indicator by selecting a trigram from a book (the ''Kenngruppenbuch'', or K-Book) and performing a bigram substitution on it.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Supreme Command of the Navy | title = The Enigma General Procedure (Der Schluessel M Verfahren M Allgemein) | work = The Bletchley Park translated Enigma Instruction Manual, transcribed and formatted by [[Anthony Sale|Tony Sale]] | place = Berlin | publisher = Supreme Command of the German Navy | year = 1940 | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/egenproc.pdf | accessdate = 26 November 2009 }}</ref> This defeated the Poles, although they suspected some sort of bigram substitution. The procedure for the naval sending operator was as follows. First they selected a trigram from the K-Book, say YLA. They then looked in the appropriate columns of the K-Book and selected another trigram, say YVT, and wrote it in the boxes at the top of the message form: {| class="wikitable" | border="1" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |- | align="center" | . ||align="center" | Y ||align="center" | V || align="center" | T |- | align="center" | Y || align="center" | L || align="center" | A || align="center" | . |} They then filled in the "dots" with any letters, giving say: {| class="wikitable" | border="1" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |- | align="center" | Q ||align="center" | Y ||align="center" | V || align="center" | T |- | align="center" | Y || align="center" | L || align="center" | A || align="center" | G |} Finally they looked up the vertical pairs of letters in the Bigram Tables {{center|QY→UB YL→LK VA→RS TG→PW}} and wrote down the resultant pairs, UB, LK, RS and PW which were transmitted as two four letter groups at the start and end of the enciphered message. The receiving operator performed the converse procedure to obtain the message key for setting his Enigma rotors. As well as these ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures being much more secure than those of the German Army and Air Force, the German Navy Enigma introduced three more rotors (VI, VII and VIII), early in 1940.<ref>Copeland (2004) p. 225</ref> The choice of three rotors from eight meant that there were a total of 336 possible permutations of rotors and their positions. [[Alan Turing]] decided to take responsibility for German naval Enigma because "no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself".<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1945) Ch. II Para. 11</ref> He established [[Hut 8]] with [[Peter Twinn]] and two "girls".<ref>Copeland (2004) p. 258</ref> Turing used the indicators and message settings for traffic from 1–8 May 1937 that the Poles had worked out, and some very elegant deductions to diagnose the complete indicator system. After the messages were deciphered they were translated for transmission to the Admiralty in Hut 4. ====German Navy 3-rotor Enigma==== The first break of wartime traffic was in December 1939, into signals that had been intercepted in November 1938, when only three rotors and six plugboard leads had been in use.<ref name = MahonP22>Mahon (1945) p. 22</ref> It used "Forty Weepy Weepy" cribs. A captured German ''Funkmaat''<ref>German for radio operator</ref> Meyer had revealed that numerals were now spelt out as words. EINS, the German for "one", was present in about 90% of genuine German Navy messages. An EINS catalogue was compiled consisting of the encipherment of EINS at all 105,456 rotor settings.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1946) Ch. II Para. 21</ref> These were compared with the ciphertext, and when matches were found, about a quarter of them yielded the correct plaintext. Later this process was automated in Mr Freeborn's section using [[Unit record equipment|Hollerith equipment]]. When the ground key was known, this EINS-ing procedure could yield three bigrams for the tables that were then gradually assembled.<ref name = MahonP22 /> Further progress required more information from German Enigma users. This was achieved through a succession of ''pinches'', the capture of Enigma parts and codebooks. The first of these was on 12 February 1940, when rotors VI and VII, whose wiring was at that time unknown, were captured from the ''[[German submarine U-33 (1936)|U-33]]'', by HMS Gleaner. On 26 April 1940 the Narvik-bound German patrol boat VP2623, disguised as a Dutch trawler named ''Polares'', was captured by HMS Griffin. This yielded an instruction manual, codebook sheets and a record of some transmissions, which provided complete ''cribs''. This confirmed that Turing's deductions about the trigram/bigram process was correct and allowed a total of six days' messages to be broken, the last of these using the
