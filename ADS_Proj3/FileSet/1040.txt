Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A dye flip is a type of replicate done to remove any dye effects in two-channel dyes, in one slide one same is labeled with Cy3 the other with Cy5, this is reversed in a different slide. In this example, in the presence of [[aminoallyl]]-UTP added in the RT mix. # The labeled samples are then mixed with a propriety [[nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] solution which may contain [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]], [[citrate|SSC]], [[dextran|dextran sulfate]], a blocking agent (such as COT1 DNA, salmon sperm DNA, calf thymus DNA, [[PolyA]] or PolyT), [[Denhardt's solution]] and [[Methylamine|formamine]]. # This mix is denatured and added to a pin hole in a microarray, which can be a [[gene chip]] (holes in the back) or a glass microarray which is bound by a cover, called a mixer, containing two pinholes and sealed with the slide at the perimeter. # The holes are sealed and the microarray hybridized, either in a hyb oven, where the microarray is mixed by rotation, or in a mixer, where the microarray is mixed by alternating pressure at the pinholes. # After an overnight hybridization, all nonspecific binding is washed off (SDS and SSC). # The microarray is dried and scanned in a special machine where a laser excites the dye and a detector measures its emission. # The image is gridded with a template and the intensities of the features (several pixels make a feature) are quantified. # The raw data is normalized, the simplest way is to subtract the background intensity and then divide the intensities making either the total intensity of the features on each channel equal or the intensities of a reference gene and then the [[t-value]] for all the intensities is calculated. More sophisticated methods include [[z-score|z-ratio]], [[local regression|loess and lowess regression]] and RMA (robust multichip analysis) for Affymetrix chips (single-channel, silicon chip, in situ synthesised short oligonucleotides). ==See also== *[[DNA microarray]] *[[Microfluidics]] or [[lab-on-chip]] *[[Quantification of nucleic acids]] *[[Cyanine]] dyes, such as Cy3 and Cy5 *[[Protocol (natural sciences)]] *[[Replication|sample replication]] *[[Molecular biology]] *[[Serial analysis of gene expression]] == External links == * [http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/labs/microarray/ DNA microarray virtual experiment] {{Molecular Biology}} ==References== * Gibson and Muse, A primer of genome science etc ISBN 0-87893-232-1 * Chomczynski, P. & Sacchi, N.

It was based upon [[X.25]], which was particularly popular in European telecommunications circles at that time. In that incarnation it was rated at 1 Mbit/s over [[RS-422]]. In the 80's, [[ISC Systems Corporation]] (ISC) purchased DNET as part of their purchase of [[DNIX]], and ported it to run over [[Ethernet]]. ISC's choice of DNET over [[TCP/IP]] was in part due to the relative light weight of the DNET [[protocol stack]], allowing it to run more efficiently on the target machinery. DNET was also [[auto-configuration|auto-configuring]] so there was no manual configuration of the local network, all that was required was that each machine in a network be given a unique name. This simplicity was advantageous in ISC's market. Being based on [[X.25]], DNET was [[telecommunication circuit|connection]]-oriented, [[datagram]]-based (as opposed to a [[byte stream]]), supported [[out-of-band]] (interrupt) messages, and provided [[data link|link]]-down notifications to its [[client (computing)|clients]] and [[server (computing)|servers]] so that applications did not have to provide their own [[heartbeat]]s. In the financial community these were all considered advantages over, say, [[TCP/IP]]. DNET also supported [[Wide Area Network]]s (WAN) using [[X.25]] [[Point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point communication]] [[Link (telecommunications)|links]], either [[leased line]] or [[dialup]] (see also [[Data link]]). (WAN support ''did'' require manual configuration of the [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] machines.) DNET provided [[name server|named network services]], and supported a [[multicast]] protocol for finding them. [[client (computing)|Clients]] would ask for a named service, and the first respondent (of potentially many) would get the [[telecommunication circuit|connection]]. [[server (computing)|Servers]] could either be resident, in which case they registered their service name(s) with the [[protocol stack]] when they were started, or transient, in which case a fresh server was [[fork-exec|forked/execed]] for each client connection. DNET at ISC consisted of the following services: * netman (the main networking client/server support handler) * raccess (remote file access via <TT>/net/machine/path/from/raccess/root...</TT>) * rx (remote execution) * ncu (network login) * bootserver ([[diskless workstation]] [[network booting|boot service]]) * dmap (ruptime analog) There were ''many'' more services than these at a typical DNET installation - these are representative. == netman == '''netman''' was the main component of DNET. It was a [[DNIX]] [[DNIX#Handlers|Handler]], usually mounted on <TT>/netphys</TT>, and was responsible for providing all [[Layer 2]] and [[Network Layer|Layer 3]] [[X.25]] [[protocol stack|protocol]] handling. It talked to the [[Ethernet]] and [[HDLC]] device drivers. It also provided the service name registry, and the [[Wide area network|WAN]] gateway functionality. Resident [[server (computing)|server]]s could also utilize, at their instigation, a [[Network Layer|Layer 3]] [[protocol stack]] (called 'serverprot') between themselves and netman, allowing them to support up to 4095 [[client (computing)|client]] connections through one [[file descriptor]] (to netman). Such servers were called ''complex'' resident servers, so named in honor of the relatively complicated (though not large) bit of protocol code that had to be included to handle the [[multiplexing]] and [[flow control]]. Simple resident and transient servers consumed a [[file descriptor]] per client connection. It was possible to run more than one netman process, for testing or other special purposes. (Such a process would be configured to use different [[Ethertype]] and handler mount points, at a minimum.) The <TT>/usr/lib/net/servtab</TT> file was the usual location for the configuration file controlling [[Wide
