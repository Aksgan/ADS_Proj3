They add that "there is no consensus and it may be possible to safely deliver these modalities in a proper setting with device and patient monitoring", and recommend further research. The review found several reports of ICDs administering inappropriate treatment due to interference with TENS devices, but notes that the reports on pacemakers are mixed: some non-programmable pacemakers were inhibited by TENS, but others were unaffected or auto-reprogrammed.<ref>{{cite pmid|19411677}}</ref> On areas of numb skin/decreased sensation TENS should be used with caution because it's likely less effective due to nerve damage.

Such models cannot simulate the heat take up that occurs in the real ocean and were thus unable to run transient simulations: instead, the response to equilibrium change was investigated. There are problems with this approach, which were well appreciated at the time: the deep ocean has a very long time constant and in some areas (most notably the southern ocean) the transient and equilibrium responses are very different. == Model interpretation issues == In an equilibrium simulation, time is merely a label and a given year or decade does not represent the simulation of a calendar year or decade. * Thus (by definition) a portion of a simulation labelled "2000-2030" represents 30 years, but not any particular 30 years. * In a transient simulation, instead of a sudden change in greenhouse gases and other forcings, the forcings are changed gradually, either in an idealised way (1% {{CO2}} increase, for example) or a more realistic fashion (one of the scenarios described in the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]]). If the simulation is partly of the past, observed {{CO2}} levels may be used (and perhaps solar variation, and volcanic forcing). The transient simulation is intended to be a physically plausible path for the climate system to follow. Although (given natural variability) even a perfect model would not simulate the year-to-year variations seen in the real world, in an ideal model the variation from decade to decade would track that of the real world. <br style="clear:both" /> [[image:Ewtspr_hadam3h_n_081s4_002a_002a_0_0.png|550px|left|thumb]] <br style="clear:both" /> == External links == Related websites * [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm IPCC TAR glossary] * [http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/gccourse/model/co2/co2_lecture_new.html Enhanced Greenhouse Climate, Transient Climate Simulations] <br> {{Template:Atmospheric, Oceanographic and Climate Models}} [[Category:Numerical climate and weather models]] [[pl:Nierównowagowe symulacje klimatu]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38119</id> <title>Transitive reduction</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], a '''transitive reduction''' of a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is a [[Maximal element|minimal]] [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] <math>R'</math> on ''X'' such that the [[transitive closure]] of <math>R'</math> is the same as the transitive closure of ''R''.
