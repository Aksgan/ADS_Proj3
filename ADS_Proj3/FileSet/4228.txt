He is mostly known as the designer and developer of the [[Commodore 64]] games ''[[Sanxion]]'', ''[[Delta (computer game)|Delta]]'' and ''[[Quedex]]''. The games were published by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[publisher]] [[Thalamus (publisher)|Thalamus]]. ''Sanxion'' (1986) and ''Delta'' (1987) were pretty much standard-issue [[shoot 'em up]]s. ''Sanxion'' had a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] which allowed the action to be presented from two different viewpoints. The music in ''Sanxion'' and ''Delta'' has been composed by the famous [[video game music]] [[composer]] [[Rob Hubbard]]. ''Quedex'' (1987) was a game with an original idea, where the player steered a [[ball]] in a [[maze]]. Fasoulas's promising career as a game programmer was cut short when he was drafted into the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. For the [[Amiga]] Fasoulas made a game called ''Galactic'', slightly resembling ''[[Bubble Bobble]]''. The Finnish [[computer magazine]] ''[[Pelit]]'' gave the game a fairly good review. Fasoulas never found a publisher for the game, and it was finally published as a slightly unfinished [[Christmas]] edition as a [[cover disk]] in the British computer magazine ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]''. In the 1990s Fasoulas and [[Ilari Kuittinen]] founded the company [[Terramarque]] which is currently known as [[Housemarque]] after its fusion with [[Bloodhouse]]. Fasoulas is currently living in [[San Francisco]] and has no ties with the computer industry. It is rumoured that he has only ever surfed the [[Internet]] once and does not even have an [[e-mail]] account.<ref>[http://www.c64.com/articles/thalamus_history.html Thalamus History]</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *{{moby developer |id=179922 |name=Stavros Fasoulas's profile}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Fasoulas, Stavros}} [[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]] [[Category:Finnish computer programmers]] [[Category:Video game programmers]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Greek people]] {{Finland-bio-stub}} {{europe-compu-bio-stub}} [[fi:Stavros Fasoulas]] [[sv:Stavros Fasoulas]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35677</id> <title>Steam (software)</title> <text>{{Redirect3|Steampowered|For the steam engine, see [[Steam engine]]}} {{Infobox software |name = Steam |logo = [[File:Steam logo.svg|200px]] |screenshot = [[File:SteamcontentMay2010Storehighlight.jpg|250px|center]] |caption = The home page of the Steam Client for Windows |developer = [[Valve Corporation]] |released = {{Start date|2003|09|12}}<ref name="originalrelease">{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/183/|title=Steam Client Released|publisher=Valve Corporation|date=September 12, 2003|accessdate=February 3, 2008}}</ref> |frequently updated = yes |programming language = [[C++]] |platform = [[Microsoft Windows]]<br />[[Mac OS X]]<ref name="osx_announce">{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/3569/|title=Valve to Deliver Steam & Source on the Mac|date=8 March 2010|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref><br />[[PlayStation 3]] ([[#PlayStation 3|partially]])<ref name="eurogamer11-ps3" /> |size = 41.5 megabytes (Windows)<br />153.5 megabytes (Mac) |language = [[#Localization|21 languages]] |status = Active |genre = [[Content delivery]]<br />[[Digital rights management]]<br />[[Social network service|Social networking]] |license = [http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/ Steam Subscriber Agreement] ([[Proprietary software]]) |website = [http://store.steampowered.com/ store.steampowered.com] }} '''Steam''' is a [[digital distribution]], [[digital rights management]], [[multiplayer]] and communications platform developed by [[Valve Corporation]].
