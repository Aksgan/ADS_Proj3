to evacuate the Allied forces participating in the [[Namsos Campaign]]. It was also in 1940 that he invented the [[Mountbatten Pink]] naval camouflage pigment. His ship was sunk in May 1941 during the [[Battle of Crete]]. In August 1941 Mountbatten was appointed captain of [[HMS Illustrious (R87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']] which lay in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] for repairs following [[Operation Pedestal|action]] at [[Malta]] in the Mediterranean in January. During this period of relative inactivity he paid a flying visit to [[Pearl Harbor]], where he was not impressed with the poor state of readiness and a general lack of co-operation between the US Navy and US Army, including the absence of a joint HQ. Mountbatten was a favourite of [[Winston Churchill]] (although after 1948 Churchill never spoke to him again since he was famously annoyed with Mountbatten's later role in the independence of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]), and on 27 October 1941 Mountbatten replaced [[Roger Keyes]] as Chief of [[Combined Operations (United Kingdom)|Combined Operations]]. His duties in this role consisted of planning commando raids across the English Channel and inventing new technical aids to assist with opposed landings.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Mountbatten was in large part responsible for the planning and organization of [[St Nazaire Raid|The Raid at St. Nazaire]] in mid 1942: an operation resulting in the putting into disuse of one of the most heavily defended docks in Nazi-occupied France until well after war's end, the ramifications of which greatly contributed to allied supremacy in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]]. He personally pushed through the disastrous [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942 (which certain elements of the Allied military, notably [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Montgomery]], felt was ill-conceived from the start). The raid on Dieppe was widely considered to be a disaster, with casualties (including those wounded and/or taken prisoner) numbering in the thousands, the great majority of them [[Canadian]]s. Historian Brian Loring Villa concluded that Mountbatten conducted the raid without authority, but that his intention to do so was known to several of his superiors, who took no action to stop him.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Villa| first = Brian Loring| title = Unauthorized Action: Mountbatten and the Dieppe Raid| location = Toronto| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1989 | isbn= 0195408047}}</ref> Three noteworthy technical achievements of Mountbatten and his staff include: (1) the construction of an underwater oil pipeline from the English coast to Normandy, (2) an artificial harbor constructed of concrete caissons and sunken ships, and (3) the development of amphibious Tank-Landing Ships.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Another project that Mountbatten proposed to Churchill was [[Project Habakkuk]]. It was to be a massive and impregnable 600 meter aircraft carrier made from reinforced ice or "Pykrete." Habakkuk never was actualised due to its enormous price tag.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> [[Image:SE 000014 Mountbatten as SACSEA during Arakan tour.jpg|left|thumb|Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander, seen during his tour of the Arakan Front in February 1944.]] Mountbatten claimed that the lessons learned from the Dieppe Raid were necessary for planning the Normandy invasion on [[D-Day]] nearly two years later. However, military historians such as former Royal Marine [[Julian Thompson]] have written that these lessons should not have needed a debacle such as Dieppe to be recognised.<ref name=Thompson>{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Julian|authorlink=Julian Thompson|title=The Royal Marines: from Sea Soldiers to a Special Force|chapter=14.

In October 1943, Churchill appointed Mountbatten the Supreme Allied Commander [[South East Asia Command]]. His less practical ideas were sidelined by an experienced planning staff led by Lt-Col. [[James Allason]], though some, such as a proposal to launch an amphibious assault near [[Rangoon]], got as far as Churchill before being quashed.<ref>''The Hot Seat", James Allason, Blackthorn, London 2006.</ref> He would hold the post until the [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC) was disbanded in 1946. During his time as Supreme Allied Commander of the Southeast Asia Theatre, his command oversaw the recapture of [[Burma]] from the Japanese by General [[William Slim]]. His diplomatic handling of [[Joseph Stilwell|General "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell]] -- his deputy and also the officer commanding the American [[China Burma India Theatre of World War II|China Burma India Theatre]] -- and Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], leader of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] forces, was as gifted as that of General [[Dwight D.
