limitation of mechanical KVM switches is that any computer not currently selected by the KVM switch does not 'see' a keyboard or mouse connected to it. In normal operation this is not a problem, but while the machine is booting up it will attempt to detect its keyboard and mouse and either fail to boot or boot with an unwanted (e.g. mouseless) configuration. Likewise, a failure to detect the monitor may result in the computer falling back to 640x480 resolution. Thus, mechanical KVM switches may be unsuitable for controlling machines which can reboot automatically (e.g. after a power failure). Another problem encountered with mechanical devices is the failure of one or more switch contacts to make firm, low resistance electrical connections, often necessitating some wiggling or adjustment of the knob to correct patchy colors on screen or unreliable peripheral response. Gold-plated contacts improve that aspect of switch performance, but add cost to the device. Most active (electronic rather than mechanical) KVM devices provide peripheral emulation, sending signals to the computers that are not currently selected to simulate a keyboard, mouse and monitor being connected. These are used to control machines which may reboot in unattended operation. Peripheral emulation services embedded in the hardware also provides continuous support where computers require constant communication with the peripherals. Some types of active KVM switches do not emit signals that exactly match the physical keyboard, monitor, and mouse, which can result in unwanted behavior of the controlled machine(s). For example, the user of a multimedia keyboard connected to a KVM switch may find that the keyboard's multimedia keys have no effect on the controlled computer(s). == Software alternatives == {{Section OR|date=January 2010}} There are [[software]] alternatives to a [[Computer hardware|hardware]] KVM switch such as [http://www.inputdirector.com Input Director], [[Synergy+]], [[Synergy (software)|Synergy]], [[Virtual Network Computing]] (VNC), [http://www.abyssoft.com/software/teleport/ teleport] or the commercial [[Remote Desktop Protocol|Remote Desktop]], [[Multiplicity (software)|Multiplicity]], KaVoom, MaxiVista, and [[PC Anywhere]], which do the switching in software and forward input over standard network connections. This has the advantage of reducing the number of wires needed, and the screen-edge switching it provides makes it easier to forget that you are using two computers. However, there are some disadvantages. Software alternatives typically require additional software to be pre-loaded onto each one of the target servers or computers to allow clients to remotely attach to. They also can not be used when the host [[operating system]] is not installed yet or has not started: operating system installations are thus not possible nor is access to a computer's [[BIOS]] or other built-in configuration areas. Further, the software is unlikely to provide the same refresh/drawing speed as a directly connected monitor, which is especially important for video and game playback, and attempting to do so can flood the network with a lot of traffic. Finally, the software alternatives can be difficult or impossible to access if either computer is very busy or has stopped responding to network connections. ==Remote KVM devices== {{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}} There are two types of remote KVM devices that are best described as local remote and KVM over IP. ===Local remote (Including KVM over USB)=== Local remote KVM device design allows users to control computer equipment up to 1000 feet (300 m) away from the user consoles (keyboard, monitor and mouse). They include support for standard [[Category 5 cable|category 5 cabling]] between computers and users interconnected by the switch device. In contrast, [[USB]] powered KVM devices are able to control computer equipment using a combination of USB, keyboard, mouse and monitor cables of up to 5 meters.<ref>{{cite web |title = KVM2USB |url = http://www.epiphan.com/products/other-applications/kvm2usb/ |accessdate = 2010-09-29 }}</ref> Category 5 based KVM device communication uses proprietary protocols across what can be considered a "closed loop" local area network infrastructure. In contrast to remote over IP devices, users operate computers in "real time" because there is no noticeable latency in communication between user consoles and the computers. Small interface devices at the computers connect to the keyboard, [[Computer display|VDU]] and mouse ports of the computer. They convert these signals to a format suitable for category 5 cable and transmit this data to the user stations that decode it into normal analog signals suitable for the peripherals. Similar devices exist for KVM over IP that only support transmitting the signals at distances of thirty to fifty feet. While interface, switch, and user devices are interconnected using category 5 cabling and can be patched through non-active patch panels, the data signals are not the equivalent of Ethernet (see Tron: Category 5 - Ethernet vs KVM Networks [http://www.tron.com/kvm-white-papers.html]) so care must be taken not to cross connect these KVM components to Ethernet switches. Local remote KVM systems can support over 256 access points with access to over 8000 computers. The closed loop backbone is inherently secure and the long distance connectivity allows users and computer equipment to be distributed across many different locations throughout a facility. Where users need to manage the connected computers from off site locations, local remote KVM devices are configured with remote over IP KVM support. ===KVM over IP (iKVM)=== KVM over IP devices use a dedicated microcontroller and potentially specialized video capture hardware to capture the video, keyboard, and mouse signals, compress and convert them into packets, and send them over an [[Ethernet]] link to a remote console application that unpacks and reconstitutes the dynamic graphical image. This KVM over IP subsystem is typically connected to a system's standby power plane so that it's available during the entire BIOS boot process. These devices allow multiple computers to be controlled remotely across a [[wide area network]], [[local area network]] or [[telephone|telephone-line]] using the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] protocols. There are performance issues related with LAN/WAN hardware, standard protocols and network latency so user management is commonly referred to as "near real time". And, remote KVM over IP devices offer much smaller matrix frameworks. Access to most remote or "KVM" over IP devices today use a [[web browser]] but proprietary viewer software can increase performance. A consideration of
