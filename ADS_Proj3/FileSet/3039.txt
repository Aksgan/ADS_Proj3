These could range from everything from [[personal computers]] to computers operating in a [[Computer networking|network]]. A multitude of variables are considered and graphed out to diagnose the functioning capabilities of the specific computer or computer systems. A scoring system is designed for each specific system, and an over-all gradient score is given to the system being examined.

It was invented and brought to market by Natural Microsystems Inc (now NMS Communications). Used to build call center equipment using regular PCs, MVIP provides a second communications bus within the computer that can multiplex up to 256 full-duplex voice channels from one voice card to another. Digital voice, fax and video is bussed over a ribbon cable connected at the top of each ISA or PCI card. MVIP products make a PC perform like a small-scale PBX. The protocol accommodated for a variety of expansion boards, including trunk interfaces (usually [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] or [[ISDN]]), voice processing boards equipment [[speech recognition]] or fax processing. Each board could optionally provide a switch that could interconnect voice channels on the bus, allowing for a flexible routing of calls within the MVIP bus. The MVIP bus was promoted as an alternative to the then-dominant [[PEP]] bus by [[Dialogic Corporation]] which had much less capacity and was not an open standard. ==External links== *http://www.mvip.org/ *http://www.mvip.org/Overview.htm [[Category:Computer buses]] [[Category:Computer telephony integration]] {{compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>25241</id> <title>Multi-agent planning</title> <text>In [[computer science]] '''multi-agent planning''' involves coordinating the resources and activities of multiple "[[Software agent|agents]]". [[NASA]] says, "multiagent planning is concerned with [[plan|planning]] by (and for) multiple agents. It can involve agents planning for a common goal, an agent coordinating the plans (plan merging) or planning of others, or agents refining their own plans while negotiating over tasks or resources. The topic also involves how agents can do this in real time while executing plans (distributed continual planning). Multiagent scheduling differs from multiagent planning the same way planning and scheduling differ: in scheduling often the tasks that need to be performed are already decided, and in practice, scheduling tends to focus on algorithms for specific problem domains".
