These databases contain publicly-available information. ==Core Facilities== [[Image:TCAG lab.jpg|right|320px|thumb|TCAG DNA Synthesis Facility]] TCAG employs a variety of genomic technologies to support different types of experimentation. These are organized into separate Core Facilities, with dedicated managers. An integrated [[Bioinformatics]] team assists with data handling and analysis, and develops new algorithms and analytical methods. ===DNA Sequencing and Synthesis=== The DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Core Facility has a dedicated manager for DNA Synthesis. The DNA Sequencing component shares a manager with the [[The_Centre_for_Applied_Genomics#Genetic_and_Statistical_Analysis|Genetic and Statistical Analysis Core Facility]]. This latter manager is responsible for the [[genotyping]] functions within that facility. The facility uses conventional capillary [[Sanger sequencing]] on [[Applied Biosystems]] 3730xl instruments, governed by a [[Lims|Laboratory Information Management System]] (LIMS). Additionally, [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) using an [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] Genome Analyzer II, four [[Applied Biosystems]] SOLiD version 4, and a [[454 Life Sciences|454]]/[[Roche Diagnostics|Roche]] GS-FLX Titanium instrument is performed. A key component of this facility is the use of high-performance computing and [[bioinformatics]] support for NGS analysis and assembly. The [[Oligonucleotide#Synthesis|Oligonucleotide Synthesis]] component of this facility makes conventional, long (up to 120 [[DNA base|bases]]) and modified [[oligonucleotide]]s, and purifies these by desalting, cartridge or high-performance liquid chromatography ([[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]). ===Microarray and Gene Expression=== The [[Microarray]] and Gene Expression Core Facility has a dedicated manager, and operates [[Affymetrix]] and [[Agilent]] technologies. All [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] technologies are contained within the [[The_Centre_for_Applied_Genomics#Genetic_and_Statistical_Analysis|Genetic Analysis Core Facility]]. [[Affymetrix]] MegAllele and [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|Single Nucleotide Polymorphism]] (SNP) [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[Affymetrix]] [[gene expression]], tiling, [[promotor (biology)|promoter]] and [[exon]] [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], and [[Agilent]] [[oligonucleotide]] [[DNA microarray|microarrays]] are all run. Additionally, there is a wide variety of analytical [[software]] packages available for on-site data analysis. ===Cytogenomics and Genome Resources=== The Cytogenomics and Genome Resources Core Facility has a single manager between these two functions. Cytogenomics includes karyotyping and spectral (SKY) [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] (for [[mouse]], [[human]], and other species), fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization ([[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]]) mapping, transgenic insertion site mapping (G-to-FISH mapping) and clone labeling for [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]] experiments. The Genome Resources components includes a clone repository (Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) [[cDNA]] ([[mouse]] and [[human]]), genomic clones including human [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs)) and provides project consultation and design assistance ([[Annotation#Computational_biology|annotation]], database [[Information retrieval|queries]], probe selection). It also provides [[Cdna library|cDNA library]] screening and [[QPCR|quantitative PCR]]. ===Genetic and Statistical Analysis=== This Core Facility shares a manager (of the Genetic Analysis, or [[genotyping]] component) with the [[The_Centre_for_Applied_Genomics#DNA_Sequencing_and_Synthesis|DNA Sequencing and Synthesis]] facility. The Statistical Analysis component has its own dedicated manager. The Genetic Analysis area includes all [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] technologies, including genome-wide (Infinium) and custom content (iSelect and GoldenGate) [[genotyping]], [[Methylation#Biological_methylation|methylation]], [[microRNA]], and [[gene expression]] [[DNA microarray|microarrays]]. It also performs capillary-based [[genotyping]] ([[Applied Biosystems]] [[Taqman]] and SNaPshot, [[microsatellite]]s), custom [[genotyping]] (e.g. [[heteroduplex]] analysis), [[mouse]] [[genotyping]] (for cross progeny and [[genetic linkage]] analysis), and [[methylation]] analysis (for [[epigenetics]] research). The Statistical Analysis component provides project consultation and [[Statistical power|power analysis]], statistical analysis ([[Genetics|genetic]], [[DNA microarray|microarray]], and [[Biochemical pathway|pathway]] data, [[epidemiology]], [[population genetics]]), and [[copy number variation]] analysis, as well as developing new statistical methods. ===Biobanking=== The Biobanking Core Facility has its own dedicated manager. It performs [[White blood cell|white cell]] immortalization (from [[blood]]) and banking, [[fibroblast]] [[Cell culture|culture]] and banking, culture and banking of other cell types including non-human cells, [[Nuclear DNA|genomic DNA]] preparation from [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] or [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and [[Whole genome amplification|whole-genome amplification]] (WGA). ==Funding Sources== TCAG is funded by several agencies, including the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI), [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] through the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute], the [[Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation]], and the [[Wellcome Trust]]. Additionally, philanthropic donations are administered by [[Sickkids|The Hospital for Sick Children]] Foundation, and specific research projects are funded by a wide variety of agencies and charitable foundations. ==Organization and Management== ===Scientific Director=== The Scientific Director of TCAG is Dr. [[Stephen W. Scherer]], Senior Staff Scientist in [[Sickkids|The Hospital for Sick Children]]'s Research Institute, Director of the McLaughlin Centre<ref>McLaughlin Centre web page. [http://www.mcmm.ca/site3.aspx/]</ref>, and a professor at the [[University Of Toronto|University of Toronto]].<ref>Steve Scherer biographical web page. [http://www.tcag.ca/scherer/]</ref> ===Scientific Management Committee=== TCAG is governed by a Scientific Management Committee, who meet regularly to discuss high-level strategic planning.
