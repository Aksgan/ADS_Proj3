It was the first comprehensive symbolic mathematics system and one of the earliest [[knowledge based system]]s; many of its ideas were later adopted by [[Mathematica]], [[Maple (software)|Maple]], and other systems. ==Development== The project was initiated in July, 1968 by [[Carl Engelman]] <ref>[http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J83/J83-3008.pdf Carl Engelman Obituary in a Newsletter]</ref>, [[William A. Martin]] (front end, expression display, polynomial arithmetic) and [[Joel Moses]] (simplifier, indefinite integration: heuristic/Risch). Bill Martin was in charge of the project until 1971, and Moses ran it for the next decade. Engelman and his staff left in 1969 to return to [[MITRE|The MITRE Corporation]].<ref name='moses'>Joel Moses, "Macsyma: A Personal History", Invited Presentation at ''Milestones in Computer Algebra'', May 2008, Tobago [http://esd.mit.edu/Faculty_Pages/moses/Macsyma.pdf pdf]</ref> Later major contributors to the core mathematics engine were: <!-- Ordered alpha (usual custom).
