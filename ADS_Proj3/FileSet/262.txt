Around [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=35 issue 35], the comic began to develop a more polished look, with brighter highlights and sleeker lines. Onwards from 35, Haque has continued to develop this sleek, shiny appearance in the comic, lending itself to the establishment of such characters as Eve, who, being artificial, requires a slightly sharper, more technological look than the human cast. Also, as the comic progressed, the skin tones of several different characters darkened considerably. Around [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=200 issue 200], the comic made a dramatic shift in both its artistic style and storytelling, both becoming much "darker" and more mature. Individual strips still contained day-to-day jokes, but the storyline became far more sweeping and epic, in the style of printed comic books. Some of the artistic shift to pseudo-realism can be credited to Haque's interest in American comics, which generally have a grittier, harsher style than the Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] that many webcomics are based on. At the end of the "Dark Eve Saga" arc ([http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=218 issue 218]), the art style shifted back towards the more cartoon-like visuals, and the more humor-based storyline also returned. It later shifts back into the darker style with Eve's kidnapping and the following Exodus story arc. After issue 300, the art style in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=301 issue 301] began to reflect the style of comic books that Hawk enjoys. ==''Applegeeks Lite''== <!-- Commented out: [[Image:Applegeeks lite strip -1.jpg|right|thumb|325px|''Applegeeks Lite'' #001]] --> On April 18, 2006, the creators began a small, newspaper-like comic strip, along with the regular updates, dubbed ''Applegeeks Lite''. These strips are designed for simple jokes and puns rather than any real type of continuity, in order to provide an "escape" from the complexity of a plot-based webcomic.<ref name="aglite">{{cite web|last= Panagariya|first= Ananth|date= April 18, 2006| title= Ananth Panagariya comments on the launch of ''Applegeeks Lite''|url= http://www.applegeeks.com/blog_archive/view.php?id=1432 | accessdate= May 8, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060619163311/http://www.applegeeks.com/blog_archive/view.php?id=1432 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 19, 2006}}</ref> Indeed, the strips often go so far as to break the [[fourth wall]]; in the very first issue of ''Applegeeks Lite'' (as seen to the right), Hawk addresses the forum members and instructs them on how to properly spell "Ananth" - the first name of ''Applegeeks''' writer. ==Dark Horse Comic== [[Dark Horse Comics]] has announced an Applegeeks comic book starting in 2009. According to the Dark Horse website: "AppleGeeks Volume 1 will include creator commentary, a pinup gallery, and lots of other bonus material. All 184 pages will be printed in full color and will go on sale in June 2009." Volume 1 was released May 2009 and Volume 2 came out October 2009. ==Notes== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.applegeeks.com/ ''Applegeeks''] *[http://www.hawkstudios.net Mohammad Haque's personal art page] *[http://www.killboredom.com/comicSpotlight.php?cid=7 Review of ''Applegeeks''] *[http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003101.html Another review of ''Applegeeks''] *Interview with ''Applegeeks'' authors [http://theappleblog.com/2007/06/28/applegeeks-interview-part-1/ Part 1] [http://theappleblog.com/2007/07/08/applegeeks-interview-part-2/ Part 2] *http://www.darkhorse.com/Press-Releases/1588/Dark-Horse-Geeks-Out-in-2009-with-AppleGeeks-7-23-08 [[Category:2000s webcomics]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2003]] [[Category:Drama webcomics]] [[Category:Comedy webcomics]] [[Category:Anime and manga inspired webcomics]] [[Category:Fictional robots]] [[Category:Original English-language manga]] [[Category:Fandom webcomics]] [[fr:Applegeeks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2187</id> <title>Application Interface Specification</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=March 2010}} The '''Application Interface Specification''' (AIS) is a collection of open specifications that define [[Api|application programming interfaces]] (API) of the most required common functionality for building high availability applications. It is developed and published by the [[Service Availability Forum]] (SA Forum) and made freely available to the public. Besides reducing the complexity and shortening the application development time, the main purpose of the specifications is to ease the portability of applications between different middleware implementations and to admit third party developers to a field that was highly proprietary in the past. ==History== The AIS is part of the Service Availability Interfaces (SAI) of the SA Forum. The original specifications, released on April 14, 2003, were the Availability Management Framework (AMF), the Cluster Membership Service (CLM) and four other utility services (Checkpoint, Event, Message, Lock). [[Image:Classification of AIS Services.JPG|thumb|alt=Classification of AIS Services.|Figure 1: Classification of AIS services.]] Additional services were added to this set in subsequent releases. Namely: * Release 3 (January 18, 2006) added the first set of management services: Log, Notification and Information Model Management (IMM). * Release 4 (February 27, 2007) extended the utility services with Timer and Naming. * Release 5 (October 16, 2007) extended the management services with Security and added the Software Management Framework. * Release 6 (October 21, 2008) added the Platform Management Service to close the gap between AIS and HPI (Hardware Platform Interface). Today, AIS consists of 12 services and two frameworks (fig 1). The services are classified into three functional groups - AIS Platform Services, basic AIS Management Services, and general AIS Utility Services - in addition to the AIS Frameworks. Initially, the APIs were defined in [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] only, but as of July 2008, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] mapping of the different service APIs are being released incrementally. ==Service Dependencies== [[Image:Typical dependency relations between AIS services.JPGâ€Ž|thumb|left|alt=Administrative API for all services through IMM.|Figure 2: Typical dependency relations between AIS services.]] The different services and frameworks of the interface specifications have been designed to be [[Modular design|modular]] and, to a certain degree, independent of one another. This allows a system providing only AIS and no HPI to exist and vice versa. The only required architectural dependency is the dependence on the Cluster Membership Service (CLM). All AIS Services, with the exception of the Platform Management Service (PLM) and the Timer Service (TMR), depend on CLM. It is expected that all AIS Services should use the AIS Management Services for exposing their administrative interfaces, configuration,
