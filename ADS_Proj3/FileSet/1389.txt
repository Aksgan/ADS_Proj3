But it took place on a different part of the training area which was more challenging and hindered radio communication because of the dense forest. The scenarios were much more manifold than in 2006 and 2007. There were "Reconnaissance and Surveillance", "Autonomous Navigation", "Transport Convoy", "Transport Mule" and "Camp Security". This scenarios required very diverse abilities from the robot systems. Additionally one special session of the "Reconnaissance and Surveillance" scenario took place at night time, so vision systems were unusable. The run time limit was 60 minutes for a scenario run. The results of ELROB 2008 showed that remote controlled [[UGV]]s are more or less ready for deployment, but the radio communication places severe constraints on the usability of such systems. With semi autonomous assistance functions, like e.g. waypoint navigation, the robot system is much more useful while encountering bad radio communication. M-ELROB 2008 was attended by 17 teams. Eleven from Germany, two from the UK and one from Italy, the Netherlands, France and Finland, respectively. ==See also== * [[Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge]] * [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] * [[NATO]] == External links == * [http://www.elrob.org/ Official ELROB-Website] * [http://www.c-elrob.eu Official civilian ELROB-Website] * [http://www.m-elrob.eu Official military ELROB-Website] * [http://www.european-robotics.eu/index.html Official European Robotics Website] * [http://alanwinfield.blogspot.com/search?q=ELROB Extensive report of ELROB 2007 by Alan Winfield] * [http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=16699&ch=biztech Technology Review Article] [[Category:Robotics competitions]] [[Category:Driverless cars]] [[Category:Unmanned vehicles]] [[de:European Land-Robot Trial]] [[fr:European Land-Robot Trial]] [[ja:ロボットカーレース]] [[ru:European Land-Robot Trial]] [[sv:ELROB]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12604</id> <title>European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection</title> <text>{{ See also | Critical Infrastructure Protection }} {{primarysources|date=July 2010}} The '''European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection''' ('''EPCIP''') refers to the doctrine and programmes created to identify and protect [[critical infrastructure]] that, in case of fault, incident or attack, could seriously impact both the country where it is hosted and at least one other [[Member State of the European Union|European Member State]]. == History == The EPCIP came about as a result of a consultation in 2004 by the [[European Council]], seeking a programme to protect critical infrastructure through its 'Communication on Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Fight against Terrorism'. In December 2004 it endorsed the intention of the [[European Commission]] to propose a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and agreed to the creation of a European Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN). In December the European Commission issued its finalised design as a directive EU COM(2006) 786; this obliged all member states to adopt the components of the EPCIP into their national statutes. Not only did it apply to main area of the [[European Union]] but also to the wider [[European Economic Area]]. EPCIP also identified National Critical Infrastructure (NCI) where its disruption would only affect a single Member State. It set the responsibility for protecting items of NCI on its owner/operators and on the relevant Member State, and encouraged each Member State to establish its own National CIP programme. == References == {{Reflist}} * [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0786en01.pdf EU COM(2006) 786 EU ] Directive on European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection [[Category:Security engineering]] [[Category:Infrastructure]] [[Category:National security institutions]] [[Category:Infrastructure in Europe]] [[fr:Programme européen pour la protection des infrastructures critiques]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12608</id> <title>European Satellite Services Provider</title> <text>{{redirect|ESSP|the airport with this ICAO airport code|Norrköping Airport}} '''European Satellite Services Provider (ESSP)''' is a company set up to operate the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS).

It was founded in 1957, and currently has 56 member associations. It is responsible for holding various important competitions for individual players, nations and clubs in the continent. ==Founding History== The idea of an organization for table tennis in Europe came up in 1956 at [[Tokyo]]. It was first founded on March 13th, 1957, by 17 members: [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[German Democratic Republic]], [[West Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Wales]], and [[Yugoslavia]] with frenchman Jean Belot being the first President.
