branch of knowledge to a [[scientific discipline]] as well as emphasising the skills of the [[artisan]]. The English architect [[Inigo Jones]] and the Frenchman [[Salomon de Caus]] were among the first to re-evaluate and implement those disciplines that Vitruvius considered a necessary element of architecture: arts and [[science]]s based upon number and [[proportion (architecture)]]. The 16th century architect [[Palladio]] considered Vitrivius his master and guide, and made some drawings based on Vitruvius' work before conceiving his own architectural precepts. ===Astrolabe=== The earliest evidence of use of the [[stereographic projection]] in a machine is in the writing of the Roman author and architect, Vitruvius (ca. 88 - ca. 26 BC), who in De architectura describes an anaphoric clock (probably a clepsydra or [[water clock]]) in Alexandria. The clock had a rotating field of stars behind a wire frame indicating the hours of the day. The wire framework (the spider) and the star locations were constructed using the stereographic projection. Similar constructions dated from the first to third century and have been found in Salzburg and northeastern France, so such mechanisms were apparently fairly widespread among Romans. ==See also== *[[Frontinus]] *[[Naturalis Historia]] *[[Pliny the Elder]] *[[Roman architecture]] *[[Roman engineering]] *[[Roman technology]] *[[Vitruvian Man]] ==Reference works== Translated in 1914 as "Ten Books on Architecture" by [[Morris H.

Born and grew up in [[Calcutta]]. He is currently a professor of computer science and information technology in [[West Bengal]]. ==Biography == Mukhopadhyay attended [[Bengal Engineering College]] at [[Calcutta University]] and graduated with a B.E. in electronics and telecommunication engineering in 1977. He proceeded to [[The Queen's University of Belfast]] (UK) on a G.P. Ghosh Scholarship awarded by Calcutta University and was awarded a postgraduate diploma in computer science and applications in 1979. After returning to India, he had a short stint as a research scholar at [[Indian Statistical Institute]] in its electronics and communications sciences unit in Calcutta. In 1982 he was awarded an assistantship by [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in [[New Jersey]] (USA) from where he earned an M.S. in computer science in 1984. In the same year, he was inducted into the Iota Delta Chapter of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Honor Society - [[Eta Kappa Nu]] in New Jersey. He eventually received a Ph.D. (Engineering) degree majoring in computer science from [[Jadavpur University]] (India) in 1994. Title of his thesis was "Services needed to support interoperability in a distributed environment." Earlier he studied and worked in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Republic of Korea. While in the USA, he had worked at [[Bell Communications Research]], New Jersey in the area of distributed computing. He had also held senior level positions in a number of information technology organisations such as [[Tata Consultancy Services]], [http://www.dasturco.co.in/ M.N. Dastur & Company Private Limited], and [http://dcpl.net.in/ Development Consultants Group (DC Group)] in India and [[Bell Communications Research]] in the USA. He had taught at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], [[Bengal Engineering College]], and [[West Bengal University of Technology]] affiliated engineering colleges. Mukhopadhyay was a visiting professor at [[Chonbuk National University]] in the Republic of Korea. He is a Fellow of the [[Institution of Engineers]] <ref>http://www.ieindia.info/</ref>(India) and of the [http://www.iete.org/ Institution of Electronics & Telecommunications Engineers] (India). He is also a Senior Member of the [[IEEE]]<ref>http://www.ieee.org/index.html</ref> (USA), [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]<ref>http://www.acm.org/</ref> (USA), and [[Computer Society of India]]. He is a member of the All India Management Association. He is cited in the [[Who’s Who in the World]].<ref>http://www.MarquisWhosWho.com</ref> == Awards == *Peer Award, Bell Communications Research, New Jersey, USA, 1992 *Graduate Assistantship, Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey, USA, 1982–1984 *G.P.
