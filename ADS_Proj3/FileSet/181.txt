AROS, AmigaOS 3 for [[Motorola]] 680XX family of processors, [[AmigaOS 4]] for PPC family of processors and MorphOS. The project should be realized in C or C++ to grant an easy porting of the code on every platform, and the money had had being divided up to the winning team based on how much work each team member had effectively realized (for example if the anonymous person "Joe Developer" had realized 70% of the coding he had got 70% of the booty). The fact the project had to be multi-platform, and aimed at supporting all the major Amiga operating systems at the same time was the main cause of its lack of success. No any single Amiga developer could had started coding for AmiZilla as a one-man job because the effort to realize a porting of Firefox on all the Amiga systems, it should had been truly an enormous task to be accomplished, and also it was difficult to start a joined team development with various people skilled at the three main Amiga systems due to never dormant grudges that afflicted the Amiga community, that was and still is divided into three main branches (AmigaOS, AROS, MorphOS) and any branch had its loyal supporters. ==Results of the AmiZilla project== Despite of its apparent lack of success, the AmiZilla Bounty Project inspired many bounty systems that were created upon AmiZilla's example. It lead a great rampage in Amiga for the funding of any software project and help developers to gain a concrete (or even symbolic) amount of money to get a revenue for their efforts in creating or porting software for Amiga platforms. After AmiZilla there were created bounties for AROS, MorphOS and AmigaOS. Almost the whole AROS Operating System was created by hiring bounties, and also there are still ongoing MorphOS Bounty Projects like [http://www.power2people.org/ "Power2People"], or the "Amigabounty.net" for AmigaOS, etc.,etc. The whole Amiga community learned from AmiZilla how to fund the programmers that still work for this computing platform and helping to develop the software that it is needed in Amiga to live on and continue any further software development for this platform. ==Other Firefox Projects== A separate effort to port Firefox to AmigaOS 4 was started in early 2009 and still ongoing. It is named "Project [[TimberWolf Browser|Timberwolf]]". Screen shots and more information about Timberwolf was made public in November 2009, some days before AmiZilla project was closed abruptly, and then, on June 9, 2010, Timberwolf succeeded in its task to porting Firefox on Amiga OS and in fact an Alpha version was made available for free download on pages the Project Timberwolf site<ref name=FriedenHQ>{{Cite web| title = Announce of Timberwolf Alpha 1 Release | url = http://www.friedenhq.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49:timberwolf&catid=35:amigaos | publisher=Thomas Frieden and Hans-Joerg Frieden | accessdate = June 9, 2010}}</ref>. Users of AmigaOS have to get AmigaOS 4.1 Update 2 installed in order to run Timberwolf/Firefox. ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://amizilla.sourceforge.net/ Project Site] * [http://www.discreetfx.com/amizilla.html DiscreetFX page for AmiZilla] * [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/amizilla/ AmiZilla Mailing List @ Yahoo Groups] * [http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/kovu/ One developer's weblog, with news on AmiZilla] * [http://www.amigabounty.net/?function=viewproject&projectid=44 Site for Project Timberwolf, effort to port Firefox to Amiga OS 4.1 only] * [http://www.discreetfx.com/index.html DiscreetFX site] (Creators and Maintainers of the AmiZilla Bounty Project) {{AmigaOS}} {{web browsers}} {{Use mdy dates|date=September 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Amizilla}} [[Category:Web browsers for AmigaOS]] [[Category:Discontinued web browsers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1709</id> <title>Ami Harten</title> <text>{{Infobox Scientist |name = Amiram Harten |image = |image_size = |caption = |birth_date = 1947 |birth_place = |death_date = 1994 |death_place = |nationality = [[Israel]] |fields = [[Applied Mathematics]] |workplaces = [[Tel Aviv University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] |alma_mater = [[New York University]] |doctoral_advisor = [[Peter Lax]] |academic_advisors = |doctoral_students = |known_for = [[TVD scheme]]</br>[[ENO scheme]]</br>[[Shock capturing methods|Shock capturing scheme]]s |awards = |religion = |footnotes = }} '''Amiram Harten''' (1947 &ndash; 1994) was an [[United States|American]]/[[Israelis|Israeli]] [[applied mathematician]]. Harten made fundamental contribution to the development of [[high-resolution scheme]]s for the solution of [[hyperbolic partial differential equations]]. Among other contributions, he developed the [[total variation diminishing]] scheme, which gives an oscillation free solution for flow with [[Shock wave|shocks]].<ref>{{Citation | surname = Harten | given = Ami | title = High resolution schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws | journal = J.
