These techniques use evidence found in the existing technology systems that run business processes within an organization. ==Business process discovery techniques== Business process discovery techniques embody the following properties: * '''Emergent paradigm''' - Current methods are based on top-down structured manual interviews relying on second-hand representations of the business process/system behaviors. An automated discovery process relies on collecting data from the information system over a period of time. This data can then be analyzed to form a process model. *'''Automated process discovery''' – By automating the analysis of the data, the subjectivity of current manual process analysis techniques is removed. The automated system has an ingrained methodology that — through repeated trials — has been shown to accurately discover processes and process variations without bias. *'''Accurate information'''- Since the information is collected from the actual source it cannot be inaccurate, as opposed to gathering it from second party representation. *'''Complete information''' - An automated process captures all the information that is occurring within the system and represents them by time, date, user, etc.... Since the information is collected from real-time interactions, it is not subject to lost or selective memory issues. This includes completeness regarding exceptions in the processes. Often, exceptions are treated as statistical “noise,” which may exclude important inefficiencies in business processes. *'''Standardized Process''' - The automated collection of information yields process data which can be grouped, quantified and classified. This supplies a basis for the development and monitoring of both current and new processes, to which benchmarks can be assigned. These benchmarks are the root of both new process design and the determination of problem root cause. Additionally, standardized process data can set the stage for efforts at continuous process improvement. ==Application / techniques== Business Process Discovery compliments and builds upon the work in many other fields. *Business process discovery is the next level of understanding in the emerging field of [[business analytics]], which allows organizations to view, analyze and adjust the underlying structure and processes that go into day-to-day operations. This discovery includes information gathering of all of the components of a business process, including technology, people, department procedures and protocols. *Business process discovery creates a [[process master]] which compliments [[business process analysis]] (BPA). BPA tools and methodologies are well suited to top-down hierarchical process decomposition, and analysis of to-be processes. BPD provides a bottoms-up analysis that marries to the top-down to provide a complete business process, organized hierarchically by BPA. *[[Business Intelligence]] provides organizations with reporting and analytics on the data in their organizations. However, BI has no process model, awareness or analytics. BPD compliments BI by providing an explicit process view to current operations, and providing analytics on that process model to help organizations identify and act upon business process inefficiencies, or anomalies. *[[Web analytics]] are a limited example of BPD in that web analytics reconstruct the web-user’s process as they interact with a Web-site. However, these analytics are limited to the process as is contained within the session, from the users perspective and with respect to just the web-based system and process. *[[Business triage]] provides a framework for categorizing the processes identified by [[business process analysis]] (BPA) based on their relative importance to achieving a stated, measurable goal or outcome. Utilizing the same categories employed by military medical and disaster medical services, business processes are categorized as: **Essential/critical (red process) - Process essential for achieving outcomes/goals **Important/urgent (yellow process) - Process which speeds achieving outcomes/goals **Optional/supportive (green process) - Process not needed to achieve outcomes/goals Resources are allocated based on the process category with resources first dedicated to red processes, then yellow processes and finally green processes. In the event that resources become limited, resources are first withheld from Green Processes, then Yellow Processes. Resources are only withheld from Red Processes if failure to achieve outcomes/goals is acceptable. ==The purpose / example== A small example may illustrate the Business Process Discovery technology that is required today. Automated Business Process Discovery tools capture the required data, and transform it into a structured dataset for the actual diagnosis; A major challenge is the grouping of repetitive actions from the users into meaningful events. Next, these Business process discovery tools propose probabilistic process models. Probabilistic behavior is essential for the analysis and the diagnosis of the processes. The following shows an example where a probabilistic repair-process is recovered from user actions.
