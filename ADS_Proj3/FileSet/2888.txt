[[Banach space]]). Examples: ** the [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|Manhattan norm]] gives rise to the [[Manhattan distance]], where the distance between any two points, or vectors, is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates. ** The [[maximum norm]] gives rise to the [[Chebyshev distance]] or chessboard distance, the minimal number of moves a [[king (chess)|chess king]] would take to travel from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math>. * The [[British Rail]] metric (also called the [[Post Office]] metric or the [[SNCF]] metric) on a [[normed vector space]] is given by <math>d(x,y) = \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert</math> for distinct points <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and <math>d(x,x) = 0</math>. More generally <math>\lVert . \rVert</math> can be replaced with a function <math>f</math> taking an arbitrary set <math>S</math> to non-negative reals and taking the value <math>0</math> at most once: then the metric is defined on <math>S</math> by <math>d(x,y) = f(x) + f(y)</math> for distinct points <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and <math>d(x,x) = 0</math>. The name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys (or letters) to proceed via [[London]] (or [[Paris]]) irrespective of their final destination. * If <math>(M,d)</math> is a metric space and <math>X</math> is a [[subset]] of <math>M</math>, then <math>X</math> becomes a metric space by restricting <math>d</math> to <math>X \times X</math>. * The [[discrete metric]], where <math>d(x,y) = 0</math> if <math>x=y</math> and <math>d(x,y) = 1</math> otherwise, is a simple but important example, and can be applied to all non-empty sets. This, in particular, shows that for any non-empty set, there is always a metric space associated to it. Using this metric, any point is an [[open ball]], and therefore every subset is open and the space has the [[discrete topology]]. * A finite metric space is a metric space having a [[finite set|finite]] number of points. Not every finite metric space can be [[isometric|isometrically]] embedded in a [[Euclidean space]].<ref>[[Nati Linial|Nathan Linial]]. [http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304466 ''Finite Metric Spaces—Combinatorics, Geometry and Algorithms'', Proceedings of the ICM, Beijing 2002, vol. 3, pp573–586]</ref><ref>[http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/metrop.ps''Open problems on embeddings of finite metric spaces'', edited by Jirīı Matoušek, 2007]</ref> * The [[hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]] is a metric space. More generally: * If <math>M</math> is any [[connectedness|connected]] [[Riemannian manifold]], then we can turn <math>M</math> into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the [[infimum]] of the lengths of the paths (continuously differentiable [[curve]]s) connecting them. * If <math>X</math> is some set and <math>M</math> is a metric space, then the set of all [[bounded function]]s <math>f : X \rightarrow M</math> (i.e. those functions whose image is a [[bounded subset]] of <math>M</math>) can be turned into a metric space by defining <math>d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} d(f(x),g(x))</math> for any two bounded functions <math>f</math> and <math>g</math>. Here <math>\sup</math> is [[supremum]]. If <math>M</math> is complete, then this space is complete as well. * If <math>X</math> is a [[topological space|topological]] (or metric) space and <math>M</math> is a metric space, then the set of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions from <math>X</math> to <math>M</math> forms a metric space if we define the metric as above: <math>d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} d(f(x),g(x))</math> for any two bounded continuous functions <math>f</math> and <math>g</math>. If <math>M</math> is complete, then this space is complete as well. * If <math>G</math> is an [[graph theory|undirected connected graph]], then the set <math>V</math> of vertices of <math>G</math> can be turned into a metric space by defining <math>d(x,y)</math> to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. In [[geometric group theory]] this is applied to the [[Cayley graph]] of a group, yielding the [[word metric]]. * The [[Levenshtein distance]] is a measure of the dissimilarity between two [[string (computer science)|strings]] <math>u</math> and <math>v</math>, defined as the minimal number of character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform <math>u</math> into <math>v</math>. This can be thought of as a special case of the shortest path metric in a graph and is one example of an [[edit distance]]. * Given a metric space <math>(X,d)</math> and an increasing [[concave function]] <math>f : [0,\infty) \rightarrow [0,\infty)</math> such that <math>f(x) = 0</math> if and only if <math>x=0</math>, then <math>f \circ d</math> is also a metric on <math>X</math>. * Given an [[injective function]] <math>f</math> from any set <math>A</math> to a metric space <math>(X,d)</math>, <math>d(f(x), f(y))</math> defines a metric on <math>A</math>. * Using [[T-theory]], the [[tight span]] of a metric space is also a metric space. The tight span is useful in several types of analysis. * The set of all <math>m</math> by <math>n</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a metric space with respect to the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] distance <math>d(X,Y) = rank(Y - X)</math>. * The [[Helly metric]] is used in [[game theory]]. == Open and closed sets, topology and convergence == Every metric space is a [[topological space]] in a natural manner, and therefore all definitions and theorems about general topological spaces also apply to all metric spaces. About any point <math>x</math> in a metric space <math>M</math> we define the '''[[open ball]] of radius <math>r > 0</math> about <math>x</math> ''' as the set :<math>B(x;r) = \{y \in M : d(x,y) < r\}.</math> These open balls generate a topology on ''M'', making it a [[topological space]]. Explicitly, a subset <math>U</math> of <math>M</math> is called [[open set|'''open''']] if to every <math>x</math> in <math>U</math> there exists an <math>r > 0</math> such that <math>B(x;r)</math> is contained in <math>U</math>. The [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of an open set is called [[closed set|'''closed''']]. A [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the point <math>x</math> is any subset of <math>M</math> that contains an open ball about <math>x</math> as a subset. A topological space which can arise in this way from a metric space is called a '''metrizable''' space; see the article on [[metrization theorems]] for further details. A [[sequence]] (<math>x_n</math>) in a metric space <math>M</math> is said to [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to the limit <math>x \in M</math> [[iff]] for every <math>\epsilon>0</math>, there exists a natural number ''N'' such that <math>d(x_n,x) < \epsilon </math> for all <math>n > N</math>. Equivalently, one can use the general definition of convergence available in all topological spaces.
