name and a hardware address within a Port to which a peripheral controller would be assigned . A ''Trunk'' was a generic name for a controller for a number of Stream devices.A ''Stream'' was the generic name for the channel under which individual peripheral devices could be referenced. The boot process for the 2960 Series is worthy of a special mention: the OCP contained a mini OPER terminal and a cassette deck. At boot, the OCP would perform its Initial Program Load (IPL) from the nominated IPL device . The IPL code provided the means for the OCP to discover the system's hardware configuration, by enquiring down the Stream(s), Trunk(s) and Port(s) to find the default or manually elected boot device for the microcode set and/or Operating System to be booted. This process was called a GROPE or General Reconnaissance Of Peripheral Equipment. The cassette load method also allowed engineering staff to load and execute diagnostic software. == See also == * [[ICL VME|VME]] - the operating system for the ICL 2900 Series, not to be confused with a (later) embedded operating system. * [[Content Addressable File Store]] (CAFS) == References == * The ICL 2900 Series.

Originally developed in the [[1970s]] (as '''VME/B''', later '''VME 2900''') to drive ICL's then new [[ICL 2900 Series|2900 Series]] mainframes, the operating system is now known as '''OpenVME''' incorporating a [[Unix]] subsystem, and runs on [[ICL Series 39]] and Trimetra<ref>http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/EU/uk/pdflite/VME_brochure.pdf#page=3</ref> mainframe computers. == Origins == The development program for the [[ICL 2900|New Range]] system started on the merger of ICT and English Electric, and one of the fundamental decisions was that it would feature a brand new operating system. A number of different feasibility and design studies were carried out within ICL, the three most notable being: * VME/B (originally System B), targeted at large processors such as the 2970/2980 and developed in [[Kidsgrove]], [[Staffordshire]] and [[Gorton|West Gorton]], [[Manchester]] * VME/K (originally System T), targeted at the mid-range systems such as the 2960 and developed at Bracknell after the original design for these small processors, System D, was dropped * VME/T, which was never actually launched, but warrants a mention as it was conceived to support "fault tolerance", and predated the efforts of the successful American startup company [[Tandem Computers]] in this area. The chief architect of VME/B was [[Brian Warboys]], who subsequently became professor of software engineering at the [[University of Manchester]]. A number of influences can be seen in its design, for example [[Multics]] and ICL's earlier [[GEORGE (operating system)|George 3]] operating system; however it was essentially designed from scratch. ==Comparisons== VME was viewed as primarily competing with the [[System/360]] [[IBM mainframe]] as a commercial operating system, and adopted the [[EBCDIC]] [[character encoding]]. As a creation of the mid-1970s, with no constraints to be compatible with earlier operating systems, VME is in many ways more modern in its architecture than today's [[Unix]] derivatives (Unix was designed in the 1960s) or [[Microsoft Windows]] (which started as an operating system for single-user computers, and still betrays those origins). ==Nomenclature== When New Range was first launched in October 1974, its operating system was referred to as "System B". By the time it was first delivered it had become "VME/B".<ref name=campbell-kelly>{{cite book | last=Cambell-Kelly|first=Martin|title=ICL: A Business and Technical History|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1989|isbn=0198539185}}</ref> VME/K was developed independently (according to Campbell-Kelly, "on a whim of Ed Mack"), and was delivered later with the smaller mainframes such as the 2960. Following a financial crisis in 1980, new management was brought into ICL (Christopher Laidlaw as chairman, and Robb Wilmot as managing director). An early decision of the new management was to drop VME/K.<ref name="campbell-kelly"/><ref name="beacon">{{cite journal | title=Beacon 1963-7: A System Design Ahead of its Time?|last=Knight|first=Michael|url=http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/CCS/res/res43.htm#g|journal=Computer Resurrection|issue=43|year=2008}}</ref> Thus in July 1981 "VME2900" was launched: although presented to the customer base as a merger of VME/B and VME/K, it was in reality the VME/B base with a few selected features from VME/K grafted
