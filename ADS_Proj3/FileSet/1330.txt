He completed his undergraduate studies in mathematics and statistics at the [[Hebrew University]], Israel in 1978, received an M.Sc. in computer science from the The Feinberg Graduate School of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], Israel in 1980, and completed his PhD in computer science at the Hebrew University in 1983. He has made contributions in a variety of areas. Most of his work involves randomized and/or [[online algorithm]]s, stochastic processes, or the probabilistic analysis of deterministic algorithms. Particular applications include routing and communications networks, computational biology, and computational finance. He is responsible for a large body of work, including dozens of publications in journals and conferences as well as many patents. He has won several prizes, including the IBM Outstanding Innovation Award and the Levinson Prize in Mathematical Sciences. In 2002, Eli Upfal, was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]],<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/web/membership/fellows/Chronology/2002.html#U IEEE: Fellow Class of 2002].</ref> and in 2005 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].<ref>[http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=5076278&srt=alpha ACM: Fellow Award / Eli Upfal].</ref> He has an [[Erdős number]] of 2.

Let <math>R</math> be the ''rate'' of <math>C</math> and <math>\delta</math> be the ''relative distance''. Let <math>B_q(\boldsymbol{y}, \rho n) =\{ \boldsymbol{x} \in [q]^n | \Delta(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}) \le \rho n \}</math> be the ''Hamming Ball'' of radius <math> \rho n </math> centered at <math>\boldsymbol{y}</math>. Let <math> Vol_q(\boldsymbol{y}, \rho n) = |B_q(\boldsymbol{y}, \rho n)| </math> be the ''volume'' of the Hamming ball of radius <math> \rho n </math>. It is obvious that the volume of a Hamming Ball is translation invariant, i.e. irrelevant with position of </math>\boldsymbol{y}</math>. In particular, <math>B_q(\boldsymbol{y}, \rho n) =B_q(\boldsymbol{0}, \rho n) </math> With large enough <math>n</math>, the ''rate'' <math>R</math> and the ''relative distance''<math>\delta</math> satisfies the '''''Elias-Bassalygo bound''''': <math>R \le 1 - H_q( J_q(\delta))+o(1) </math> where : <math> H_q(x)\equiv_\text{def} -x\cdot\log_q{x \over {q-1}}-(1-x)\cdot\log_q{(1-x)} </math> is the ''q''-ary entropy function and : <math>J_q(\delta) \equiv_\text{def} \left(1-{1\over q}\right)\left(1-\sqrt{1-{q \delta \over{q-1}}}\right) </math> is a function related with [[Johnson bound]] To prove the Elias–Bassalygo bound, we'll need the following Lemma: ---- '''''Lemma 1''''': Given a ''q''-ary code, <math>C\subseteq [q]^n </math> and <math> 0\le e\le n</math>, there exists a Hamming ball of radius <math>e</math> with at least <math>{|C|Vol_q(0,e)} \over {q^n}</math> codewords in it. Proof of Lemma 1: We prove ''Lemma 1'' using probability method. Let's random pick a received word <math>y \in [q]^n</math>. The expected size of overlapped region between <math> C</math> and the Hamming ball centered at <math>y</math> with radius <math>e</math>, <math>|B_q(y,e) \cap C|</math> is <math>Vol_q(y,e) {{|C|} \over {q^n}}</math> since <math>y</math> is (uniform) randomly selected. Since this is the expected value of the size, there must exist at least one <math>y</math> such that <math>|B_q(y,e) \cap C| \ge Vol_q(y,e) {{|C|} \over {q^n}} = {{|C|Vol_q(0,e)} \over {q^n}}</math>, otherwise the expectation must be smaller than this value.
