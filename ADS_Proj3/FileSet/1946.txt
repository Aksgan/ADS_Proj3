The computer was known as MESM (''МЭСМ'', ''Малая Электронно-Счетная Машина'', ''Small Electronic Calculating Machine''), and became operational in 1950.

Seven Strelas were manufactured in [[Moscow]] by a factory in the [[Ministry of Instrument Making and Automation Means]] of the USSR; they were the primary [[debugging]] platforms for computing, and the most productive computers in the Soviet Union during this period. Strelas could process 2000 instructions per second. The last version of Strela used a 4096-word [[magnetic drum]], rotating at 6000 [[rpm]]. Other computers include, [[BESM-6]], [[Ural (computer)|Ural]], [[Setun]], [[ES EVM]], [[Minsk family of computers|Minsk]], and [[Elbrus (computer)|Elbrus]]. ===Workstations=== Workstations built in the Soviet Union include the [[SM EVM]], ES-1845, and [[DVK]]. ===Personal and home computers=== Personal computers include the [[Agat computer]], [[Korvet]], [[Elektronika BK]], [[UKNC]], [[Mikrosha]], [[Raduga]], [[Poisk (computer)|Poisk]], [[Iskra (computer)|Iskra]], [[Irisha]], and [[Dubna 48K]]. ====Micro-80==== Micro-80 was the first DIY [[home computer]]. Schematics and information were published in the popular local DIY electronic magazine ''Radio'' in 1983. It was complex, using an [[Intel 8080]]-based system which contained about 200 ICs. This system gained low popularity, but set a precedent in getting attention of hobbyist for DIY computers, and later other DIY computers were published by Radio and other DIY magazines. ====Radio-86RK==== The Radio-86RK was the second DIY computer featured in ''Radio'' magazine, in an edition published in 1986. It was more popular than the Micro-80 because it was much simpler (29 IC's, i8080 @1.78 MHz with i8257 and i8275 based CRT terminal). Many factories started production of home computers based on this design (such as the Apogey BK-01, Mikrosha, Krista, Partner 01.01, and the Spektr-001). These computers had limited compatibility with the original software, although their schematics were very close to the original.
