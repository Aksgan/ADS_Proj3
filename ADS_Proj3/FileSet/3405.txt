Both tests were conducted at the [[White Sands Missile Range]]. == Orion == [[Image:Orion Pad Abort Test Concept.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of an [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] pad abort test.]] The Orion Pad Abort Test will start with the construction of the first Orion Boilerplate. It will be a basic mockup [[prototype]] to test the assembling sequences and launch procedures at NASA’s [[Langley Research Center]] while Lockheed aerospace engineers assemble the first rocket motors for the spacecraft’s escape tower. The first Pad Abort Tests trials of the escape tower system will be at New Mexico’s [[White Sands Missile Range]] in 2008. [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp. was awarded the contract to build Orion on Aug. 31, 2006. {{See|Boilerplate (spaceflight)#Orion Boilerplate}}<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/main/index.html NASA's Project Constellation] Official Site</ref> {{see also | List of Constellation missions}} == See also == [[Soyuz T-10-1]] mission was unsuccessful; however the [[launch escape system]] worked perfectly and saved the two cosmonauts on board: {{See|Soyuz T-10-1#Mission highlights}} == References == {{reflist}} * [[Project Mercury]] * [[Project Apollo]] [[Category:Human spaceflight]] [[Category:Safety engineering]] [[Category:Spacecraft components]] [[es:Prueba de aborto en plataforma]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28282</id> <title>Paedophile Unit</title> <text>The '''Paedophile Unit''' is a branch of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[London]] [[Metropolitan Police Service]]'s [[Child Abuse Investigation Team|Child Abuse Investigation Command]], based at [[Scotland Yard]].

It is a so-called "[[game with a purpose]]", as it pursues additional goals: not only to provide entertainment but also to harness human computation for some specific research task. The term "games with a purpose" was coined by Luis von Ahn, inventor of CAPTCHA, co-organizer of reCAPTCHA project, and inventor of a famous [[ESP Game]]<ref>L. von Ahn: “Games with a purpose”. Computer, vol. 29(6), pp. 92–94, 2006.</ref>. ==Game rules== Page Hunt is only accessible through [[Internet Explorer]], and requires [[Silverlight]] (freely downloadable from the Page Hunt website). Unlike the games of Luis von Ahn, Page Hunt is a single-player game. It doesn't support [[user registration]] (and hence doesn't rank players). Shown a webpage, the player must find the best [[Index term|keyword]] or keywords which would bring this page to the list of top 5 search results by Bing. The higher is the rank of the page within 5 first results, the more points the player gets. Achieving this without frequent queries earns a bonus. The game lasts for 3 minutes. ==Scientific results== The data gained using Page Hunt has several applications: # providing metadata for pages, # providing query alterations for use in query refinement, # identifying ranking issues. On testing a game internally, the following results were gathered (as described in “Page Hunt: Improving search engines using human
