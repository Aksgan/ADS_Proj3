A paradoxical decomposition of a set is a [[partition of a set|partitioning]] of the set into exactly two subsets, along with an appropriate [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of functions that operate on some universe (of which the set in question is a subset), such that each partition can be mapped back onto the entire set using only finitely many distinct functions (or compositions thereof) to accomplish the mapping. Since a paradoxical set as defined requires a suitable group <math>G</math>, it is said to be <math>G</math>-paradoxical, or paradoxical with respect to <math>G</math>. Paradoxical sets exist as a consequence of the [[Axiom of Infinity]]. Admitting infinite classes as sets is sufficient to allow paradoxical sets. == Examples == === Natural numbers === An example of a paradoxical set is the [[natural numbers]]. They are paradoxical with respect to the group of functions <math>G</math> generated by the natural function <math>f</math>: <math> f(n) = \begin{cases} n/2, & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\ (n+1)/2, & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} \end{cases} </math> Split the natural numbers into the odds and the evens. The function <math>f</math> maps both sets onto the whole of <math>\mathbb{N}</math>. Since only finitely many functions were needed, the naturals are <math>G</math>-paradoxical. === Banach–Tarski paradox === {{main|Banach–Tarski paradox}} The most famous, and indeed motivational, example of paradoxical sets is the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]], which divides the sphere into paradoxical sets for the [[special orthogonal group]]. This result depends on the [[axiom of choice]]. == References == * S.
