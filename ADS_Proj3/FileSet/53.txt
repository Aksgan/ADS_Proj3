In 2004, the [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]] selected it as a standard cryptographic technique. The algorithm uses a [[substitution-permutation network]] structure based on [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]. The interface is the same as AES: 128-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] with [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The number of rounds is 12, 14, or 16, depending on the key size. ARIA uses two 8&times;8-bit [[substitution box|S-boxes]] and their inverses in alternate rounds; one of these is the [[Rijndael S-box]]. The [[key schedule]] processes the [[key (cryptography)|key]] using a 3-round 256-bit [[Feistel cipher]], with the binary expansion of 1/[[pi|''π'']] as a source of "[[nothing up my sleeve number]]s". ==References== * {{cite paper | author = [[Alex Biryukov|A.

As such, it is sometimes described as the new [[Noah’s Ark]], or the Noah’s Ark of the online era. ==History== [[Image:David Attenborough.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[David Attenborough]] and the ARKive]] The project was launched in May [[2003]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}<!-- ARKive already had a publically visible website before 2000, the first HP-sponsored site re-launched at the 2000 Wildscreen Festival and a further site in 2002 --> by its patron, the [[UK]]-based natural history presenter, [[Sir David Attenborough]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,969572,00.html|publisher=''The Guardian''|title=Arkive sets sail on the web|accessdate=2007-07-02 | location=London | first=Ashley | last=Davies | date=2003-05-20}}</ref> a long-standing colleague and friend of its chief instigator, the late [[Christopher Parsons]], a former Head of the [[BBC Natural History Unit]]. Parsons identified a need to provide a centralised safe haven for wildlife films and photographs after discovering that many such records are held in scattered, non-indexed, collections, often with little or no public access, and sometimes in conditions that could lead to loss or damage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,839405,00.html|publisher=''The Guardian''|title=Christopher Parsons|accessdate=2007-07-02 | location=London | date=2002-11-14 | first=Barry | last=Paine}}</ref> He believed the records could be a powerful force in building environmental awareness by bringing [[scientific]] names to life. He also saw their [[film preservation|preservation]] as an important educational resource and conservation tool, not least because extinction rates and habitat destruction could mean that images and sounds might be the only legacy of some species’ existence. His vision of a permanent, accessible, refuge for audio-visual wildlife material won almost immediate support from many of the world’s major broadcasters; leading film and photographic libraries, international conservation organisations and academic institutes. Work on building ARKive began as part of the UK’s [[Millennium]] [[2000]] celebrations, using advanced computerised storage and retrieval technology devised for the project by [[Hewlett Packard]] Laboratories Europe. By the launch date, the project team had researched, catalogued, copied, described and authenticated image, sound and fact files of 1,000 [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[fungi]], many of them critically [[endangered]]. More multi-media profiles are added every month, starting with British [[flora]] and [[fauna]] and with species included on the [[Red List]] – that is, species that are believed to be closest to [[extinction]], according to research by the [[World Conservation Union]]. By January [[2006]], the database had grown to 2,000 species, 15,000 still images and more than 50 hours of video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/pressReleases/suntimes010106.html|publisher=''ARKive''|title=ARKive named as Sunday Times website of the year|accessdate=2007-07-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609145850/http://www.arkive.org/pressReleases/suntimes010106.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-09}}</ref>. The ARKive project is an initiative of [[Wildscreen]], a UK-registered educational charity, based in [[Bristol]], and working globally to increase the public’s understanding and appreciation of biodiversity, through the power of wildlife imagery. ==See also== *[[Catalogue of Life]] *[[Encyclopedia of Life]] *[[List of online encyclopedias]] *[[Macroscopic Observatory]] *[[Nature documentary]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.arkive.org Official ARKive site.] * [http://www.wildscreen.org Official Wildscreen site.] {{DEFAULTSORT:Arkive}} [[Category:Scientific classification]] [[Category:Virtual museums]] [[Category:Online encyclopedias]] [[Category:Biological databases]] [[af:ARKive]] [[ca:ARKive]] [[hu:ARKive – Veszélyeztetett fajok]]</text> </page> <page>
