As an example, dictated words appear in a floating [[tooltip]] as they are spoken (though there is an option to set this feature so it is not displayed to increase speed), and when the speaker pauses, the program [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribes]] the words into the [[active window]] at the location of the cursor. The software has three primary areas of functionality: dictation, text-to-speech and command input. The user is able to dictate and have their speech transcribed as written text, have a document synthesized as an audio stream, or issue commands that are recognized as such by the program. In addition, voice profiles can be accessed through different computers in a networked environment, although the audio hardware and configuration must be identical on both machines. The Professional version allows creation of custom commands to control programs or functions not built into NaturallySpeaking. ==History== Dr. James and Janet Baker founded Dragon Systems in 1982 to release products centered around their voice recognition prototype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragon-medical-transcription.com/history_speech_recognition.html | title=Dragon Systems history |accessdate =2010-02-03}}</ref> [[DragonDictate]] was first released for [[DOS]], and utilized [[hidden Markov models]], which is a statistical method for the recognition of speech. At the time, the hardware was insufficiently powerful to address the problem of [[word segmentation]], and DragonDictate was unable to determine the boundaries of words during continuous speech input. Users were forced to pronounce one word at a time, each clearly separated by a small pause. DragonDictate was based on a [[trigram]] model, and is known as a discrete utterance speech recognition engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/a2x-voice/dd-faq.html#What | title=DragonDictate product information |accessdate = 2010-02-03}}</ref> Dragon Systems released NaturallySpeaking 1.0 as their first continuous dictation product in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragon-medical-transcription.com/history_speech_recognition.html | title=Dragon NaturallySpeaking 1.0 released |accessdate =2010-02-03}}</ref> The company was then purchased in June 2000 by [[Lernout & Hauspie]], a corporation that had been involved in financial scandals as reported by the [[New York Times]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/business/dragon-systems-sputters-after-belgian-suitor-fails.html?pagewanted=all | title=Dragon Systems purchased by Lernout & Hauspie | accessdate=2010-02-03 |date=2001-05-07 |work=New York Times}}</ref> Following the bankruptcy of Lernout & Hauspie, the rights to the Dragon product line were acquired by [[ScanSoft]].

Dreamwidth also provides shared or group journals called "communities". Areas in which Dreamwidth differs significantly from Livejournal include the following: ==== Accounts ==== Free accounts may only be created with an invite code, and have limited features. Paid accounts exist on two levels, "Paid" and "Premium Paid", and have additional features.<ref>[http://www.dreamwidth.org/support/faqbrowse?faqid=4 FAQ: What are paid accounts?]</ref> At the time of the open beta launch, a limited number of Seed Accounts were also available. ==== User relationships ==== In response
