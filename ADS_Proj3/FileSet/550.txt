The '''Business Operating System''', or '''BOS''', is an early [[cross-platform]] [[operating system]] originally produced for [[Intel 8080]] and [[Motorola 6800]] [[computer]]s, subsequently for [[Zilog Z80]]-based computers, and then later for most [[microcomputer]]s of the 1980s. [[CAP Ltd]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] company and at the time one of the world's largest [[Information Technology]] consulting firms, developed BOS. CAP designed BOS and BOS applications for [[platform-independent|platform-independence]]. Via a [[management buyout]] (MBO) in 1981, BOS was spun off to three interlinked companies, MPSL (MicroProducts Software Ltd) which looked after the sales and marketing of BOS, MPPL (MicroProducts Programming Ltd) which looked after both the development of BOS and various horizontal software packages, and MicroProducts Training Ltd. BOS was distributed on a global basis, mainly to the United States and British Commonwealth, by a variety of independent and MPSL-owned companies. The small BOS dealer/distributor network and its [[command line interface]] structure met its demise when [[graphical user interface]] operating systems became prevalent. MPSL developed numerous products for BOS, generally targeting the horizontal markets, leaving the vertical markets (i.e. niche) to independent software vendors [[ISV]]. Examples of MPSL developed software include [[BOS/Finder]] ([[database]]), [[BOS/Planner]] ([[spreadsheet]]), BOS/Writer (word processor) and [[BOS/AutoClerk]] ([[report generation]]). Companies sold various BOS [[accounting software]] suites in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and United States. In the UK, BOS accounting packages were considered to be the industry standard by some accountants. BOS applications were compiled to a ''[[p-code machine|p-code]]'' and [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreted]] as they ran. BOS had a p-code interpreter so efficient that programs, even the [[BOS/Writer]] [[word processor]], ran sufficiently fast to satisfy users. Apart from a 2-[[kilobyte]] (Kb) [[server (computing)/host]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], BOS is written in [[BOS/MicroCobol]], a language based on [[COBOL]] but with system level programming constructs added and elements of structured programming, which bore a vague similarity to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. In recent computing, programming languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] have re-introduced the concept of p-code "[[virtual machine]]s". BOS required 48 Kb of [[RAM]] and two 250 Kb [[floppies]], though it was more commonly deployed on machines equipped with 64 [[kilobytes]] of RAM and a [[hard drive]]. A computer with 128 [[kilobyte|KB]] RAM and a 10-megabyte (Mb) hard drive could run as many as five [[concurrent user]]s. When the [[IBM PC XT]] came out in 1983, BOS served over eight concurrent [[dumb terminals]] on it. At the time, this made BOS very attractive. With user-management tools and [[application programming interface]]s, BOS was considered an alternative even to the platform-specific operating systems on machines such as the [[PDP-11]] and the [[VAX]]. Despite, or because of its command line interface, BOS remains popular with medium to large organizations in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} == Other use == The phrase "Business Operating System" or "BOS" is also utilized to describe the standard, enterprise-wide collection of [[business process]]es used in many diversified industrial companies such as [[Ingersoll Rand]], [[Honeywell]], or [[Danaher]]. Each of these companies have adopted a standard, common collection of business processes and/or [[business process management|business process improvement methodologies]]. Specifically, Ingersoll Rand has established the Ingersoll Rand Business Operating System (BOS) to describe the six Enterprise Focus Areas—or strategic areas of focus—and its process improvement method known as [[Lean Six Sigma]]. Similarly, Honeywell has established the Honeywell Operating System (HOS) and Danaher is well known for its Danaher Business System (DBS). While these standard Business Operating Systems may inform or be linked to a company's technology platform, they more commonly refer to the way the company manages complex business processes in a common way across its diverse portfolio of businesses. ==References== * [http://www.global3000.com/comphist.html History of BOS Software Ltd] * [http://www.atarimagazines.com/startspe1/business.html STart Magazine: Business Operating System on Atari ST] [[Category:Operating systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4783</id> <title>Business activity monitoring</title> <text>{{noref|date=September 2010}} '''Business activity monitoring''' ('''BAM''') is [[software]] that aids in monitoring of business activities, as those activities are implemented in [[computer system]]s. ==Description== The term "business activity monitoring" was originally coined by analysts [[Gartner|Gartner, Inc.]] and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. A business activity can either be a business process that is orchestrated by [[business process management]] (BPM) software, or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management. ==Goals and benefits== The goals of business activity monitoring are to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions. The main benefits of BAM are to enable an enterprise to make better informed business decisions, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities. ==Key features== One of the most visible features of BAM solutions is the presentation of information on dashboards that contain [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance. This information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility, measurement, and assurance of key business activities. It is also exploited by [[event correlation]] to detect and warn of impending problems. Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by [[business intelligence]] (BI) insofar as events are processed in real-time or near real-time and pushed to the dashboard in BAM systems, whereas BI dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases. Depending on the refresh interval selected, BAM and BI dashboards can be similar or vary widely. Some BAM solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions, which allows them to interact automatically with the trouble-ticket system. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated problem solving, where feasible, can correct and restart failed processes. ==Deployment effort== In nearly all deployments of BAM solutions, extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required. Many BAM solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written
