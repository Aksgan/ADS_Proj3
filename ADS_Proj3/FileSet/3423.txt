if ''A'' is true * ''A or B'' is true if and only if ''A'' is true or ''B'' is true * ''A or B'' is false if and only if ''A'' is false and ''B'' is false (Semantic) logical consequence is then defined as truth-preservation: : <math>\Gamma\vDash A</math> if and only if <math>A\,</math> is true whenever every element of <math>\Gamma\,</math> is true. Now consider a valuation <math>V\,</math> such that <math>V(A,1)\,</math> and <math>V(A,0)\,</math> but it is not the case that <math>V(B,0)\,</math>. It is easy to check that this valuation constitutes a [[counterexample]] to both explosion and disjunctive syllogism. However, it is also a counterexample to [[modus ponens]] for the [[material conditional]] of LP. For this reason, proponents of LP usually advocate expanding the system to include a stronger conditional connective that is not definable in terms of negation and disjunction.<ref>See, for example, Priest (2002), §5.</ref> As one can verify, LP preserves most other inference patterns that one would expect to be valid, such as [[De Morgan’s laws]] and the usual [[Natural deduction|introduction and elimination rules]] for negation, [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], and disjunction. Surprisingly, the [[logical truth]]s (or [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]) of LP are precisely those of classical propositional logic.<ref>See Priest (2002), p. 310.</ref> (LP and classical logic differ only in the ''[[inference]]s'' they deem valid.) Relaxing the requirement that every formula be either true or false yields the weaker paraconsistent logic commonly known as FDE (“[[First-Degree Entailment]]”). Unlike LP, FDE contains no logical truths. It must be emphasized that LP is but one of ''many'' paraconsistent logics that have been proposed.<ref>Surveys of various approaches to paraconsistent logic can be found in Bremer (2005) and Priest (2002), and a large family of paraconsistent logics is developed in detail in Carnielli, Congilio and Marcos (2007).</ref> It is presented here merely as an illustration of how a paraconsistent logic can work. == Relation to other logics == One important type of paraconsistent logic is [[relevance logic]]. A logic is ''relevant'' [[iff]] it satisfies the following condition: : if ''A'' → ''B'' is a theorem, then ''A'' and ''B'' share a [[logical constant|non-logical constant]]. It follows that a relevance logic cannot have (''p'' ∧ ¬''p'') → ''q'' as a theorem, and thus (on reasonable assumptions) cannot validate the inference from {''p'', ¬''p''} to ''q''. Paraconsistent logic has significant overlap with [[many-valued logic]]; however, not all paraconsistent logics are many-valued (and, of course, not all many-valued logics are paraconsistent). [[Intuitionistic logic]] allows ''A'' ∨ ¬''A'' not to be equivalent to true, while paraconsistent logic allows ''A'' ∧ ¬''A'' not to be equivalent to false. Thus it seems natural to regard paraconsistent logic as the “[[duality (mathematics)|dual]]” of intuitionistic logic. However, intuitionistic logic is a specific logical system whereas paraconsistent logic encompasses a large class of systems. Accordingly, the dual notion to paraconsistency is called [[paracomplete logic|paracompleteness]], and the “dual” of intuitionistic logic (a specific paracomplete logic) is a specific paraconsistent system called ''anti-intuitionistic'' or ''dual-intuitionistic logic'' (sometimes referred to as ''Brazilian logic'', for historical reasons).<ref>See Aoyama (2004).</ref> The duality between the two systems is best seen within a [[sequent calculus]] framework. While in intuitionistic logic the sequent : <math>\vdash A \lor \neg A</math> is not derivable, in dual-intuitionistic logic : <math>A \land \neg A \vdash</math> is not derivable. Similarly, in intuitionistic logic the sequent : <math>\neg \neg A \vdash A</math> is not derivable, while in dual-intuitionistic logic : <math>A \vdash \neg \neg A</math> is not derivable. Dual-intuitionistic logic contains a connective # known as ''pseudo-difference'' which is the dual of intuitionistic implication. Very loosely, {{nowrap|1=''A'' # ''B''}} can be read as “''A'' but not ''B''”. However, # is not [[truth-functional]] as one might expect a ‘but not’ operator to be; similarly, the intuitionistic implication operator cannot be treated like "{{nowrap|1=¬ (''A'' ∧ ¬''B'')}}". Dual-intuitionistic logic also features a basic connective ⊤ which is the dual of intuitionistic ⊥: negation may be defined as {{nowrap|1=¬''A'' = (⊤ # ''A'')}} A full account of the duality between paraconsistent and intuitionistic logic, including an explanation on why dual-intuitionistic and paraconsistent logics do not coincide, can be found in Brunner and Carnielli (2005). == Applications == Paraconsistent logic has been applied as a means of managing inconsistency in numerous domains, including:<ref name="See Bremer">Most of these are discussed in Bremer (2005) and Priest (2002).</ref> * [[Semantics]]. Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as means of providing a simple and intuitive formal account of [[truth]] that does not fall prey to paradoxes such as [[Liar paradox|the Liar]]. However, such systems must also avoid [[Curry’s paradox]], which is much more difficult as it does not essentially involve negation. * [[Set theory]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]] (see [[paraconsistent mathematics]]). Some believe{{Who|date=September 2008}} that paraconsistent logic has significant ramifications with respect to the significance of [[Russell’s paradox]] and [[Gödel’s incompleteness theorems]]{{Dubious|Incompleteness theorem|date=November 2008}}. * [[Epistemology]] and [[belief revision]]. Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as a means of reasoning with and revising inconsistent theories and belief systems. * [[Knowledge management]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Some [[computer scientist]]s have utilized paraconsistent logic as a means of coping gracefully with inconsistent information.<ref>See, for example, the articles in Bertossi et al. (2004).</ref> * [[Deontic logic]] and [[metaethics]]. Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as a means of dealing with ethical and other normative conflicts. * [[Software engineering]]. Paraconsistent logic has been proposed as a means for dealing with the pervasive inconsistencies among the [[documentation]], [[use cases]], and [[Source code|code]] of large [[software systems]].<ref name="Hewitt 2008a"/><ref name="Hewitt 2008b"/> * [[Electronics]] design routinely uses a [[four valued logic]], with “hi-impedance (z)” and “don’t care (x)” playing similar roles to “don’t know” and “both true and false” respectively, in addition to True and False. This logic was developed independently of Philosophical logics. == Criticism == Some philosophers have argued against paraconsistent logic on the ground that the counterintuitiveness of giving up any of the three principles above outweighs any counterintuitiveness that the principle of explosion might have. Others, such as [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], have objected to paraconsistent logic on the ground that it is
