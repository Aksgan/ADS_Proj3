Users become ''Founders'' of a spot by dropping an item there. Items form a key feature within the game and each user has a vault into which they can place items they want to keep forever. Special items have been created for specific events of importance such as the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympic Games]], and also as promotional items linked to real-world prizes.

The GP2X version is similar to the PSP one, but typically slower. Unlike [[VisualBoyAdvance]], which [[High-level emulation|high-level emulates]] the GBA BIOS,<ref>[http://vba.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vba/VisualBoyAdvance/src/bios.cpp?view=log Source code of GBA BIOS reimplementation in VisualBoyAdvance]</ref> gpSP requires a GBA BIOS file in order to operate. Due to copyright reasons, this BIOS cannot be included with the emulator by Exophase, and users must dump it on their own using a [[Game Boy Advance flash cartridge]]. To date, gpSP has proven to be the most efficient, compatible and widely used of all GBA emulators for the PSP, GP2X and the iPhone.
