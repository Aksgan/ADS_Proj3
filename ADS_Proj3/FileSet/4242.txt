Meyer's paper. But having that authority does not excuse the professional and ethical misjudgments. If you know that the publication of a pro-ID paper in a Smithsonian journal is going to cause an outcry, and you have close ties to the ID movement and to the author of this paper specifically, the ethical thing to do would be to excuse yourself from handling that paper and allow someone without those personal and professional ties to the author and subject of the paper to decide whether it should be published. Thus, Sternberg's decision to publish the paper without the normal peer-review process is a flagrant breach of professional ethics that brought disrepute to the Smithsonian."|Ed Brayton|The Richard Sternberg Affair}} Doubts were raised whether the reviewers were evolutionary biologists.<ref name="saa"/> According to an article by the Society of Academic Authors Meyer said the article grew out of a presentation he made at a conference attended by Richard Sternberg where they discussed the possibility of a paper for society's journal.<ref name="saa"/> Observers have pointed to affiliations that in most circumstances would have disqualified Sternberg from reviewing an article on intelligent design.<ref name="holy_grail">{{cite journal | url = http://www.talkreason.org/articles/holy.cfm | title = Creationism's Holy Grail: The Intelligent Design of a Peer-Reviewed Paper | first = R | last = Weitzel | journal = [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 66–69 | accessdate = 2010-04-22 | date = 2005-08-28 }}</ref> They note that Sternberg is a Fellow of the [[International Society for Complexity, Information and Design]], a Discovery Institute-affiliated group dedicated to promoting intelligent design.

There was substantial feedback from reviewers to the author, resulting in significant changes to the paper. The reviewers did not necessarily agree with Dr. Meyer's arguments or his conclusion but all found the paper meritorious and concluded that it warranted publication...four well-qualified biologists with five PhDs in relevant disciplines were of the professional opinion that the paper was worthy of publication."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rsternberg.net/publication_details.htm | title = Details of publication process | last = Sternberg | first = R | accessdate = 2010-04-24 | publisher = rsternberg.net }}</ref>}} Of the four "well-qualified biologists with five PhDs" Sternberg identifies, one was Sternberg himself, contributing his double doctorate to the total he cited. Sternberg's claim of following proper peer review procedures directly contradicts the published public statement of his former employer, the publisher of the journal, that the proper procedures were not followed resulting in the article's retraction.<ref name="statement"/> In previous years the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington had published yearly lists of all the people who had served as peer reviewers. That list is absent for 2004, the year of the incident.
