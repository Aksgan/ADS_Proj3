In other words, a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] algorithm does not gamble with the verity of the result; it only gambles with the resources used for the computation. A simple example is randomized [[quicksort]], where the pivot is chosen randomly, but the result is always sorted. The usual definition of a Las Vegas algorithm includes the restriction that the ''expected'' run time always be finite, when the expectation is carried out over the space of random information, or entropy, used in the algorithm. Las Vegas algorithms were introduced by [[László Babai]] in 1979, in the context of the [[graph isomorphism problem]], as a stronger version of [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s.<ref>[[László Babai]], [http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/lasvegas79.pdf Monte-Carlo algorithms in graph isomorphism testing], Université de Montréal, D.M.S. No. 79-10.</ref><ref>[[Leonid Levin]], [http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CR/0012023 The Tale of One-way Functions], ''Problems of Information Transmission'', vol. 39 (2003), 92-103.</ref><ref>Dan Grundy, [http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/eab2/crypto/thesis.web.pdf Concepts and Calculation in Cryptography], University of Kent, Ph.D. thesis, 2008</ref> Las Vegas algorithms can be used in situations where the number of possible solutions is relatively limited, and where verifying the correctness of a candidate solution is relatively easy while actually calculating the solution is complex. == Complexity class == The [[complexity class]] of [[decision problem]]s that have Las Vegas algorithms with [[expected value|expected]] polynomial runtime is '''[[Zero-error_Probabilistic_Polynomial_time | ZPP]]'''. It turns out that :<math>\textrm{ZPP} = \textrm{RP} \cap \,\text{co}\,\textrm{-RP}, \,\!</math> which is intimately connected with the way Las Vegas algorithms are sometimes constructed. Namely the class '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' consists of all decision problems for which a randomized polynomial-time algorithm exists that always answers correctly when the correct answer is "no", but is allowed to be wrong with a certain probability bounded away from one when the answer is "yes". When such an algorithm exists for both a problem and its complement (with the answers "yes" and "no" swapped), the two algorithms can be run simultaneously and repeatedly: a few steps of each, taking turns, until one of them returns a definitive answer. This is the standard way to construct a Las Vegas algorithm that runs in expected polynomial time. Note that in general there is no worst case upper bound on the run time of a Las Vegas algorithm. == Relation to Monte Carlo algorithms == Las Vegas algorithms can be contrasted with Monte Carlo algorithms, in which the resources used are bounded but the answer is not guaranteed to be correct 100% of the time. By an application of [[Markov's inequality]], a Las Vegas algorithm can be converted into a Monte Carlo algorithm via early termination (assuming the algorithm structure provides for such a mechanism). == See also == * [[Randomness]] * [[Monte Carlo algorithm]] ==Notes == {{reflist}} ==References== * ''Algorithms and Theory of Computation Handbook'', CRC Press LLC, 1999, "Las Vegas algorithm", in ''Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures'' [online], Paul E.

[[Konami]] originally released the peripheral in 1990, in [[Japan]] for the [[Famicom]] under the name '''Gun Sight'''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The LaserScope was manufactured specifically for one [[Konami]] game, ''[[Laser Invasion]]'', but could be used with any game that used the [[NES Zapper]] as a peripheral.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The system did not use an actual gun, but instead was a headset with a microphone and a laser-guided crosshair that covered one eye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nesplayer.com/database/accessories/laserscope.htm |title=Accessories: Konami Laser Scope |publisher=NES Player |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref> The LaserScope was powered through the audio port of the NES, which enabled the user to hear the game audio as well. All a user was required to do was say "fire" and the gun, supposedly, would fire at the target. However, the peripheral would often malfunction and fire at any background noise, which led to the negative reception the LaserScope eventually received. ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Nintendo hardware|NES}} {{videogame-hardware-stub}} {{Konami-stub}} [[Category:Nintendo Entertainment System accessories]] [[Category:Light guns]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21204</id> <title>Late Move Reductions</title> <text>'''Late Move Reductions''' (LMR) is a non-game specific enhancement to the [[alpha-beta pruning|alpha-beta algorithm]] and its variants which attempts to examine a [[game tree|game search tree]] more efficiently.

If a cut-off is going to happen in a search, the first few moves are the ones most likely to cause them. In games like [[chess]], most
