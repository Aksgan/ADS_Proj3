She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".<ref name=rs1/> At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]] for an audition in the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Cassella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a [[New York City]] talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role, as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'', as well as being cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was finally cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', but returned to Kentwood after the show was cancelled. She enrolled at [[Parklane Academy]] in nearby [[McComb, Mississippi]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more."<ref name=rs1/><ref name=rs2>{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It : Rolling Stone|date=2000-05-25|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=2010-06-05|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X}}</ref> In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional [[demo (music)|demo]]. He sent Spears an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears travelled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as [[The Backstreet Boys]] and [[The Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]]." Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}</ref> Senior vice president of [[A&R]] Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that."<ref name=rs1/> They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."<ref name="Hughes 2005 147">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}</ref> After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary" but felt alright with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz PoP]] and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], among others.<ref name=rs1/> ===1998–2000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!...
