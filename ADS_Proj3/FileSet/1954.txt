were stored in a single, unified store. This basic design, denoted the [[von Neumann architecture]], would serve as the foundation for the worldwide development of ENIAC's successors.<ref>{{harvnb|von Neumann|1945|p=1}}. The title page, as submitted by Goldstine, reads: "First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC by John von Neumann, Contract No. W-670-ORD-4926, Between the United States Army Ordnance Department and the University of Pennsylvania Moore School of Electrical Engineering".</ref> In this generation of equipment, temporary or working storage was provided by [[acoustic delay line]]s, which used the propagation time of sound through a medium such as liquid [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (or through a wire) to briefly store data. A series of [[acoustics|acoustic]] pulses is sent along a tube; after a time, as the pulse reached the end of the tube, the circuitry detected whether the pulse represented a 1 or 0 and caused the oscillator to re-send the pulse. Others used [[Williams tube]]s, which use the ability of a small cathode-ray tube (CRT) to store and retrieve data as charged areas on the phosphor screen. By 1954, [[magnetic core memory]]<ref>[[An Wang]] filed October 1949, {{Ref patent |country=US|number=2708722|status=patent|gdate=1955-05-17|title=Pulse transfer controlling devices}}</ref> was rapidly displacing most other forms of temporary storage, and dominated the field through the mid-1970s. [[File:Magnetic core.jpg|left|thumb|250|[[Magnetic core memory]]. Each [[Magnetic core|core]] is one [[bit]].]] EDVAC was the first stored-program computer designed; however it was not the first to run. Eckert and Mauchly left the project and its construction floundered. The first working von Neumann machine was the Manchester "Baby" or [[Small-Scale Experimental Machine]], developed by [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C. Williams]] and [[Tom Kilburn]] at the [[University of Manchester]] in 1948 as a test bed for the [[Williams tube]];<ref>{{harvnb|Enticknap|1998|p=1}}; Baby's 'first good run' was June 21, 1948.</ref> it was followed in 1949 by the [[Manchester Mark 1]] computer, a complete system, using Williams tube and [[magnetic drum]] memory, and introducing [[index register]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Manchester|1998}}, by [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/acknowledge.mark1.html R.B.E. Napper, et al.]</ref> The other contender for the title "first digital stored-program computer" had been [[EDSAC]], designed and constructed at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Operational less than one year after the Manchester "Baby", it was also capable of tackling real problems. EDSAC was actually inspired by plans for EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer), the successor to ENIAC; these plans were already in place by the time ENIAC was successfully operational. Unlike ENIAC, which used parallel processing, EDVAC used a single processing unit. This design was simpler and was the first to be implemented in each succeeding wave of miniaturization, and increased reliability. Some view Manchester Mark 1 / EDSAC / EDVAC as the "Eves" from which nearly all current computers derive their architecture. Manchester University's machine became the prototype for the [[Ferranti Mark 1]]. The first Ferranti Mark 1 machine was delivered to the University in February, 1951 and at least nine others were sold between 1951 and 1957. The first universal programmable computer in the Soviet Union was created by a team of scientists under direction of [[Sergei Alekseyevich Lebedev]] from [[Kiev Institute of Electrotechnology]], [[Soviet Union]] (now [[Ukraine]]). The computer [[History of computer hardware in communist countries#MESM|MESM]] (''МЭСМ'', ''Small Electronic Calculating Machine'') became operational in 1950. It had about 6,000 vacuum tubes and consumed 25 kW of power. It could perform approximately 3,000 operations per second. Another early machine was [[CSIRAC]], an Australian design that ran its first test program in 1949. CSIRAC is the oldest computer still in existence and the first to have been used to play digital music.<ref>{{harvnb|CSIRAC|2005}}</ref> ==Commercial computers== The first commercial computer was the [[Ferranti Mark 1]], which was delivered to the [[University of Manchester]] in February 1951. It was based on the [[Manchester Mark 1]]. The main improvements over the Manchester Mark 1 were in the size of the [[primary storage]] (using [[Random-access memory|random access]] [[Williams tubes]]), [[secondary storage]] (using a [[drum memory|magnetic drum]]), a faster multiplier, and additional instructions. The basic cycle time was 1.2 milliseconds, and a multiplication could be completed in about 2.16 milliseconds. The multiplier used almost a quarter of the machine's 4,050 vacuum tubes (valves).<ref>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|p=25}}</ref> A second machine was purchased by the [[University of Toronto]], before the design was revised into the [[Ferranti Mark 1#Mark 1 Star|Mark 1 Star]]. At least seven of the these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] labs in [[Amsterdam]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Computer Conservation Society | author-link = Computer Conservation Society | title = Our Computer Heritage Pilot Study: Deliveries of Ferranti Mark I and Mark I Star computers. | url = http://www.ourcomputerheritage.org/wp/ | accessdate = 9 January 2010 }}</ref> In October 1947, the directors of [[J. Lyons and Co.|J.

On 17 November 1951, the J. Lyons company began weekly operation of a bakery valuations job on the LEO (Lyons Electronic Office). This was the first business [[:Category:Application software|application]] to go live on a stored program computer.<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|2008|p=24}} notes that David Caminer (1915–2008) served as the first corporate electronic systems analyst, for this first business computer system, a Leo computer, part of J.

LEO would calculate an employee's pay, handle billing, and other office automation tasks.</ref> In June 1951, the [[UNIVAC I]] (Universal Automatic Computer) was delivered to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].
