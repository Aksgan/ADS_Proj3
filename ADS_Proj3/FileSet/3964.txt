[[Ontology (information science)|Ontology]] is usually developed for a specific information domain, which can formally represent the data in its domain. Semantic publishing of more general information like product information, news, and job openings uses so-called [[shallow ontology]].<ref name=ufeed/> The SWEO Linking Open Data Project<ref> [http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData W3C SWEO Linking Open Data Project]</ref> maintains a list of data sources<ref> [http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/DataSets list of data sources]</ref> that follow this approach as well as a list of Semantic Publishing Tools.<ref> [http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/PublishingTools Semantic Publishing Tools]</ref> *Embed formal metadata in documents using new markup languages like [[RDFa]] and [[Microformats]]. ==Examples of ontologies and vocabularies for publishing== *[[Dublin Core]] *[[SKOS]] *[[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] *[[SIOC]] *[[RSS (file format)|RSS]] *[[DOAP]] *[http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLS/ScientificPublishingTaskForce SPE] ==Examples of free or open source tools and services== *[http://ambraproject.org/ Ambra Project] is open source software designed to publish [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journals with [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].

The notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an [[inference engine]], by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The [[inference rules]] are commonly specified by means of an [[ontology language]], and often a [[description language]]. Many reasoners use [[first-order predicate logic]] to perform reasoning; [[inference]] commonly proceeds by [[forward chaining]] and [[backward chaining]]. There are also examples of probabilistic reasoners, including Pei Wang's [[non-axiomatic reasoning system]], Novamente's [[probabilistic logic network]], which tip their hat to reasoning [[Bayesian networks]], and [[Pronto (Java library)|Pronto]] - probabilistic [[description logic]] reasoner. ==Semantic reasoners, etc.== Existing semantic reasoners and related software: ===Non-free software=== * [[Bossam (software)]], an RETE-based rule engine with native supports for reasoning over OWL ontologies, SWRL ontologies, and RuleML rules. * [[DLog]], Resolution based Description Logic ABox reasoner that translates to Prolog ([http://sintagma.szit.bme.hu/dlog DLog]). * [[OWLIM]], a high-performance semantic repository developed in Java and available in two versions: free SwiftOWLIM and commercial BigOWLIM.
