National Core for Neuroethics strives to ''tackle the ethical, legal, policy and social implications of frontier [[neuroscience]] through high impact research, education and outreach to ensure the close alignment of innovation and human values''<ref name="Lau P. 2008">Lau P., Chahal, N.

National Core for Neuroethics Annual Report 2007-2008. 2008, Vancouver, BC.</ref>. == Vision == [[Image:National Core for Neuroethics Plaque.JPG|right|thumb|300px|National Core for Neuroethics]] The Core has a vision ''that neuroscience is applied for maximum knowledge, health and well-being through the early integration of ethics and research, a collective understanding of neuroethics, and the development of policies as the science unfolds''<ref name="Lau P. 2008"/>. To this end, the Core holds six key values that it uses to guide its research, education, and outreach activities: '''[[Integrity]]''': Uphold high moral and ethics principles in all aspects of neuroethics research, education and outreach '''[[Innovation]]''': Pursue creative and novel approaches to long-standing and nascent issues in neuroethics '''[[Leadership]]''': Inspire and motivate high impact neuroethics research, education and outreach '''[[Teamwork]]''': Respect the diversity and individuality of thoughts, ideals and beliefs '''[[Partnership]]''': Actively engage collaborators and stakeholders '''[[Responsiveness]]''': Promote sensitivity to research, education and outreach needs of the external environment == People == The Core is led by '''[[Judy Illes]]''', PhD, Canada Research Chair in Neuroethics and Professor of Neurology at the University of British Columbia<ref name="neuroethics.ubc.ca">http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/people.html</ref>.

The [[U.S. Congress]] established the program in 2000. The Library was chosen because of its mission to "sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations," and also because of its role as one of the leading providers of high-quality content on the Internet. The Library of Congress has formed a national network of partners dedicated to preserving specific types of digital content that is at risk of loss. In July 2010, the Library launched a National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) to extend the work of NDIIPP to more institutions. The new organization will focus on several goals. It will develop improved preservation standards and practices; work with experts to identify categories of digital information that are most worthy of preservation; and take steps to incorporate content into a national collection. It will provide national leadership for digital preservation education and training. The new organization will also provide communication and outreach for all aspects of digital preservation. The NDSA now consists of a core set of founding members drawn from current NDIIPP project partners. Those members will develop a roadmap for immediate action, including a process for expanding membership.<ref>[http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/ www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/]</ref> ==Overview== The [[digital preservation|preservation of digital content]] has become a major challenge for [[library|libraries]] and [[archive]]s whose mission is to preserve the intellectual and cultural heritage of the nation. In 1998 the Library of Congress began to develop a digital strategy with a group of senior managers who were charged with assessing the roles and responsibilities of the Library in the digital age. This oversight group was headed by the Associate Librarian for Strategic Initiatives, the Associate Librarian for Library Services, and the Register of Copyrights. This group held several planning meetings to assess the current state of digital archiving and preservation. The Librarian of Congress [[James H. Billington]] commissioned the National Research Council Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] to evaluate the Library's readiness to meet the challenges of
