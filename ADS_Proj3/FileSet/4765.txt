been one of continuing growth and development. A significant addition during the 1980s was the purchase of the manuscripts, and about 10,000 printed books, from the Medical Society of London Library. The Wellcome Trust's activities around the history of medicine, and on the public understanding of science, were brought together in 1998 to create a new Medicine, Society, and History Division. Recognising a wider remit than history of medicine only, the Library is part of [[Wellcome Collection]] and aims to promote both the history and understanding of medicine. ==Collections== ;History of medicine collection A collection of books, journals and other print materials, and electronic resources, dealing with the history of all aspects of medical science and practice, as well as allied scientific disciplines, social sciences and humanities. Currently comprises over 80,000 volumes in many languages, published from 1850 to the present day. ;Clinical medicine collections Medical and scientific literature reflecting the course of medical thought and practice in different social and cultural settings. Comprises thousands of medical monographs, anatomical atlases, pharmacopoeias, 20,000 items of medical ephemera, a growing number of electronic resources and much more. ;Medicine and society collections An extensive collection of printed and electronic resources on a diverse range of subjects, including popular science, consumer health, biomedical science policy, research ethics, science education and public engagement with science. ;Asian collections Comprises 12,000 manuscripts and 4,000 printed books in 43 different languages. The collection includes over 1000 manuscripts written on palm leaves, and others transcribed on silk, ivory, metal, bone, bamboo and tree bark<ref>Allan, N. (ed.) (1993) ''Pearls of the Orient: Asian treasures of the Wellcome Library''. London: Serindia</ref>. A medical prescription from ancient Egypt, written on papyrus (c.1100 BCE), is the oldest document in the Wellcome Library. ;Archives and manuscripts Includes many European unpublished records dating from antiquity to the 20th century. The manuscripts contain material in 25 different languages. The (mainly) 20th-century archives concentrate on material in English. They include papers of eminent figures in medical science and related areas (such as [[Francis Crick]] and [[Melanie Klein]]) as well as records of numerous and diverse organisations (such as the [[Family Planning Association]] and [[Action on Smoking and Health]]). ;Rare book collection Approximately 60,000 pre-1851 rare books including c. 600 incunabula (books printed before 1501) and c. 5000 books from the 16th century. All aspects of medical science and practice are represented, and there are wide and varied holdings in allied subjects. ;Paintings, prints and drawings collection Over 100,000 prints, drawings, paintings, photographs and other media, ranging from the 14th century to the present day, and geographically from Japan and China in the east through Tibet and India to Turkey, Europe and the Americas, with smaller collections dealing with Africa and Australasia. In accordance with Wellcome's philosophy, the works show the historical and cultural contexts of medicine as well as internal developments in medical techniques and practices. ;Moving image and sound collections Over 4000 films and videos and 1500 audio tapes, both broadcast and non-broadcast, covering the many and varied aspects of medicine: social and clinical areas of science, historical and current topics, physical and psychological aspects of health and surgery.

Adaptations were made by [[Sphere, Inc]] for [[Spectrum Holobyte]], and by [[Infogrames]]. It was originally released for [[DOS]] [[1989 in video gaming|in 1989]]. It was subsequently ported to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] [[1990 in video gaming|in 1990]] and the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] [[1991 in video gaming|in 1991]]. ==Gameplay== ''Welltris'' was the first ''[[Tetris]]'' sequel designed by original designer [[Alexey Pajitnov]], with Andrei Sgenov. It retains that game's falling-block puzzle gameplay but extends the pit into three dimensions while the blocks remain two-dimensional, with the board viewed from above. ==Critical reaction== <!--DOS, Mac, Amiga and Atari ST review scores to go here (being the earlier releases)--> The ZX Spectrum version had luke-warm reviews, with ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' awarding 79%,<ref>CRASH issue 87, April 1991</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' awarded 45%<ref>''Sinclair User'' issue 110</ref> and ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' gave 79%.<ref>''Your Sinclair'' issue 64, April 1991</ref> The actual gameplay and addictiveness were highlighted as good areas, but criticisms included the fiddly controls and minimal sound and looks.
