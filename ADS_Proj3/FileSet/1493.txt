or blood. ====Plastic prints==== A plastic print is a friction ridge impression left in a material that retains the shape of the ridge detail. Although very few criminals would be careless enough to leave their prints in a lump of wet clay, this would make a perfect plastic print.<ref name=lifeoflatents>{{Cite journal | last = Johnson | first = P. Lee | year = 1973 | title = Life of Latents | journal = Identification News | volume = 23 | issue = 1 }}</ref> Commonly encountered examples are melted candle wax, putty removed from the perimeter of window panes and thick grease deposits on car parts. Such prints are already visible and need no enhancement, but investigators must not overlook the potential that invisible latent prints deposited by accomplices may also be on such surfaces. After photographically recording such prints, attempts should be made to develop other non-plastic impressions deposited from sweat or other contaminates. ====Electronic recording==== There has been a newspaper report<ref>''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', Thursday 17 June 2010, front page</ref> of a man selling stolen watches sending images of them on a [[mobile phone]], and those images included parts of his hands in enough detail for police to be able to identify fingerprint patterns. ===Classifying fingerprints=== Before computerisation replaced manual filing systems in large fingerprint operations, manual fingerprint classification systems were used to categorize fingerprints based on general ridge formations (such as the presence or absence of circular patterns on various fingers), thus permitting filing and retrieval of paper records in large collections based on friction ridge patterns alone. The most popular ten-print classification systems include the Roscher system, the [[Juan Vucetich]] system, and the [[Henry Classification System]]. Of these systems, the Roscher system was developed in Germany and implemented in both [[Germany]] and [[Japan]], the Vucetich system (developed by a Croatian-born Buenos Aires Police Officer) was developed in [[Argentina]] and implemented throughout South America, and the Henry system was developed in [[India]] and implemented in most English-speaking countries.<ref name=roscher>{{Cite journal | last = Engert | first = Gerald J. | year = 1964 | title = International Corner | journal = Identification News | volume = 14 | issue = 1 }}</ref> In the Henry system of classification, there are three basic fingerprint patterns: Loop, Whorl and Arch,<ref name=henryclass>{{Cite web | url = http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/henry-classification.pdf | last = Henry | first = Edward R., Sir | year = 1900 | title = Classification and Uses of Finger Prints | location = London | publisher = George Rutledge & Sons, Ltd }}</ref> which constitute 60&ndash;65%, 30&ndash;35% and 5% of all fingerprints respectively.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://odec.ca/projects/2004/fren4j0/public_html/fingerprint_patterns.htm | title = Fingerprint Patterns | publisher = Online Digital Education Connection | accessdate = March 2010 }}</ref> There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches,<ref name=roscher /> and into loops that may be [[Radial loop|radial]] or [[Ulnar loop|ulna]]r, depending on the side of the [[hand]] the tail points towards. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, double loop whorls, peacock's eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.<ref name= roscher /> The system used by most experts, although complex, is similar to the Henry System of Classification. It consists of five fractions, in which ''R'' stands for right, ''L'' for left, ''i'' for index finger, ''m'' for middle finger, ''t'' for thumb, ''r'' for ring finger and ''p''(pinky) for little finger. The fractions are as follows: ''Ri/Rt + Rr/Rm + Lt/Rp + Lm/Li + Lp/Lr.'' The numbers assigned to each print are based on whether or not they are whorls. A whorl in the first fraction is given a 16, the second an 8, the third a 4, the fourth a 2, and 0 to the last fraction. Arches and loops are assingned values of 0. Lastly, the numbers in the numerator and denominator are added up, using the scheme: :''(Ri + Rr + Lt + Lm + Lp)/(Rt + Rm + Rp + Li + Lr)'' and a 1 is added to both top and bottom, to exclude any possibility of division by zero. For example, if the right ring finger and the left index finger have whorls, the fractions would look like this: :0/0 + 8/0 + 0/0 + 0/2 + 0/0 + 1/1, and the calculation: (0 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1)/(0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1) = 9/3 = 3. Using this system reduces the number of prints that the print in question needs to be compared to. For example, the above set of prints would only need to be compared to other sets of fingerprints with a value of 3.<ref>Conklin, Barbara Gardner, Robert Gardner, and Dennis Shortelle.

When recovered at crime scenes or on items of evidence, sole and toe impressions can be used in the same manner as finger and palm prints to effect identifications. Footprint (toe and sole friction ridge skin) evidence has been admitted in courts in the United States since 1934.<ref>''People v. Les'', 267 Michigan 648, 255 NW 407.</ref> The footprints of infants, along with the thumb or index finger prints of mothers, are still commonly recorded in hospitals to assist in verifying the identity of infants. Often, the only identifiable ridge detail that can be seen on a baby's foot is from the large toe or adjacent to the large toe. It is not uncommon for military records of flight personnel to include bare foot inked impressions. Friction ridge skin protected inside flight boots tends to survive the trauma of a plane crash (and accompanying fire) better
