This problem is a new branch in Combinatorial Optimization and network flow problems. Combinatorial algorithms can be provided to solve fuzzy transportation problem to find the fuzzy optimal flow(s). Such methods are capable of handling the decision maker's risk taking. Some application of such standpoint were presented in industries. Liu and Kao pursued this attempt to find better solution for this problem (Network flow problems with fuzzy arc lengths, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part B: Cybernetics, 34 (2004) 765-769). It is interesting to check that which methods in traditional fuzzy optimization problem can be extended to combinatorial optimization problems e.g., transformation that they maintain the nice structure of problem. Then, valuable algorithms can be proposed for fuzzy combinatorial optimization to take the uncertainty of real problems into account. By using fuzzy transportation, it is a reasonable attempt to find special solutions for hazardous material transportation because of the possibility of implementing the optimistic and pessimistic concepts into account.

Its name is an acronym of ''Global Hosted Operating SysTem''. The old [[URL]] ''G.ho.st'' is a [[domain hack]] using the Sao Tome and Principe ''.st'' country extension and more recently Ghost has moved to http://Ghost.cc. As of April 2010 Ghost has closed its service due to competition and lack of funding. ==Overview== The G.ho.st service provides, over the [[Internet]], a working environment that mimics the classic desktop provided by personal computer operating systems. As an internet-based service, users are able to create, save and return to a working environment from different physical computers and [[mobile phone]]s. G.ho.st calls itself a ''virtual computer''. In July 2009 the software entered [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] stage development, and as of now it remains in this stage. The beta launch near Jerusalem was attended by Quartet Representative and former UK prime minister [[Tony Blair]].<ref name="Tech Startup Bridges Mideast Divide">[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/dec2007/gb20071227_091684.htm Tech Startup Bridges Mideast Divide] BusinessWeek, 27 December 2007</ref><ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/mideastconflictitsoftware High-tech Israeli-Palestinian firm defies barriers] AP in Yahoo!

Such services are not considered [[operating systems]] in the traditional sense although they are sometimes referred to as Web Operating Systems. Whilst they can include a [[GUI]] (e.g. a desktop), a (virtual) file system, application management and security, they do not contain a [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] to interface with physical hardware. Therefore, to use the service an operating system is required, supporting at least a [[web browser]] from which the service can be run.
