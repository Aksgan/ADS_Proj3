The use of belief decision matrices for MCDA problem modelling in the ER approach results in the following features: # An assessment of an option can be more reliably and realistically represented by a belief decision matrix than by a conventional decision matrix. # It accepts data of different formats with various types of uncertainties as inputs, such as single numerical values, probability distribution, and subjective judgments with belief degrees. # It allows all available information embedded in different data formats, including qualitative and incomplete data, to be maximally incorporated in assessment and decision making processes. # It allows assessment outcomes to be represented more informatively.

Banathy]], his son [[Béla A. Bánáthy]], and [[Stanley Krippner]], a distinguished scholar in the field of consciousness research and a leader in the [[transpersonal psychology]] movement. Evolutionary guidance media is defined as "media designed both in content and context specifically for the purpose of guiding and/or facilitating the societal emergence of transpersonal consciousness – specifically planetary consciousness" (Klisanin, 2005). Planetary consciousness is “the knowing as well as the feeling of the vital interdependence and essential oneness of humankind, and the conscious adoption of the ethics and the ethos that this entails” ([[Ervin Laszlo]], 1997, p. 143). The evolutionary guidance media framework was designed using a generic blueprint for the creation of evolutionary guidance systems as described by [[Bela H. Banathy]] (1996, 2000). Evolutionary guidance systems are systems designed such that human beings can take responsibility and control for their own evolutionary processes. Banathy suggested that such systems might include input from the following interactive dimensions: social action, economic, wellness, moral, design (learning and human development), aesthetic, scientific, technological, and political. These areas are not value neutral but rather value-laden (geared toward promoting a more just and equitable quality of life for all beings). These dimensions are an integral facet of evolutionary guidance media such that data from these nine dimensions are required in creating both the context (structure of the media company) and content (the creative product/media). == Fundaments == Fundamental to the design of evolutionary guidance media is the concept of ''transception,'' a term coined by Klisanin (2005) that posits the pairing of compassionate-seeing/action with that of cyberception, or humankind’s rapidly advancing technological abilities. The core [[values]] of evolutionary guidance media include "the promotion of values that support [[conscious evolution]], planetary consciousness, transpersonal experiences, and superconscious learning. These include but are not limited to being-values, compassion, love, personal and social responsibility, creative altruism, peace and conflict resolution skills, gender and racial diversity" (Klisanin, 2005). Drawing heavily upon research in systems science, specifically evolutionary guidance systems as well as integral, humanistic, and transpersonal psychology, evolutionary guidance media was developed because of the perceived need for a method of rapidly advancing human consciousness due to the problematic conditions (environmental and social) confronting the global society. == References
