The character was created in the 1980s by the [[Canadian]] [[amputee]] organization [[The War Amps]] and is featured in material for their ''PLAYSAFE'' program to educate children about safety. The original televised segment featured a performer in an elaborate costume as ASTAR performing acrobatic stunts in a world full of dangerous machines. After evading various threats such as electrical hazards and moving blades, ASTAR eventually makes a mistake causing his arm to be amputated by a large rotating saw. He then picks up his severed arm and reattaches it with ease. The segment ends with ASTAR giving the warning: :I am ASTAR, a robot. I can put my arm back on. You can't. So play safe!</blockquote> The above warning is now part of Canadian [[popular culture]] for those who grew up in the 1980s. In a recent remake of the segment, ASTAR is now an animated [[CG]] character, and the warning is altered slightly to "I am ASTAR, a robot '''from Planet Danger'''. I can put my arm back on. You can't.

In 2006, the company was acquired by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) and was renamed to the AMD Graphics Products group. Despite the acquisition, the ATI brand was retained for graphics cards until August 30, 2010. AMD have announced that it will retire the "ATI" name and instead brand its graphics chipsets as "AMD" beginning in late 2010.<ref>http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/358774/ati_re-branded_amd/</ref> ATi Technologies is a [[fabless semiconductor company]] conducting in-house [[research and development]] and [[outsourcing]] the [[manufacturing]] and assembly of its products. Its main competitor is [[NVIDIA]] in the graphics and handheld market. The flagship product, the [[Radeon]] series of graphics cards, directly competes with [[NVIDIA]]'s [[GeForce]]. These two companies' dominance of the market forced other manufacturers into niche roles. ==History== Lee Ka Lau<ref>[http://www.giving.utoronto.ca/chairs/showchairs.asp?ID=19 University of Toronto Division of University Advancement page]. Retrieved February 28, 2008.</ref>, Benny Lau and Kwok Yuen Ho<ref>[http://www.ati.com/designpartners/media/bios/kyho.html K.Y. Ho biography on ATI website]</ref> founded ATI in 1985 as "Array Technologies Incorporated". Working primarily in the [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as [[IBM]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder graphics card product lines under its brand that year<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Weblets/0,,7832_10554,00.html?redir=AAMD04#1980 History of AMD at AMD.com]</ref>. In May 1991, the company released the Mach8, ATI's first product able to process graphics without the CPU. Debuting in 1992, the Mach32 offered improved memory bandwidth and [[graphical user interface|GUI]] acceleration performance. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993 with stock listed at [[NASDAQ]] and [[Toronto Stock Exchange]]. [[File:AMDmarkham4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|AMD Markham at the former ATI headquarters.]] [[File:Atitechnologiessiliconvalley.jpg|thumb|right|250px|ATI's former Silicon Valley office.]] [[File:ATI Wonder.jpg|thumb|ATI VGA Wonder with 256 kB RAM.]] In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for [[YUV]]-to-[[RGB]] [[color space]] conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration. ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] accelerator under the name [[ATI Rage|3D Rage]]. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the [[ATI Rage|Rage Pro]] was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to [[3Dfx]]'s 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced [[DirectX|DirectX 6.0]] accelerator in the 1999 [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]]. The [[All-in-Wonder]] product line introduced in 1996 was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with [[TV tuner card]] and the first chip that enabled to display computer graphics on a TV set<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Weblets/0,,7832_10554,00.html?redir=AAMD04#1990 History of AMD - 1996 at AMD.com]</ref>. The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's second generation 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analog video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception. ATI made an entrance into the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to [[laptop]]s in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from desktop PC, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, [[Transition Minimized Differential Signaling|TMDS]] output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired [[Tseng Labs]]'s graphics assets, which included 40 [[engineer]]s. The [[Radeon]] line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon [[graphics processing unit]] was an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions. In 2000, ATI acquired [[ArtX]], which engineered the [[Nintendo GameCube#Graphics Processing Unit and System Chipset|Flipper]] graphics chip used in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] game console. They have also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed [[Hollywood (graphics chip)|Hollywood]]) for the successor of the [[GameCube]], the [[Wii]]. ATI was contracted by [[Microsoft]] to create the graphics core (codenamed [[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos]]) for the [[Xbox 360]]. Later in 2005, ATI acquired [[Terayon's]] cable modem [[silicon intellectual property]] strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market<ref>[http://apps.ati.com/ir/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=105421&releaseID=671557 press release]</ref>.
