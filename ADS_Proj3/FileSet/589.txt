Diploma. ==History== The introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a [[University of Cambridge]] Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the "demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing … <nowiki>[which]</nowiki> if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered". The [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] "was one of the pioneers in the development and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)". It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that "The Summer School deals <nowiki>[only]</nowiki> with 'programming', rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed." The Diploma "would include theoretical and practical work … <nowiki>[and also]</nowiki> instruction about the various types of computing-machine … and the principles of design on which they are based." With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.<ref>[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/UoCCL/misc/EDSAC99/history.html Informal history of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]</ref> University-supported teaching and research staff in the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Laboratory]] at the time were [[Maurice Wilkes]] (head of the laboratory), [[J. C. P. Miller]], W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove. In its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year ("Part IB") of the undergraduate [[Computer Science Tripos]] course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate ("Part II") lecture courses also included. There were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail. Starting from 2009, Computer Lab is now offering a postgraduate degree in Advanced Computer Science, as a replacement to the Diploma course. ==Notable alumni== * [[Samson Abramsky]] * [[Ian Bell (programmer)|Ian Bell]] * [[Stephen R.

Retrieved October 26, 2007</ref> was created by two [[Columbia University]] sophomores, Adam Goldberg (who was student body president of the university's [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)]]) and Wayne Ting (who was the class president of its liberal arts school, [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]]). The site launched as SEASCommunity in August, 2003.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2004-11-23-campus-connection-usat_x.htm] Bourne, Claire, "Web sites click on campus." USA Today, November 23, 2004. Retrieved March 14, 2010</ref> The site offered its original users a unique forum to exchange ideas, to showcase artistic expression, and to connect with other students. It eventually expanded to the entire university, and was renamed CUCommunity, and quickly became an important source of social-interaction for its members eventually connecting over 75% of the Columbia undergraduate population. It became the place for the campus community which allowed greater individual control, communities compromise social arrangements where individuals learn by participating. SEAS was arranged for students to interact and participate together. All of online communities lack physical presence which influences and changes norm behavior. <ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W4X-44BMD1R-4&_user=2665692&_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2001&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1619182803&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000058486&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=2665692&md5=2bc889345ad57d63bdf56ff8214586f3&searchtype=a</ref> In Fall 2004, facing growing pressure from Facebook at Columbia, but sensing its superior product might still win out if it were able to expand as rapidly, CUCommunity relaunched as a national social working site, CampusNetwork. ==Site Features== Users could create personal homepages (eg. user.school.campusnetwork.com), post [[blog|journals]] and photos. While it never took off as well as its main competitor, Facebook, as of 2005, it had the second largest number of registered users among college networking sites. CampusNetwork allowed users to create publicly accessible homepages. Today Facebook is a social leading network site similar as SEAS it allows people to share ideas and is driven by a small group. This is one of the popular sites, the one with the most visitors every day, it has heavy usage among the young adults about 65% between ages 19-21 visit the site daily. <ref>http://rubiconconsulting.com/downloads/whitepapers/Rubicon-web-community.pdf</ref> Undergraduate students suggest a strong association between use of Facebook with strongest relationships. It provides greater benefits for users experiencing low self-esteem. The site can be related towards work context, romantic relationship, and connecting with those with shared ideas. It serves a big community (the campus), it is a tool for individuals who have difficulties maintaining a strong relationship. Young adults leaving to college leave friends behind and need to create new networks at college, they tend to add to Facebook since it does not exclude particular groups instead it accumulates which identifies why people adapted to Facebook leaving behind SEAS.<ref>http://museweb01-pub.library.uq.edu.au/journals/review_of_higher_education/v031/31.1wolniak.pdf</ref> SEAS was created as a place to centralize events for members of the class 2006, users could upload favorite photos and discuss issues. It was relaunched in 2004 as CUCommunity and later relaunched again as a social network site called CampusNetwork in fall 2004 but it failed again to gain attraction. <ref> http://community.seas.columbia.edu/cslp/reports/fall03/CSLPScheduling.pdf </ref> ==Site Termination== With a peak of 240,000 users, the site was closed in February 2006. There is much speculation as to why the site was shut down; however, none of it conclusive. ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/12/13/BUG65A8Q1I1.DTL] Kopytoff, Verne, "Log on, link up.
