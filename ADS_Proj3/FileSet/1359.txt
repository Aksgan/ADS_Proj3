Those who believe this view say that humans are strictly defined by [[stimulus-response]] ([[social environment|environment]]-[[behavior]]) and cannot deviate. The fundamental argument of the environmental determinists was that aspects of physical geography, particularly climate, influenced the psychological mind-set of individuals, which in turn defined the behaviour and culture of the society that those individuals formed. For example, tropical climates were said to cause laziness, relaxed attitudes and promiscuity, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle latitudes led to more determined and driven [[work ethic]]s. Because these environmental influences operate slowly on human biology, it was important to trace the migrations of groups to see what environmental conditions they had evolved under. Key proponents of this notion have included [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], [[Ellsworth Huntington]], [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] and possibly [[Jared Diamond]]. Although Diamond's work does make connections between environmental and climatic conditions and societal development, it is published with the stated intention of disproving racist and eurocentric theories of development. <ref>{{Citation |last=Andrew |first=Sluyter |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Neo-Environmental Determinism, Intellectual Damage Control, and Nature/Society Science |journal=Antipode |volume=4 |issue=35 |pages=813–817 |date=2003 |url=http://www.antipode-online.net/abstract.asp?vid=35&iid=4&aid=12&s=0 |doi= |id= |accessdate= |postscript=.}}</ref> ==History== {{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}} Environmental determinism's origins go back to antiquity, where it is first encountered in a fifth-century medical treatise ascribed to [[Hippocrates]]: ''Airs, Waters, Places'' <ref>Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. 2004</ref>. In Roman times it is, for example, found in the work of the Greek geographer [[Strabo]] who wrote that climate influences the psychological disposition of different races. Some in ancient China advanced a form of environmental determinism as found in the ''Works of Guan Zhong'' ([[Guanzi]] 管子), perhaps written in the 2nd century BCE. In the chapter "Water and Earth" (''Shuidi'' 水地), we find statements like "Now the water of [the state of] Qi is forceful, swift and twisting. Therefore its people are greedy, uncouth, and warlike," and "The water of Chu is gentle, yielding, and pure. Therefore its people are lighthearted, resolute, and sure of themselves." <ref>trans. Allyn Rickett (1998), in ''Guanzi: Political, Economic, and Philosophical Essays from Early China: A Study and Translation''. Volume II. Princeton University Press, p. 106.</ref> Another early adherent of environmental determinism was the medieval [[Afro-Arab]] writer [[al-Jahiz]], who explained how the environment can determine the physical characteristics of the inhabitants of a certain community. He used his early theory of [[evolution]] to explain the origins of different [[human skin color]]s, particularly [[Black people|black skin]], which he believed to be the result of the environment. He cited a stony region of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] as evidence for his theory:<ref>Lawrence I. Conrad (1982), "Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'' '''25''' (3), pp. 268-307 [278].</ref> {{quote|"[It] is so unusual that its gazelles and ostriches, its insects and flies, its foxes, sheep and asses, its horses and its birds are all black. Blackness and whiteness are in fact caused by the properties of the region, as well as by the God-given nature of water and soil and by the proximity or remoteness of the sun and the intensity or mildness of its heat."}} The [[Sociology in medieval Islam|Arab sociologist]] and [[polymath]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], was also an adherent of environmental determinism. In his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), he explained that black skin was due to the hot climate of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and not due to their lineage. He thus dispelled the [[Hamitic]] theory, where the sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] were cursed by being black, as a myth.<ref>{{citation|title='Race', slavery and Islam in Maghribi Mediterranean thought: the question of the Haratin in Morocco|first=Chouki|last=El Hamel|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=7|issue=3|year=2002|pages=29–52 [39–42]}}</ref> Many translations of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to fit the colonial propaganda machine.<ref>http://www.jstor.org/pss/3590803 Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum © 2003 Wesleyan University.</ref> [http://books.google.com/books?id=6swTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61 ''The Negro Land of the Arabs Examined and Explained''] was written in 1841 and gives excerpts of older translations that were not part of colonial propaganda.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=6swTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61 The Negro Land of the Arabs Examined and Explained: "''When the conquest of the West (by the Arabs) was completed, and merchants began to penetrate into the interior, they saw no nation of the Blacks so mighty as Ghanah, the dominions of which extended
