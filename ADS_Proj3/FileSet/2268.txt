For example, as can be seen in the table above, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium (stripping the two 3s electrons from a magnesium atom) are much smaller than the third, which requires stripping off a 2p electron from the very stable [[neon]] configuration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. [[Image:IonizationEnergyAtomicWeight.PNG|thumb|300px|Periodic trend for ionization energy. Each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the noble gases.]] Ionization energy is also a periodic trend within the [[periodic table]] organization. Moving left to right within a [[Period (periodic table)|period]] or upward within a [[Group (periodic table)|group]], the ionization energy generally increases. As the [[atomic radius]] decreases, it becomes harder to remove an electron that is closer to a more positively charged nucleus. == Electrostatic explanation == Atomic ionization energy can be predicted by an analysis using [[electrostatic potential]] and the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, as follows. Consider an electron of charge ''-[[elementary charge|e]]'' and an atomic nucleus with charge ''+Ze'', where ''Z'' is the number of protons in the nucleus. According to the [[Bohr model]], if the electron were to approach and bind with the atom, it would come to rest at a certain radius ''a''. The electrostatic potential ''V'' at distance ''a'' from the ionic nucleus, referenced to a point infinitely far away, is: <math>V = \frac{Ze}{a} \,\!</math> Since the electron is negatively charged, it is drawn inwards by this positive electrostatic potential. The energy required for the electron to "climb out" and leave the atom is: <math>E = eV = \frac{Ze^2}{a} \,\!</math> This analysis is incomplete, as it leaves the distance ''a'' as an unknown variable. It can be made more rigorous by assigning to each electron of every [[chemical element]] a characteristic distance, chosen so that this relation agrees with experimental data. It is possible to expand this model considerably by taking a semi-classical approach, in which momentum is quantized. This approach works very well for the hydrogen atom, which only has one electron. The magnitude of the angular momentum for a circular orbit is: <math> L = |\mathbf r \times \mathbf p| = rmv = n\hbar</math> The total energy of the atom is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, that is: <math> E = T + U = \frac{p^2}{2m_e} - \frac{Ze^2}{r} = \frac{m_e v^2}{2} - \frac{Ze^2}{r}</math> Velocity can be eliminated from the kinetic energy term by setting the Coulomb attraction equal to the centripetal force, giving: <math> T = \frac{Ze^2}{2r}</math> Solving the angular momentum for ''v'' and substituting this into the expression for kinetic energy, we have: <math>\frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{rm_e} = Ze^2</math> This establishes the dependence of the radius on ''n''. That is: <math>r(n) = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{Zm_e e^2}</math> Now the energy can be found in terms of ''Z'', ''e'', and ''r''. Using the new value for the kinetic energy in the total energy equation above, it is found that: <math>E = - \frac{Ze^2}{2r}</math> At its smallest value, ''n'' is equal to 1 and ''r'' is the [[Bohr radius]] ''a<sub>0</sub>''. Now, the equation for the energy can be established in terms of the Bohr radius. Doing so gives the result: <math> E = - \frac{1}{n^2} \frac{Z^2e^2}{2a_0} = - \frac{Z^213.6eV}{n^2}</math> == Quantum-mechanical explanation == According to the more complete theory of [[quantum mechanics]], the location of an electron is best described as a probability distribution. The energy can be calculated by integrating over this cloud. The cloud's underlying mathematical representation is the [[wavefunction]] which is built from [[Slater determinant]]s consisting of molecular spin orbitals. These are related by [[Pauli's exclusion principle]] to the antisymmetrized products of the [[atomic orbital|atomic]] or [[molecular orbitals]]. In general, calculating the ''n''th ionization energy requires calculating the energies of <math>Z-n+1</math> and <math>Z-n</math> electron systems. Calculating these energies exactly is not possible except for the simplest systems (i.e. hydrogen), primarily because of difficulties in integrating the correlation terms. Therefore, approximation methods are rountinely employed, with different methods varying in complexity (computational time) and in accuracy compared to empirical data. This has become a well-studied problem and is routinely done in [[computational chemistry]]. At the lowest level of approximation, the ionization energy is provided by [[Koopmans' theorem]]. == Vertical ionization energy and adiabatic ionization energy == The geometry of a molecular ion may be different from the neutral molecule. The measured ionization energy can refer to the vertical ionization energy, in which case the ion has the same geometry as the neutral molecule, or to the [[adiabatic ionization]] energy, in which case the ion has its lowest energy, relaxed geometry. This is illustrated in the figure. For a diatomic molecule the only geometry change possible is the bond length. The figure shows an ion with a slightly longer bond length than the neutral molecule. The harmonic potential energy surfaces are shown in green (neutral) and red (ion) with vibrational energy levels. The vertical ionization energy is always greater than the adiabatic ionization energy.<ref>http://cccbdb.nist.gov/adiabatic.asp</ref> ==See also== *[[Bragg-Gray Cavity Theory]] * [[Electronegativity]] * [[Ionization]] * The ''[[work function]]'' is the energy required to strip
