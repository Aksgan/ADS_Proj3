Essbase, whose name derives from "'''E'''xtended '''S'''pread '''S'''heet data'''BASE'''", began as a product of Arbor Software, which merged with Hyperion Software in 1998. [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired [[Hyperion Solutions|Hyperion Solutions Corporation]] in 2007, {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} it markets Essbase as "Oracle Essbase". Until late 2005 [[IBM]] also marketed the product — as '''[[IBM DB2|DB2]] OLAP Server'''.<ref>http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/db2olap/ </ref> The database researcher [[E. F. Codd]] coined the term "on-line analytical processing" ([[OLAP]]) in a whitepaper<ref> {{cite journal | last = Codd | first = E. F. | authorlink = Edgar F. Codd | coauthors = S B Codd; C T Salley | date = 1993-07-26 | year = | month = | day = | title = Providing OLAP to User-Analysts: An IT Mandate | journal = [[Computerworld]] | volume = | issue = | series = | pages = | publisher = | location = | issn = | pmid = | pmc = | doi = | bibcode = | oclc = | id = | url = | accessdate = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }} </ref> that set out twelve rules for analytic systems (an allusion to his earlier famous set of [[Codd's 12 rules|twelve rules]] defining the [[relational model]]). This whitepaper, published by [[Computerworld]], was somewhat explicit in its reference to Essbase features, and when it was later discovered that Codd had been sponsored by Arbor Software, Computerworld withdrew the paper.<ref> http://www.regdeveloper.com/2007/01/26/olap_speed/ </ref> In contrast to "on-line transaction processing" ([[OLTP]]), OLAP defines a database technology optimized for processing human queries rather than transactions. The results of this orientation was that [[Multidimensional database|MDBMS]] oriented their performance requirements around a different set of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] ([[Analytic Performance Benchmark]], APB-1) than that of RDBMS ([[Transaction Processing Performance Council]] (TPC)). Hyperion renamed many of its products in 2005, giving Essbase an official name of '''Hyperion System 9 BI+ Analytic Services''', but the new name was largely ignored by practitioners. The Essbase brand was later returned to the official product name for marketing purposes, but the server software still carried the "Analytic Services" title until it was incorporated into Oracle's [[Business Intelligence]] product suite. [http://www.oracle.com/appserver/business-intelligence/essbase.html] In August 2005, ''[[Information Age]]'' magazine named Essbase as one of the 10 most influential technology innovations of the previous 10 years,<ref> http://web.archive.org/web/20070927190115/http://www.hyperion.com/company/news/news_releases/press_release_2005_000512.cfm </ref> along with [[Netscape]], the [[BlackBerry]], [[Google]], [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]], Voice Over IP ([[VOIP]]), [[Linux]], [[XML]], the [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processor and [[ADSL]]. Editor Kenny MacIver said: "Hyperion Essbase was the multi-dimensional database technology that put online analytical processing on the business intelligence map. It has spurred the creation of scores of rival OLAP products – and billions of OLAP cubes". ==History and motivation== Although Essbase has been categorised{{By whom|date=September 2009}} as a general-purpose [[multidimensional database]], it was originally developed to address the [[scalability]] issues associated with [[spreadsheets]] such as [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and [[Microsoft Excel]]. Indeed, the patent covering Essbase uses spreadsheets as a motivating example to illustrate the need for such a system.<ref name="patent">Earle, Robert J. (1992) [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&r=1&l=50&f=G&d=PALL&s1=5359724.PN.&OS=PN/5359724&RS=PN/5359724 "Method and apparatus for storing and retrieving multi-dimensional data in computer memory"]. United States Patent 5,359,724 assigned to [[Arbor Software Corporation]].</ref> In this context, "multi-dimensional" refers to the representation of financial data in spreadsheet format. A typical spreadsheet may display time intervals along column headings, and account names on row headings. For example: {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" ! !! Jan !! Feb !! Mar !! Total |- ! Quantity | 1000 || 2000 || 3000 || '''6000''' |- ! Sales | $100 || $200 || $300 || '''$600''' |- ! Expenses | $80 || $160 || $240 || '''$480''' |- ! Profit | $20 || $40 || $60 || '''$120''' |} If a user wants to break down these values by region, for example, this typically involves the duplication of this table on multiple spreadsheets: {| | {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |+North ! !! Jan !! Feb !! Mar !! Total |- ! Quantity | 240 || 1890 || 50 || '''2180''' |- ! Sales | $24|| $189 || $5 || '''$218''' |- ! Expenses | $20 || $150 || $3 || '''$173''' |- ! Profit | $4 || $39 ||
