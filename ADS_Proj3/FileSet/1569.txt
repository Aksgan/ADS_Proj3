The organization developed the [[GNU]] operating system as an example of this. ; GNU licenses: The [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) is a widely used license for free software projects. The current version (version 3) was released in June 2007. The FSF has also published the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), and the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (AGPL). ; GNU Press: The FSF's publishing department, responsible for "publishing affordable books on computer science using freely distributable licenses."<ref>[http://shop.fsf.org/category/books/ List of books published] in GNU Press home site</ref> ; The [[Free Software Directory]] : This is a listing of software packages which have been verified as free software. Each package entry contains 47 pieces of information such as the project's homepage, developers, programming language, etc. The goals are to provide a search engine for free software, and to provide a cross-reference for users to check if a package has been verified as being free software. FSF has received a small amount of funding from [[UNESCO]] for this project. It is hoped that the directory can be translated into many languages in the future{{By whom|date=May 2010}}. ; Maintaining the [[Free Software Definition]] : FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement. ; Project hosting: FSF hosts software development projects on their [[GNU Savannah|Savannah]] website. ; [[Political campaign]]s : FSF sponsors a number of campaigns against what it perceives as dangers to software freedom, including [[software patent]]s, [[digital rights management]] (which the FSF has re-termed "digital restrictions management", as part of their effort to highlight their view that such technologies are "designed to take away and limit your rights,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/drm.html |title=Digital Restrictions Management and Treacherous Computing |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-12-17 |publisher=Free Software Foundation }}</ref>) and user interface copyright.
