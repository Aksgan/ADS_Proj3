gated, multiple electron beams. Additionally, the Computron was based on the ability of a [[secondary electron emission]] target, under electron bombardment, to assume the potential of the nearest collector electrode. The [[Additron Tube]] design by [[Josef Kates]] gated electron beams of a fixed trajectory with several control grids which either passed or blocked a current. The Computron was a complex cathode ray tube while the Additron was a [[triode]] with multiple grids and targets. A subsection of the Computron was prototyped and tested and the concept validated but the building of an entire device was never attempted. A United States Patent was filed 30 July 1943 and granted 22 July 1947 for the Computron. == Modern implications == The Computron design was an early attempt to produce not only a vacuum tube [[integrated circuit]] for both size and reliability (lifetime) issues, but to minimize external electrical connections between active elements. The goal of integration is not merely to reduce external signal connections into and out of a package by including multiple active devices in one package, as in the [[Loewe 3NF]] tube. It is to merge the functions of the active devices for a technical synergy. A modern example would be the multiple-emitter transistor of [[Transistor–transistor logic]] integrated circuits Another modern construct anticipated by the Computron is the [[barrel shifter]] circuit which is used in many numeric computation style microprocessors. == Damning praise == The Computron was an idea born of the necessity of war research. It was to be a key element of the electronic digital computer which had yet to be built. But the project was begun to increase the accuracy of artillery in battle, not to advance the state of the embryonic electronic computer. Its fate was well described in a letter to Dr. [[Paul E. Klopsteg]], Head of NDRC Division 17, dated 6 February 1943 which concludes: <blockquote> ...As I said above, our entire Division is exceedingly reluctant to see a development which is scientifically so beautiful and so promising dropped at this point, though cold reason tells us that we cannot justify the expenditure of additional Government funds on the basis of Fire Control at this time.<br /> <br /> Sincerely yours, <br /> Harold L. Hazen <br /> Chief, Division 7 </blockquote> ==Patents== *{{US patent|2424289}} ==References== <references/> [[Category:Early computers]] [[Category:Digital electronics]] [[Category:Computer arithmetic]] [[Category:Vacuum tubes]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>7623</id> <title>ConTeXt</title> <text>{{Distinguish|ConTEXT}} {{Infobox software | name = ConTeXt | logo = [[Image:ConTeXt Unofficial Logo.svg|The Unofficial ConTeXt logo (contextgarden.net logo)|200px]] | author = Mainly Hans Hagen and [http://www.pragma-ade.com/ Pragma ADE] | developer = Mainly Hans Hagen, [[Taco Hoekwater]]<ref>[http://www.tug.org/interviews/hoekwater.html Dave Walden interview with Taco Hoekwater.

It is especially suited for structured documents, automated document production, very fine typography, and multi-lingual typesetting. It is based in part on the [[TeX]] [[typesetting]] system, and uses a [[document markup language]] for manuscript preparation. The typographical and automated capabilities of ConTeXt are extensive, including interfaces for handling [[microtypography]], multiple footnotes and footnote classes, and manipulating [[OpenType]] fonts and features. Moreover, it offers extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations, figure-text integration, and conditional compilation. It gives the user extensive control over formatting while making it easy to create new layouts and styles without learning the low-level TeX macro language. ConTeXt may be compared and contrasted with [[LaTeX]], but the primary thrust of the two are rather distinct. ConTeXt from the ground up is a typography and typesetting system meant to provide users easy and consistent access to advanced typographical control—important for general-purpose typesetting tasks. The original vision of LaTeX is to insulate the user from typographical decisions—a useful approach for submitting, say, articles for a scientific journal. LaTeX has evolved from that original vision; at the same time, ConTeXt’s unified design avoids the package clashes that can happen with LaTeX<ref>[http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=context FAQ of the UK TeX Archive]</ref><ref name="whatiscontextwiki">[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/What_is_ConTeXt "What is ConTeXt" page at contextgarden]</ref>. ConTeXt provides a multi-lingual user interface with support for markup in English, Dutch, German, French, and Italian and support for output in many languages including western European, eastern European, Arabic-script, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. It also allows the user to use different TeX engines like [[pdfTeX]], [[XeTeX]], and [[LuaTeX]] without changing the user interface<ref name="whatiscontextwiki"/>. As its native drawing engine, ConTeXt integrates a superset of [[MetaPost]] called [[MetaFun]]<ref name="whatiscontextwiki"/> which allows the users to use the drawing abilities of MetaPost for page backgrounds and ornaments. Metafun can also be used with stand alone MetaPost. ConTeXt also supports the use of other external drawing engines, like [[PGF/TikZ]]<ref>[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/base/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf PGF/TikZ official manual. Version 2.0]. Section 9.1.3 "Using the ConTeXt Format". p. 88</ref> and PSTricks<ref name="list-modules">[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Modules List of ConTeXt modules at contextgarden]</ref>. ConTeXt also provides a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] package for typesetting [[chemical structure]] diagrams with [[TeX]] called [http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/ppchtex.html PPCHTeX]<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Chemistry PPCHTeX Module for ConTeXt reference page at contextgarden]</ref>, as well as many other modules<ref name="list-modules"/><ref>[http://modules.contextgarden.net/ List of ConTeXt modules (static page)]</ref><ref>[http://dl.contextgarden.net/modules/ List of ConTeXt modules in web server for downloading]</ref>. This package can also be used with plain TeX and LaTeX. ConTeXt was developed from 1990{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} by Hans Hagen from [http://www.pragma-ade.com/ PRAGMA Advanced Document Engineering] (Pragma ADE), a Netherlands-based company. == License == ConTeXt is [[free software]]: the program code (i.e. anything not under the <code>/doc</code> subtree) is distributed under the [[GNU GPL]]; the documentation is provided under [[Creative Commons]] Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike license.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Read_Me | title = Read Me | accessdate = 2010-07-13 | last = Hagen | first = Hans
