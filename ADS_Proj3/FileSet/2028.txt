The software provides basic email collaboration features such as create, reply, forward and delete (including attachment support). It also provides meeting request support, including accepting and rejecting meeting invitations with comments as well as attachment handling. The software can be downloaded free of charge by eligible Lotus Notes customers. Lotus Notes Traveler software leverages a secure socket layer (SSL) connection for encrypting data that travels over the air data via an HTTPS protocol. ==See also== *[[IBM Lotus Notes]] *[[IBM Lotus Domino]] *[[IBM Lotus iNotes]] ==External links== *[http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/notesanddomino Lotus Notes and Domino home page] *[http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/notes/traveler.html Lotus Notes Traveler home page] *[http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/xpViewCategories.xsp?lookupName=Lotus%20Notes%20Traveler%208.5.2%20Documentation Lotus Notes Traveler 8.5.2 Documentation] *[http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/archive?openview&title=Lotus%20Notes%20Traveler&type=cat&cat=Lotus%20Notes%20Traveler&sort=I Lotus Notes Traveler Wiki] *[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/domhelp/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.help.lnt85.doc/LNT_overview.html Lotus Notes Traveler 8.5 InfoCenter] *[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/notes85-traveler/IBM Lotus Notes Traveler 8.5 Performance] *[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/29230.wss Press Article: IBM Delivers Enterprise Secure Mail for Android, iPhone, Nokia Symbian Smartphones] {{IBM}} {{Lotus Software}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ibm Lotus Notes Traveler}} [[Category:Lotus software|Traveler]] [[Category:Personal digital assistants]] [[Category:Smartphones]] [[Category:Information appliances]] [[Category:2008 introductions]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17349</id> <title>IBM Rational Unified Process</title> <text>{{Software development process}} The '''Rational Unified Process''' ('''RUP''') is an [[iterative]] [[software development process]] framework created by the [[Rational Software]] Corporation, a division of [[IBM]] since 2003.<ref>http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/IBM-Acquires-Rational/</ref> RUP is not a single concrete prescriptive process, but rather an adaptable process [[Software framework|framework]], intended to be tailored by the development organizations and software project teams that will select the elements of the process that are appropriate for their needs. == History == The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software process product, originally developed by Rational Software, which was acquired by IBM in February 2003. The product includes a hyperlinked knowledge base with sample [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] and detailed descriptions for many different types of activities. RUP is included in the [[IBM Rational Method Composer]] (RMC) product which allows customization of the process. By 1997, Rational had acquired Verdix, Objectory, Requisite, SQA, Performance Awareness, and Pure-Atria. Combining the experience base of these companies led to the articulation of six ''best practices'' for modern software engineering: # Develop iteratively, with risk as the primary iteration driver # Manage requirements # Employ a component-based architecture # Model software visually # Continuously verify quality # Control changes These best practices both drove the development of Rational's products, and were used by Rational's field teams to help customers improve the quality and predictability of their software development efforts. To make this knowledge more accessible, [[Philippe Kruchten]], a Rational techrep, was tasked with the assembly of an explicit process framework for modern software engineering. This effort employed the [[HTML]]-based process delivery mechanism developed by Objectory. The resulting "Rational Unified Process" (RUP) completed a strategic tripod for Rational: * a ''tailorable process'' that guided development * ''tools'' that automated the application of that process * ''services'' that accelerated adoption of both the process and the tools. == Rational Unified Process topics == === RUP building blocks === RUP is based on a set of building blocks, or content elements, describing what is to be produced, the necessary skills required and the step-by-step explanation describing how specific development goals are to be achieved. The main building blocks, or content elements, are the following: * Roles (who) – A Role defines a set of related skills, competencies and responsibilities. * Work Products (what) – A Work Product represents something resulting from a task, including all the documents and models produced while working through the process. * Tasks (how) – A Task describes a unit of work assigned to a Role that provides a meaningful result. Within each iteration, the tasks are categorized into nine disciplines: six "engineering disciplines" (Business Modeling, Requirements, Analysis and Design, Implementation, Test, Deployment) and three supporting disciplines (Configuration and Change Management, Project Management, Environment). === Four Project Life cycle Phases === [[Image:Development-iterative.gif|thumb|320px|RUP phases and disciplines.]] The RUP has determined a project life cycle consisting of four phases. These phases allow the process to be presented at a high level in a similar way to how a 'waterfall'-styled project might be presented, although in essence the key to the process lies in the iterations of development that lie within all of the phases. Also, each phase has one key objective and milestone at the end that denotes the objective being accomplished. The visualization of RUP phases and disciplines over time is referred to as the [[RUP hump]] chart. ==== Inception Phase ==== The primary objective is to scope the system adequately as a basis for validating initial costing and budgets. In this phase the business case which includes business context, success factors (expected revenue, market recognition, etc.), and financial forecast is established. To complement the business case, a basic use case model, project plan, initial risk assessment and project description (the core project requirements, constraints and key features) are generated. After these are completed, the project is checked against the following criteria: * [[Stakeholder (law)|Stakeholder]] concurrence on scope definition and cost/schedule estimates. * Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases. * Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process. * Depth and breadth of any architectural prototype that was developed. * Establishing a baseline by which to compare actual expenditures versus planned expenditures. If the project does not pass this milestone, called the Lifecycle Objective Milestone, it either can be canceled or repeated after being redesigned to better meet the criteria. ==== Elaboration Phase ==== The primary objective is to mitigate the key risk items identified by analysis up to the end of this phase. The elaboration phase is where the project starts to take shape. In this phase the problem domain analysis is made and the architecture of the project gets its basic form. This phase must pass the Lifecycle Architecture Milestone by meeting the following deliverables: * A use-case model in which the use-cases and the actors have been identified and most of the use-case descriptions are developed. The use-case model should be 80% complete. * A description of the software architecture in a software system development process. * An [[Executable Architecture|executable architecture]] that realizes architecturally significant
