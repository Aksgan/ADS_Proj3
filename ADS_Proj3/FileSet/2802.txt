was built by [[Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.]], [[Boulder, Colorado]], as was the High-Gain Antenna Gimbal (HGAG). Four monochromatic hazard cameras ([[Hazcam]]s) are mounted on the rover's body, two in front and two behind. The instrument deployment device (IDD), also called the rover arm, holds the following: * [[Mössbauer spectrometer]] (MB) [[MIMOS II]], developed by Dr. Göstar Klingelhöfer at the [[Johannes Gutenberg]] University in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]], is used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.<ref>{{Cite journal |title= The miniaturized Mössbauer spectrometer MIMOS II for extraterrestrial and outdoor terrestrial applications: A status report |author= Klingelhöfer G., Bernhardt B., Foh J., Bonnes U., Rodionov D., De Souza P.

The particles are analyzed by the Mössbauer Spectrometer and [[X-ray]] Spectrometer to help determine the ratio of magnetic particles to non-magnetic particles and the composition of magnetic minerals in airborne dust and rocks that have been ground by the Rock Abrasion Tool. There are also magnets on the front of the rover, which are studied extensively by the Mössbauer spectrometer. * Microscopic Imager (MI) for obtaining close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and soils. Development was led by Ken Herkenhoff's team at the [[USGS]] [[Astrogeology Research Program]]. * [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT), developed by [[Honeybee Robotics]], for removing dusty and weathered rock surfaces and exposing fresh material for examination by instruments on-board. The robotic arm is able to place instruments directly up against rock and soil targets of interest. {{Clear}} ==Naming of ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity''== The ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' rovers were named through a student essay competition. The winning entry was by Sofi Collis, a third-grade Russian-American student from Arizona. <blockquote> I used to live in an orphanage. It was dark and cold and lonely. At night, I looked up at the sparkly sky and felt better. I dreamed I could fly there. In America, I can make all my dreams come true. Thank you for the 'Spirit' and the 'Opportunity.'<br /> — Sofi Collis, age 9 </blockquote> Prior to this, during the development and building of the rovers, they were known as MER-1 (''Opportunity'') and MER-2 (''Spirit''). Internally, NASA also uses the mission designations MER-A (''Spirit'') and MER-B (''Opportunity'') based on the order of landing on Mars (Spirit first then Opportunity).{{Clear}} ==Test rovers== [[File:Rover testing.jpg|thumb|Rover team members simulate ''Spirit'' in a Martian sandtrap.]]The Jet Propulsion Laboratory maintains a pair of rovers at its location in Pasadena for testing and modeling of situations on Mars. One test rover, weighing approximately {{convert|180|kg}}, is fully instrumented and nearly identical to ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity''. Another test version is identical in size and drive characteristics but does not include all instruments. It weighs in at {{convert|80|kg}}, much closer to the weight of ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' in the reduced gravity of Mars. These rovers were used in 2009 for a simulation of the incident in which ''Spirit'' became trapped in soft soil.<ref name="JPL Spirit free testing">{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-087|title=Mars and Earth Activities Aim to Get Spirit Rolling Again|date=May 18, 2009|accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> ==SAP== The NASA team uses a software application called ''SAP'' to view images collected from the rover, and to plan its daily activities.
