In the contraction Ω/''S'' by an arbitrary edge set ''S'', the edge set is ''E'' &minus; ''S''. (We let ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'').) The vertex set is the class of vertex sets of balanced components of the subgraph (''V'', ''S'') of Ω. That is, if (''V'', ''S'') has balanced components with vertex sets ''V''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''V''<sub>''k''</sub>, then Ω/''S'' has ''k'' vertices ''V''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''V''<sub>''k''</sub> . An edge ''e'' of Ω, not in ''S'', becomes an edge of Ω/''S'' and each endpoint ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''e'' in Ω that belongs to some ''V<sub>i</sub>'' becomes the endpoint ''V<sub>i</sub>'' of ''e'' in Ω/''S'' ; thus, an endpoint of ''e'' that is not in a balanced component of (''V'', ''S'') disappears. An edge with all endpoints in unbalanced components of (''V'', ''S'') becomes a loose edge in the contraction. An edge with only one endpoint in a balanced component of (''V'', ''S'') becomes a half-edge. An edge with two endpoints that belong to different balanced components becomes a link, and an edge with two endpoints that belong to the same balanced component becomes a loop. ==Matroids== There are two [[matroid]]s associated with a biased graph, both of which generalize the cycle matroid of a graph (Zaslavsky, 1991). ===The frame matroid=== The '''frame matroid''' (sometimes called '''bias matroid''') of a biased graph, ''M''(Ω), (Zaslavsky, 1989) has for its ground set the edge set ''E''. An edge set is independent if each component contains either no circles or just one circle, which is unbalanced. (In matroid theory a half-edge acts like an unbalanced loop and a loose edge acts like a balanced loop.) ''M''(Ω) is a frame matroid in the abstract sense, meaning that it's a submatroid of a matroid in which, for at least one basis, the set of lines generated by pairs of basis elements covers the whole matroid. Conversely, every abstract frame matroid is the frame matroid of some biased graph. There are four kinds of circuit of the matroid; they are called '''frame circuits''' or '''bias circuits'''. One is a balanced circle. Two other kinds are a pair of unbalanced circles together with a connecting simple path, such that the two circles are either disjoint (then the connecting path has one end in common with each circle and is otherwise disjoint from both) or share just a single common vertex (in this case the connecting path is that single vertex). The fourth kind of circuit is a theta graph in which every circle is unbalanced. The rank of an edge set ''S'' is ''n'' &minus; ''b'', where ''n'' is the number of vertices of ''G'' and ''b'' is the number of balanced components of ''S'', counting isolated vertices as balanced components. Minors of the frame matroid agree with minors of the biased graph; that is, ''M''(Ω&minus;''S'') = ''M''(Ω)&minus;''S'' and ''M''(Ω/''S'') = ''M''(Ω)/''S''. Frame matroids generalize the [[Dowling geometry|Dowling geometries]] associated with a group (Dowling, 1973). The frame matroid of a 2''C''<sub>''n''</sub> is called a '''swirl'''. It is important in matroid structure theory. ===The lift matroid=== The '''extended lift matroid''' ''L''<sub>0</sub>(''G'') has for its ground set the set ''E''<sub>0</sub> the union of ''E'' with an '''extra point''', which we denote ''e''<sub>0</sub>. The '''lift matroid''' ''L''(''G'') is the extended lift matroid restricted to ''E''. The extra point acts exactly like an unbalanced loop or a half-edge, so we describe only the lift matroid. An edge set is independent if it contains either no circles or just one circle, which is unbalanced. (This is the rule that is applied separately to each component in the frame matroid.) A matroid circuit is a balanced circle, a pair of unbalanced circles that are either disjoint or have just a common vertex, or a theta graph whose circles are all unbalanced. The rank of an edge set ''S'' is ''n'' &minus; ''c'' + ε, where ''c'' is the number of components of ''S'', counting isolated vertices, and ε is 0 if ''S'' is balanced and 1 if it is not. Minors of the lift and extended lift matroids agree in part with minors of the biased graph. Deletions agree: ''L''(Ω&minus;''S'') = ''L''(Ω)&minus;''S''. Contractions agree only for balanced edge sets: ''M''(Ω/''S'') = ''M''(Ω)/''S'' if ''S'' is balanced, but not if it is unbalanced. The lift matroid of a 2''C''<sub>''n''</sub> is called a '''spike'''. Spikes seem to be quite important in matroid structure theory. ==Multiary quasigroups== Just as a group expansion of a complete graph ''K''<sub>''n''</sub> encodes the group (see [[Dowling geometry]]), its combinatorial analog expanding a simple cycle of length ''n'' + 1 encodes an ''n''-ary (multiary) [[Quasigroup#Polyadic or multiary quasigroups|quasigroup]]. It is possible to prove theorems about multiary quasigroups by means of biased graphs (Zaslavsky, t.a.) ==References== *T. A. Dowling (1973), A class of geometric lattices based on finite groups.
