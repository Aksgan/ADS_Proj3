|accessdate=16 May 2009 }}</ref> Originally SPF stood for '''Sender Permitted From''' and was sometimes also called SMTP+SPF, but it was changed to Sender Policy Framework in February 2004. In early 2004, the IETF created the [[MARID]] working group and tried to use SPF and Microsoft's CallerID proposal as the basis for what is now known as [[Sender ID]]. After the collapse of MARID the SPF community returned to the original "classic" version of SPF. In July 2005 this version of the specification was approved by the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group|IESG]] as an IETF ''experiment'', inviting the community to observe SPF during the two years following publication. On April 28, 2006, the SPF [[Request for Comment|RFC]] was published as experimental RFC 4408. == Controversy == In 2004, [[Steven M. Bellovin]] wrote an e-mail that discusses his concerns with SPF.<ref>[http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200401/msg00037.html Steve Bellovin expresses doubts] (Jan 2004)</ref> Some of these include: * SPF originally used TXT records in DNS, which are supposed to be free-form text with no semantics attached. SPF proponents readily acknowledge that it would be better to have records specifically designated for SPF, but this choice was made to enable rapid implementation of SPF. In July 2005, [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] assigned the Resource Record type 99 to SPF. During the transition, SPF publishers may publish both record types and SPF checkers may check for either type. It may likely take many years before all DNS software fully supports this new record. * As of the time he wrote his message, there was no consensus that this is the right way to go. Some major e-mail service providers have not bought into this scheme. Unless and until they do, it does not help much, either for their customers (who make up a substantial proportion of the user population) or for everyone else (since their addresses could be forged). It is worth noting that since this concern was raised, Google Mail and AOL, among others, have embraced SPF.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://postmaster.aol.com/spf/ |title=SPF Information |publisher=AOL Postmaster |accessdate=2007-10-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070708214600/http://www.postmaster.aol.com/spf/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-07-08}}</ref> * Bellovin's strongest concerns involve the underlying assumptions of SPF (SPF's "semantic model"). When using SPF, the SPF DNS records determine how a sender is allowed to send. That means that the owner of the domain will control how senders are allowed to send. People who use "portable" e-mail addresses (such as e-mail addresses created by professional organizations) will be required to use the domain owner's SMTP sender, which may not currently even exist. Organizations providing these "portable" addresses could, however, create their own ''[[mail submission agent]]s'' (MSAs) (RFC 4409) or offer [[Virtual Private Network|VPNs]]. Besides, SPF only ties the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] Return-Path to permitted MSAs; users are still free to use their RFC 2822 addresses elsewhere. There are other concerns about the impact of widespread use of SPF, notably the impact on various legitimate forms of email spoofing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taugh.com/mp/lmap.html |title=Problems with Designated Sender |publisher=Taughannock Networks |accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref> such as forwarding services, SMTP use by people with multiple identities, etc. (For example, a person who uses their home ISP's SMTP servers to send mail with their work email as the address.) On the other hand, many of these uses may be "expected" yet not "legitimate". To a certain extent this is more a question of ownership and expectations than a technical question. ==Deployment== Anti-spam software such as [[SpamAssassin]] version 3.0.0 and [[Anti-Spam SMTP Proxy|ASSP]] implement SPF. Many [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs) support SPF directly such as [[Courier Mail Server|Courier]], CommuniGate Pro, [[Wildcat! BBS|Wildcat]], and [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]], or have patches/plug-ins available that support SPF, including [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]], [[Sendmail]], [[Exim]], and [[Qmail]].
