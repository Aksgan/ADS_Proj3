By [http://toreopsahl.com/2009/02/06/operationalisation-of-tie-strength/ recording the strength of ties], a weighted network can be created (also known as a valued network). Below is an example of such a network: [[File:Weighted network.png]] ==Measures for weighted networks== Although weighted networks are more difficult to analyse than if ties were simply present or absent, a number of network measures has been proposed for weighted networks: * Node degree: The sum of weights attached to ties belonging to a node (Barrat et al., 2004)<ref name="barrat04" /> * Closeness: Redefined by using Dijkstra's distance algorithm (Newman, 2001)<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.64.016132 | author = [[Mark E J Newman]] | title = Scientific collaboration networks: II.

It is an extension to '''[[Random early detection]]''' (RED) where a single queue may have several different queue thresholds. Each queue threshold is associated to a particular [[Type of Service|IP precedence]] or [[DSCP]] (for [[DiffServ]]), etc.. For example: A queue may have lower thresholds for lower priority packet. A queue buildup will cause the lower priority packets to be dropped, hence protecting the higher priority packets in the same [[Queue (data structure)|queue]]. In this way [[Quality of service|QoS]] prioritization is made possible for important [[packets]] from a pool of packets using the same buffer.<ref>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/11_2/feature/guide/wred_gs.html Cisco web page explaining WRED</ref> ==Reference== <references/> [[Category:Network performance]] {{Compu-network-stub}} {{Internet-stub}} [[da:Undgåelse af datanet-trafikforstoppelse#RED og WRED]] [[ru:Weighted random early detection]] [[sk:Weighted RED]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40008</id> <title>Weil conjectures</title> <text>{{dablink|Other "Weil conjectures" include the [[modularity theorem|Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture]] about elliptic curves, and the [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]].}} In [[mathematics]], the '''Weil conjectures''' were some highly-influential proposals by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|first=André |last=Weil|year=1949}} on the [[generating function]]s (known as [[local zeta-function]]s) derived from counting the number of points on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s. A variety ''V'' over a finite field with ''q'' elements has a finite number of [[rational points]], as well as points over every finite field with ''q''<sup>''k''</sup> elements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers ''N''<sub>''k''</sub> of points over the (essentially unique) field with ''q''<sup>''k''</sup> elements. Weil conjectured that such ''zeta-functions'' should be [[rational function]]s, should satisfy a form of [[functional equation]], and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the [[Riemann zeta function]] and [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The rationality was proved by {{harvtxt|Dwork|1960}}, the functional equation by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1965}}, and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}} ==Background and history== The earliest antecedent of the Weil conjectures is by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and appears in section VII of his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' {{harv|Mazur|1974}}, concerned with [[roots of unity]] and [[Gaussian period]]s. In article 358, he moves on from the periods that build up towers of quadratic extensions, for the construction of regular polygons; and assumes that ''p'' is a prime number such that {{nowrap|''p'' &minus; 1}} is divisible by 3. Then there is a [[cyclic cubic field]] inside the cyclotomic field of ''p''th roots of unity, and a [[normal integral basis]] of periods for the integers of this field (an instance of the [[Hilbert–Speiser theorem]]). Gauss constructs the order-3 periods, corresponding to the [[cyclic group]] ('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')<sup>&times;</sup> of non-zero residues modulo ''p'' under multiplication and its unique subgroup of index three. Gauss lets <math>\mathfrak{R}</math>, <math>\mathfrak{R}'</math>, and <math>\mathfrak{R}''</math> be its cosets. Taking the periods (sums of roots of unity) corresponding to these cosets applied to exp(2&pi;''i''/''p''), he notes that these periods have a multiplication table that is accessible to calculation. Products are
