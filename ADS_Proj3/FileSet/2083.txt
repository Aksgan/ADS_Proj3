The intersection of the IS and LM curves is the "General Equilibrium" where there is simultaneous equilibrium in both markets.<ref>Robert J. Gordon, Macroeconomics eleventh edition, 2009</ref> IS/LM stands for [[Investment]] [[Saving]] / [[Liquidity preference]] [[Money supply]]. ==History== The '''IS'''/'''LM''' model was born at the Econometric Conference held in Oxford during September, 1936. [[Roy Harrod]], [[John Hicks|John R. Hicks]], and [[James Meade]] all presented papers describing [[mathematical model]]s attempting to summarize [[John Maynard Keynes]]' ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]''. Hicks, who had seen a draft of Harrod's paper, invented the '''IS'''/'''LM''' model (originally using LL, not LM). He later presented it in "Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested Interpretation".<ref>Hicks, J. R. (1937), "Mr. Keynes and the Classics - A Suggested Interpretation", ''Econometrica'', v. 5 (April): 147-159.</ref> Hicks later agreed that the model missed important points from the Keynesian theory, criticizing it as having very limited use beyond "a classroom gadget", and criticizing equilibrium methods generally: "When one turns to questions of policy, looking towards the future instead of the past, the use of equilibrium methods is still more suspect."<ref>Hicks, John (1980-1981), "IS-LM: An Explanation", ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'', v. 3: 139-155</ref> The first problem was that it presents the real and monetary sectors as separate, something Keynes attempted to transcend. In addition, an equilibrium model ignores uncertainty – and that [[liquidity preference]] only makes sense in the presence of uncertainty "For there is no sense in liquidity, unless expectations are uncertain."<ref>(Hicks 1980-1981)</ref> A shift in the '''IS''' or '''LM''' curve will cause change in expectations, causing the other curve to shift. Most modern macroeconomists see the '''IS'''/'''LM''' model as being at best a first approximation for understanding the real world. Although disputed in some circles and accepted to be imperfect, the model is widely used and seen as useful in gaining an understanding of macroeconomic theory. It is used in most college macroeconomics textbooks. ==Formulation== The model is presented as a graph of two intersecting lines in the first quadrant. The horizontal axis represents [[national income]] or [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] [[gross domestic product]] and is labelled '''''Y'''.'' The vertical axis represents the real [[interest]] rate, '''''i'''.'' Since this is a non-dynamic model, there is a fixed relationship between the [[nominal interest rate]] and the [[real interest rate]] (the former equals the latter plus the expected inflation rate which is [[exogeny|exogenous]] in the short run); therefore variables such as money demand which actually depend on the nominal interest rate can equivalently be expressed as depending on the real interest rate. The point where these schedules intersect represents a short-run [[General equilibrium|equilibrium]] in the real and monetary sectors (though not necessarily in other sectors, such as labor markets): both the product market and the money market are in equilibrium. This equilibrium yields a unique combination of the interest rate and [[real GDP]]. ===IS curve=== For the IS curve, the independent variable is the interest rate and the dependent variable is the level of income (even though the interest rate is plotted vertically). The '''IS''' curve is drawn as downward-[[slope|sloping]] with the interest rate ('''i''') on the vertical axis and [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] (gross domestic product: '''Y''') on the horizontal axis. The initials '''IS''' stand for "'''I'''nvestment and '''S'''aving equilibrium" but since 1937 have been used to represent the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all equilibria where total spending (consumer spending + planned private investment + government purchases + net exports) equals an economy's total output (equivalent to real income, Y, or GDP). To keep the link with the historical meaning, the '''IS''' curve can be said to represent the equilibria where total private investment equals total saving, where the latter equals consumer saving ''plus'' government saving (the budget surplus) ''plus'' foreign saving (the trade surplus). In equilibrium, all spending is desired or planned; there is no unplanned inventory accumulation (i.e., no [[general glut]] of goods and services).<ref>{{Citation | first = Gonçalo L. | last = Fonseca | url = http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//essays/classic/glut.htm | title = The General Glut Controversy | publisher = [[The New School]] }}</ref> The level of real GDP ('''Y''') is determined along this line for each [[interest rate]]. Thus the '''IS''' curve is a [[locus of points]] of equilibrium in the "real" (non-financial) economy. Given expectations about returns on fixed investment, every level of the real interest rate ('''i''') will generate a certain level of planned fixed [[investment]] and other interest-sensitive spending: lower interest rates encourage higher fixed investment and the like. Income is at the equilibrium level for a given interest rate when the saving that [[consumer]]s and other economic participants choose to do out of this income equals investment (or, equivalently, when "leakages" from
