sequence of elements required to support a business service. The combination of one or more OBASHI diagrams form a contextual model for analysis. ===The OBASHI Framework=== These Layers provide the framework for organising the elements that represent individual Business or IT assets / resources. The six layers are: *'''O'''wnership *'''B'''usiness Process *'''A'''pplication *'''S'''ystem *'''H'''ardware *'''I'''nfrastructure They are collectively know as OBASHI [[File:OBASHI Owner element.jpg|right|thumb|100px]] ====Ownership Layer==== The Ownership Layer contains elements representing the person(s) or group(s) that ‘owns’, or is responsible for, business processes portrayed in the Business Layer. Ownership elements can be positioned beneath other ownership elements to create a hierarchy of owners. Example owners could be: ''Accountancy'', ''Planning Manager'', ''Logistics'', ''New York'', ''Purchasing Officer'' and ''Environmental Health''. [[Image:OBASHI Business Element.jpg|right|thumb|100px]] ====Business Layer==== The Business Layer contains elements representing the business processes or functions that are being used by the ‘Owner(s)’. These elements are positioned under their appropriate ‘Owner’. Examples could be: ''Monthly Balance'', ''Sales Transactions'', ''Tank Stock Management'', ''Production Data'' and ''Capture Budgeting''. [[Image:OBASHI Application Element.jpg|right|thumb|100px]] ====Application Layer==== The Application Layer contains elements representing software applications. These are positioned beneath the business processes that utilise them. Examples could include: ''Excel'', ''Oracle'', ''Sage'', ''SAP'' and ''PeopleSoft''. [[Image:OBASHI System Element.jpg|right|thumb|100px]] ====System Layer==== The System Layer contains elements representing the operating systems on which the applications run. These elements are positioned beneath the appropriate applications. Examples could be: ''Windows XP'', ''Unix'', ''Solaris'', ''Linux'' and ''Vista''. [[Image:OBASHI Hardware Element.jpg|right|thumb|100px]] ====Hardware Layer ==== The Hardware Layer contains elements representing the computer hardware on which the operating systems run. These elements are positioned beneath the appropriate operating systems. Examples could be: ''Workstations'', ''Servers'', ''Laptops'', ''Tablet PCs'', and ''Mainframes''. [[Image:OBASHI Infrastructure Element.jpg|right|thumb|100px]] ====Infrastructure Layer==== The Infrastructure Layer contains elements representing the network infrastructure into which the hardware is connected. Infrastructure elements can be positioned beneath other infrastructure elements to create a hierarchy that supports the business. Examples could be: ''Switches'', ''Routers'', ''Multiplexers'', ''Bridges'' and ''Hubs''. ===B&IT Diagrams=== The '''OBASHI framework''' is used to create Business and IT ''(B&IT)'' diagrams. A B&IT diagram is a diagrammatic representation of the logical and physical relationships (connectivity) between an organisation’s IT assets and resources and the business operations which they support. A B&IT diagram is made up of elements. Individual elements represent individual business and IT assets and resources. By employing the OBASHI framework, B&IT diagrams are able to accurately depict the complex inter-relationships and dependencies of business processes, IT resources and dataflows in an easy-to-understand visual format. Through the use of a tool which supports the OBASHI Framework a repository of elements and relationships can be established. By using a graphical interface to create the B&IT diagrams the tool can build an interactive model of these relationships, with the B&IT diagram acting as a dynamic interface. [[Image:Stroma Business and IT Diagram.jpg|800px]] Behind each element information can be stored within the repository: business, financial and/or technical. This data may be captured manually, or automatically from data held within existing systems. This information can then be viewed, manipulated and analysed within its business context. ===Rules=== The '''OBASHI Framework''' comprises the following rules which govern the implicit and explicit relationships between elements. ## An element placed beneath or above another element has an implicit relationship with that element. ## All elements within the same layer have an implicit relationship to each other. ## Connected elements have an explicit relationship to each other, with the following rules governing connectivity: ### A connection is a [[bi-directional relationship]] ### An Infrastructure element may be connected to one or more Infrastructure or Hardware elements. ### A Hardware element may be connected to one or more Infrastructure or System elements. ### A System element may be connected to one or more Hardware or Application elements. ### An Application element may be connected to one or more System, Application or Business elements. ### A Business element may be connected to one or more Application, Business or Owner elements. ### An Owner element may be connected to one or more Business or Owner elements. ## A dependency is a uni-directional relationship i.e. element X may be dependent on element Y, but element Y might not be dependent on element X. ## An element may have one or more instances within a layer. ## An element can exist on more than one OBASHI diagram. ## A dataflow comprises two or more connected elements. ## A dataflow can contain one or more dataflows, enabling a hierarchy of dataflows. ## A dataflow may span multiple Business and IT diagrams. ===The Dataflow Analysis View (DAV)=== The '''OBASHI Dataflow Analysis View''' (''DAV'') is a graphical and statistical representation of all the business and IT resources, and attributed financial values, that support an individual data flow. A '''DAV''' illustrates to business professionals how and why IT systems interact with day to day business processes. All of the physical assets required for the logical data flow to exist are documented as a [[sequence]]. A sequence shows all of the IT and Business assets and resources involved in the data flow. [[Image:OBASHI Dataflow Analysis View.jpg|800px]] The '''DAV''' enables cost/value statistics to be generated to understand the contribution IT assets make to the business. Analysis of the '''DAV''' can highlight vulnerabilities, mis-alignment and areas for consolidation. ==Fields of use== The OBASHI Methodology can be used in the following fields: *[[Availability]] *[[Business architecture|Business Architecture]] *[[Business continuity planning|Business Continuity]] *[[Business process management|Business Process Management (BPM)]] *[[Business Service Management]] *[[Business Technology Optimization|Business Technology Optimisation (BTO)]] *[[Change Management (ITSM)|Change Management]] *CHAZOP (Computer Hazardous Operation Analysis) *[[COBIT]] *[[Data center|Data Center Management]] *[[Enterprise architecture|Enterprise Architecture (EA)]] *[[Information technology audit|Governance & Auditing]] *[[Grid computing|Grid Computing]] *[[Information architecture|Information Architecture (IA)]] *[[Enterprise Information Security Architecture|Enterprise Information Security Architecture (EISA)]] *[[Infrastructure Management]] *[[IT Service Management]] *[[Information security|IT Security]] *[[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]] *[[Utility Computing|On Demand/Utility Computing]] *[[Performability]] *[[Risk management|Risk Management]] *[[Service-oriented architecture|Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)]] *[[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]] *[[Technical architecture|Technical Architecture]] ==See also== {{Multicol}} ;Business Strategy *[[Business continuity planning|Business continuity]] *[[Business analysis]] *[[Disaster recovery]] *[[Process modeling]] {{multicol-break}} ; Architecture *[[Business architecture]] *[[Information architecture]] *[[Process architecture]] *[[Systems analyst]] *[[Systems
