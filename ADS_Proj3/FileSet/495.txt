applied sciences: solutions of problems in mechanics, physics, chemical kinetics are very often representable by functions of bounded variation. The book {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} details a very ample set of mathematical physics applications of ''BV'' functions. Also there is some modern application which deserves a brief description. *The [[Mumford-Shah functional]]: the segmentation problem for a two-dimensional image, i.e. the problem of faithful reproduction of contours and grey scales is equivalent to the [[minimum|minimization]] of such [[functional]]. ==See also== <div style="-moz-column-count:4; column-count:4;"> * [[Renato Caccioppoli]] * [[Caccioppoli set]] * [[Lamberto Cesari]] * [[Ennio de Giorgi]] * [[Helly's selection theorem]] * [[Locally integrable function]] * [[Lp space|''L''<sup>''p''</sup>(&Omega;) space]] * [[Lebesgue&ndash;Stieltjes integral]] * [[Radon measure]] * [[Reduced derivative]] * [[Riemann&ndash;Stieltjes integral]] * [[Total variation]] * [[Aizik Isaakovich Vol'pert]] </div> ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}} ==References== *[[Luigi Ambrosio|Ambrosio]], Luigi; Fusco, Nicola; Pallara, Diego (2000) Functions of bounded variation and free discontinuity problems.
