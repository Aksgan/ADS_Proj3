In this example, the threshold values are 1v and 3v).It incorporates [[Zener diodes]] to create a large offset between logic 1 and logic 0 voltage levels.These devices usually ran off a 15 volt power supply and were found in industrial control, where the high differential was intended to minimize the effect of noise. == Advantages == *Increased Noise Margin *Spike Control *High Noise Threshold Value == Usage == It is used extensively in industrial environments. e.g. *Logic Controllers with heavy noise *Heavy Process Machinery == See also == *[[Diode logic]] (DL) *[[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) *[[Integrated injection logic]] (I2L) *[[Resistor–transistor logic]] (RTL) *[[Transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Logic families]] {{electronics-stub}} {{Logic Families}}</text> </page> <page> <id>16691</id> <title>High Throughput File System</title> <text>'''High Throughput File System''' (HTFS) is the [[journaling file system|journaling]] [[file system]] used by current versions of [[SCO OpenServer]].

At the next step, one obtains [[cobordism]]s with corners via [[natural transformation]]s of such 2-functors. A claim was then made that, with the [[gauge group]] [[SU(2)]], ``''the extended [[TQFT]], or ETQFT, gives a theory equivalent to the [[Ponzano-Regge model]] of [[quantum gravity]]''";<ref>http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/ March 18, 2009.

Therefore, according to the construction proposed by Jeffrey Morton, one can describe the [[state space]] of a gauge theory – or many kinds of quantum field theories ([[QFT]]s) and local quantum physics, in terms of the [[transformation groupoid]]s given by symmetries, as for example in the case of a gauge theory, by the [[gauge transformation]]s acting on states that are, in this case, connections. In the case of symmetries related to [[quantum group]]s, one would obtain structures that are representation categories of [[quantum groupoid]]s,<ref>http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/QuantumCategory.html Quantum Categories of Quantum Groupoids</ref> instead of the 2-[[vector space]]s that are representation categories of groupoids. ==Double categories, Category of categories and Supercategories== A higher level concept is thus defined as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of categories, or '''super-category''', which generalises to higher dimensions the notion of [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &ndash; regarded as any structure which is an interpretation of [[Lawvere]]'s axioms of the ''elementary theory of abstract categories'' (ETAC).<ref>Lawvere, F.
