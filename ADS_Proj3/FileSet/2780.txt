thereby accelerating the boot process for users during the day. Instead, a full virus scan is scheduled during the maintenance window, but is not needed at every startup. Using a maintenance window requires increased specialization of skill of the IT staff, and requires a certain amount of time set up, test, and deploy. For small businesses with only a few employees, it may be less complicated to just go around and manually apply updates at each computer, rather than spending hours trying to set up deployment through a maintenance window. {{DEFAULTSORT:Maintenance Window}} [[Category:Maintenance]] {{Compu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>23318</id> <title>Major stationary source</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} A '''major stationary source''' is a source that emits more than a certain amount of a [[pollutant]] as defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). The amount of pollutants allowed for certain new sources is defined by the EPA's [[New Source Performance Standard]]s (NSPS). A '''stationary source''' in air quality terminology is any fixed emitter of air pollutants, such as [[fossil fuel]] burning [[power plant]]s, [[petroleum refineries]], [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[Food processing|food processing plants]] and other heavy industrial sources. A '''mobile source''' in air quality terminology is a non-stationary source of air pollutants, such as automobiles, buses, trucks, ships, trains, aircraft and various other vehicles. ==See also== *[[Air pollution dispersion terminology]] *[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]] *[[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]] *[[Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Major Stationary Source}} [[Category:United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Category:Air dispersion modeling]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23319</id> <title>Majority function</title> <text>In [[Boolean logic]], the '''majority function''' (also called the '''median operator''') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''n'' inputs to one output. The value of the operation is false when ''n''/2 or more arguments are false, and true otherwise. Alternatively, representing true values as 1 and false values as 0, we may use the formula :<math>\operatorname{Majority} \left ( p_1,\dots,p_n \right ) = \left \lfloor \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i - 1/2}{n} \right \rfloor. </math> The "&minus;1/2" in the formula serves to break ties in favor of zeros when ''n'' is even; a similar formula can be used for a function that breaks ties in favor of ones. A major result in [[circuit complexity]] asserts that this function cannot be computed by [[AC0|AC0 circuits]] of subexponential size. A ''majority gate'' is a [[logical gate]] used in [[circuit complexity]] and other applications of [[Boolean circuits]]. A majority gate returns true if and only if more than 50% of its inputs are true. == Monotone formulae for majority == For ''n'' = 1 the median operator is just the unary identity operation ''x''. For ''n'' = 3 the ternary median operator can be expressed using conjunction and disjunction as ''xy'' + ''yz'' + ''zx''. Remarkably this expression denotes the same operation independently of whether the symbol + is interpreted as [[disjunction|inclusive or]] or [[exclusive or]]. For an arbitrary ''n'' there exists a monotone formula for majority of size O(''n''<sup>5.3</sup>) {{harv|Valiant|1984}}. This is proved using [[probabilistic method]]. Thus, this formula is non-constructive. However, one can obtain an explicit formula for majority of polynomial size using a [[sorting network]] of [[Miklós Ajtai|Ajtai]], [[János Komlós (mathematician)|Komlós]], and [[Endre Szemerédi|Szemerédi]]. == Properties == Among the properties of the ternary median operator < x,y,z > are: # < x,y,y > = y # < x,y,z > = < z,x,y > # < x,y,z > = < x,z,y > # < < x,w,y > ,w,z > = < x,w, < y,w,z > > An abstract system satisfying these as axioms is a [[median algebra]]. ==References== *{{Cite journal | first = L. | last = Valiant | authorlink = Leslie Valiant | title = Short monotone formulae for the majority function | journal = Journal of Algorithms | volume = 5 | year = 1984 | pages = 363–366 | doi = 10.1016/0196-6774(84)90016-6 | ref = harv | postscript = <!--None-->}}. * {{ cite book | last=Knuth | first=Donald E. | authorlink=Donald Knuth | title=Introduction to combinatorial algorithms and Boolean functions | series=[[The Art of Computer Programming]] | volume=4.0 | date=2008 | isbn=0-321-53496-4 | pages=64–74 | publisher=Addison-Wesley | location=Upper Saddle River, NJ }} ==See also== * [[Boolean algebra (structure)]] * [[Boolean algebras canonically defined]] * [[Majority problem (cellular automaton)]] [[Category:Logic gates]] [[Category:Circuit complexity]] [[Category:Boolean algebra]] [[es:Función mayorante]] [[ru:Мажоритарный элемент]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23326</id> <title>MakerBot Industries</title> <text>[[File:MakerBot Founders and Final Prototypes.jpg|thumb|right|MakerBot founders (left to right) Adam Mayer, Zach Smith and [[Bre Pettis]] with the final MakerBot prototypes]] '''MakerBot Industries''' is a company founded in January 2009 by [[Bre Pettis]], Adam Mayer, and Zach “Hoeken” Smith producing an [[open source]] [[3D printing|3D printer]] [[rapid prototyping]] machine called the Cupcake CNC.
