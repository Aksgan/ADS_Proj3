of date. Organizations can have up to twenty generations of backup. =====Partial backups===== This only occurs when parts of the master file are backed up. The master file is usually backed up to [[magnetic tape]] at regular times, this could be daily, weekly or monthly. Completed transactions since the last backup are stored separately and are called '''journals''', or '''journal files'''. The master file can be recreated from the journal files on the backup tape if the system is to fail. ====Updating in a batch==== This is used when transactions are recorded on paper (such as bills and invoices) or when it's being stored on a [[magnetic tape]]. Transactions will be collected and updated as a batch at when it's convenient or economical to process them. Historically, this was the most common method as the [[information technology]] did not exist to allow real-time processing. The two stages in batch processing are: * Collecting and storage of the transaction data into a transaction file - this involves sorting the data into sequential order. * Processing the data by updating the master file - which can be difficult, this may involve data additions, updates and deletions that may require to happen in a certain order. If an error occurs, then the entire batch fails. Updating in batch requires [[sequential access]] - since it uses a [[magnetic tape]] this is the only way to access data. A batch will start at the beginning of the tape, then reading it from the order it was stored; it's very time-consuming to locate specific transactions. The [[information technology]] used includes a [[secondary storage]] medium which can store large quantities of data inexpensively (thus the common choice of a [[magnetic tape]]). The [[software]] used to collect data does not have to be online - it doesn't even need a [[user interface]]. ====Updating in real-time==== This is the immediate processing of data. It provides instant confirmation of a transaction. This involves a large amount of users who are simultaneously performing transactions to change data. Because of advances in technology (such as the increase in the speed of [[data transmission]] and larger [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]), real-time updating is now possible. Steps in a real-time update involve the sending of a transaction data to an online database in a master file. The person providing information is usually able to help with error correction and receives confirmation of the transaction completion. Updating in real-time uses [[direct access]] of data. This occurs when data are accessed without accessing previous data items. The storage device stores data in a particular location based on a mathematical procedure. This will then be calculated to find an approximate location of the data. If data are not found at this location, it will search through successive locations until it's found. The [[information technology]] used could be a [[secondary storage]] medium that can store large amounts of data and provide quick access (thus the common choice of a [[magnetic disk]]). It requires a user-friendly interface as it's important for rapid response time. '''Reservation Systems''' Reservation systems are used for any type of business where a service or a product is set aside for a customer to use for a future time. ==References== {{reflist}} # {{note|HSC}}{{note label|HSC|1|a}} [http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ipt/trans_systems/4-1/what_is_tps.htm NSW HSC Online] # {{note|Gray&ReuterTPOverview}}{{note label|Gray&ReuterTPOverview|2|a}}{{note label|Gray&ReuterTPOverview|2|b}}{{note label|Gray&ReuterTPOverview|2|c}} [http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:fK7dQdEJB7AJ:research.microsoft.com/~gray/WICS_99_TP/01_WhirlwindTour.ppt+%22ACID+Properties:+First+Definition%22&hl=en&gl=ca&ct=clnk&cd=1 WICS TP Chapter 1] ==See also== * [[Transaction processing]] * [[Online transaction processing]] * [[Customer Integrated System]] ==Further reading== * Gerhard Weikum, Gottfried Vossen, ''Transactional information systems: theory, algorithms, and the practice of concurrency control and recovery'', Morgan Kaufmann, 2002, ISBN 1558605088 [[Category:Accounting software]] [[Category:Information systems]] [[Category:Transaction processing|Transaction processing system]] [[es:Sistema de procesamiento de transacciones]] [[ko:거래 처리 시스템]] [[it:Transaction Processing System]] [[he:מערכת עיבוד תנועות]] [[pt:Sistema de processamento de transações]] [[zh:交易處理系統]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38089</id> <title>Transcription (software)</title> <text>'''Transcription software''' is software which assists in the conversion of human speech into a text transcript. The primary meaning of the term "transcription software" has changed over time, with the introduction of new technologies such as natural language speech recognition. References also depend on the context of the purpose for the transcript. The term "transcription software" can refer to a completely automated solution, or to software which helps a human transcriptionist manually transcribe spoken-word audio into text transcripts. In the latter case, the term [[Digital dictation|"digital dictation"]] is sometimes used. Transcription software, as with [[transcription (service)|transcription service]] is often provided for business, legal, or [[medical transcription|medical purposes]]. Compared with audio content, a text transcript is searchable, takes up less computer memory, and can be used as an alternate communication method, such as for closed captions. The definition of transcription "software" as compared with transcription "service" is generally defined by the ability of a user to run the entire system by itself on a local computer or server, without the use of a service-provider. However, the advent of [[SaaS|software-as-a-service]] and cloud computing models blur this distinction. ==Transcription Software Products & Vendors== A number of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription software]] tools have been built for use in linguistic research. Other transcription software is developed for commercial sale, including those on this list of companies and products: * InqScribe - * NCH Software - Express Scribe * Nuance - Dictaphone *[[Nuance]] - [[Dragon NaturallySpeaking]] *[[Nuance]] - eScription *[[Nuance]] - [[MacSpeech Scribe]] *[[Nuance]] - PowerScribe * Scribe Healthcare Technologies * [[Vocapia]] - [[VoxSigma|VoxSigma speech-to-text]] * [[Digital dictation software|Winscribe]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Speech Recognition}} [[Category:Speech recognition]] [[Category:Lists of software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38090</id> <title>Transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages</title> <text>[[Image:Gurre.png|300px|thumb|A page from an 1856 book illustrating the letters of the alphabet for [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] at that time.

The [[Latin alphabet]] of the colonizers was inevitably used for the '''transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages''', but the details of how the sounds were represented has varied over time and from writer to writer, sometimes resulting in a great many variant spellings of the same word or name. ==Early writing==
