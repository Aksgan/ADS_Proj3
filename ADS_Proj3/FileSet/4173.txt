Finally, the speed of light can be used with [[time of flight]] measurements to measure large distances to high precision. [[Ole Rømer]] first demonstrated in 1676 that light travelled at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that the speed of light in vacuum was independent of the source or inertial frame of reference, and explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of [[special relativity]] and showing that the parameter ''c'' had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism. After centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} with a relative [[measurement uncertainty]] of 4 parts per billion. In 1983, the [[metre]] was redefined in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in {{frac|1|{{val|299792458}}}} of a [[second]]. As a result, the numerical value of ''c'' in metres per second is now fixed exactly by the definition of the metre.<ref name=BIPM_SI_units>{{SIbrochure|page=112}}</ref> {{TOC limit}} ==Numerical value, notation, and units== The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by ''c'', for "constant" or the Latin {{lang|la|''[[celeritas]]''}} (meaning "swiftness"). Originally, the symbol ''V'' was used, introduced by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1865. In 1856, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] used ''c'' for a constant later shown to equal {{radic|2}} times the speed of light in vacuum. In 1894, [[Paul Drude]] redefined ''c'' with its modern meaning. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used ''V'' in his [[Annus Mirabilis papers|original German-language papers]] on special relativity in 1905<!--, the 1923 English translation of them by Perrett and Jeffery using ''c''-->, but in 1907 he switched to ''c'', which by then had become the standard symbol.<ref name=Yc> {{cite web |last=Gibbs |first=P |year=2004 |origyear=1997 |title=Why is ''c'' the symbol for the speed of light? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/c.html |work=Usenet Physics FAQ |publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]] |accessdate=2009-11-16 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lLMPPN4L |archivedate=2009-11-17 }}</ref><ref> {{cite journal |last=Mendelson |first=KS |year=2006 |title=The story of ''c'' |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=995–997 |doi=10.1119/1.2238887 |format=subscription required }}</ref> Sometimes ''c'' is used for the speed of waves in ''any'' material medium, and ''c''<sub>0</sub> for the speed of light in vacuum.<ref name=handbook>See for example: *{{Cite book |last=Lide |first=DR |year=2004 |title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WDll8hA006AC&pg=PT76&dq=speed+of+light+%22c0+OR+%22 |pages=2–9 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=0849304857 }} *{{Cite book |last=Harris |first=JW |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2002 |title=Handbook of Physics |url=http://books.google.com/?id=c60mCxGRMR8C&pg=PA499&dq=speed+of+light+%22c0+OR+%22+date:2000-2009 |page=499 |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |isbn=0-387-95269-1 }} *{{Cite book |last=Whitaker |first=JC |year=2005 |title=The Electronics Handbook |url=http://books.google.com/?id=FdSQSAC3_EwC&pg=PA235&dq=speed+of+light+c0+handbook |page=235 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=0849318890 }} *{{Cite book |last=Cohen |first=ER |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2007 |title=Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TElmhULQoeIC&pg=PA143&dq=speed+of+light+c0+handbook |page=184 |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |isbn=0854044337 }}</ref> This subscripted notation, which is endorsed in official SI literature,<ref name=BIPM_SI_units /> has the same form as other related constants: namely, ''μ''<sub>0</sub> for the [[vacuum permeability]] or magnetic constant, ''ε''<sub>0</sub> for the [[vacuum permittivity]] or electric constant, and ''Z''<sub>0</sub> for the [[impedance of free space]].
