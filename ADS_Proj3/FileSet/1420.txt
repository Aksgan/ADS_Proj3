OSHA requires employers to take steps to reduce exposure levels when the TWA reaches 90 dB(A). The EAV is to ensure that the exposure levels do not reach 90 dB(A) or more. It is also to ensure that employees are not experiencing [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. == Use == A noise [[dosimeter]] is used to measure noise exposures to employees. Dosimeters can be used to determine the TWA. If it is determined that levels of noise exposure have reached the EAV, employers are required to implement a hearing conservation program. The hearing conservation program consists of many different aspects. The first aspect is monitoring. The employer is required to monitor noise exposure for all of its employees who may be exposed at a TWA at or above 85 dB(A). This is to identify employees for inclusion in the hearing conservation program and to enable the proper selection of hearing protectors. The second aspect is the audiometric testing program. Employees exposed to levels at or above the EAV will undergo audiometric testing. The first test is called a baseline. It provides a standard to compare future audiometric tests to. If a significant change in hearing capabilities occurs (called a standard threshold shift) greater steps must be taken to ensure the employee is protected from high levels of noise exposure. The third aspect is the implementation of hearing protection. Employers must make hearing protection available to all employees who are exposed to noise levels of 85 dB(A) or greater. This is to be at no cost to employees. Employees can pick whichever type of hearing protection they prefer. This also requires an ongoing evaluation of the hearing protection. The fourth aspect is a training program. The training program must cover the effects of noise on hearing, the purpose of hearing protection, and the purpose of audiometric testing. The last aspect is record keeping. Records of employee audiometric tests must be retained for two years. This information must also be available to the employees. == Vibration == <!-- Deleted image removed: [[image: Hse-gov-uk-elv-values.JPG|thumb|550px|right|''EAV's'' and ''ELV's'' given by the Health and Safety Executive of the UK|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 6 September 2009}}]] --> Just like the Exposure Action Value or Action Value for noise, safety administrations across the world are publishing values for vibrations. As of right now, The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not officially published a list of appropriate, time-weighted EAV guidelines for employers to follow. However, companies in the United States are encouraged by the [[NIOSH|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to follow the vibration limits set up by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|ACGIH]], which publishes a ''Threshold Limit Value'' or ''TLV'' in their annual book of TLVs and BEIs. The goal is for employers to have these numbers in order to make a conscious effort to lower the amount of harmful exposure absorbed by their workers. Since the link from physical vibration to damage caused by [[Raynaud's disease|Reynaud’s Phenomenon]] is less clearly defined between the EAV for noise and noise-induced hearing loss, an upper extreme limit ''Exposure Limit Value'' or ''ELV'' is provided as well to give a margin. ==See also== *[[Hearing impairment]] *[[Audiometry]] *[[Hearing Conservation Program]] *[[Noise-induced hearing loss]] == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9735&p_table=STANDARDS OSHA Occupational Noise Exposure Regulation 1910.95] * [http://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-sound-vibration/ NIOSH Power Tools Sound Power and Vibrations Database] [[Category:Occupational safety and health]] [[Category:Industrial hygiene]] [[Category:Safety engineering]] [[Category:Hearing]] [[Category:Protective gear]] [[Category:Noise reduction]] [[Category:Health standards]] [[Category:Industry]] [[Category:Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12883</id> <title>Expr</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=expr}} '''expr''' is a [[command line interface|command line]] [[Unix]] utility which evaluates an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] and outputs the corresponding value. Syntax: expr ''(expression)'' ''expr'' evaluates [[integer]] or [[String (computer science)|string]] expressions, including pattern matching [[regular expression]]s. Most of the challenge posed in writing expressions is preventing the command line shell from acting on characters intended for ''expr'' to process. The operators available * for integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus * for strings: find substring, find regular expression, find a set of characters in a string, length of string * for either: comparison (equal, not equal, less than, etc.) Also, [[Boolean logic|boolean]] expressions involving ''and'' and ''or'', such as expr length "abcdef" "<" 5 "|" 15 - 4 ">" 8 outputs "1". This is because length "abcdef" is 6, which is not less than 5 (so the left side of the | returns zero). But 15 minus 4 is 11 and is greater than 8, so the right side is true, which makes the ''or'' true, so 1 is the result. The program exit status is zero for this example. For pure arithmetic, it may be more convenient to use [[Bc_programming_language|bc]], e.g. echo "3*4+14/2" | bc since it accepts the expression as a single argument. == External links == *{{man|cu|expr|SUS|evaluate arguments as an expression}} *[http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man1/expr.1.php The program's manpage] *[http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/expr-invocation.html#expr-invocation expr invocation in GNU coreutils manual] {{Unix commands}} {{unix-stub}} [[Category:GNU Project software]] [[Category:Unix programming tools]] [[Category:Standard Unix programs]] [[Category:Unix SUS2008 utilities]] [[de:Expr]] [[el:Expr]] [[fr:Expr]] [[pl:Expr (Unix)]] [[pt:Expr]] [[ro:Expr]] [[ru:Expr]] [[vi:Expr]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12890</id> <title>Expression index</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|context =October 2009|unreferenced =January 2007|orphan =January 2007}} An '''expression index''' is a [[Relational database management system|database]] [[Index (database)|index]] that is built on a generic expression, rather than on a list of [[Column(database)|column]]s. This allows indexes to be defined for common query conditions that depend on data in a table, but are not actually stored in that table. A common use for an expression index is to support case-insensitive searching or constraints. For example, if a web site wants to make user names case-insensitive, but still preserve the case as originally entered by the user, a [[unique index]] can be created on the upper- or lower-case representation of the user name: :<code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX site_user__user_name_lower ON site_user( lower( user_name ) );</code> That will create a unique index on "lower(user_name)". Any queries that search on "lower(user_name)" could then make use of that index: :<code>SELECT user_id FROM site_user WHERE lower(user_name) = lower('Decibel');</code> [[Category:Database management systems]] [[Category:PostgreSQL]] [[ja:式インデックス]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12893</id> <title>Expressive power</title> <text>In [[computer
