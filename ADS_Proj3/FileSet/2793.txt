fire control solution. While these fire control systems greatly improved the long-range accuracy of ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore gunfire, especially on [[heavy cruiser]]s and battleships, it was in the [[anti-aircraft warfare]] mode that the Mark 1 made the greatest contribution. However, the anti-aircraft value of analog computers such as the Mark 1 was greatly reduced with the introduction of [[jet aircraft]], where the [[relative motion]] of the target became such that the computer's mechanism could not react quickly enough to produce accurate results. The design of the post war Mark 1A may have been influenced by the Bell Labs [[Mark 8, Fire Control Computer]] which was developed as an all electrical computer, incorporating technology from the M9 [[gun data computer]] as a safeguard to ensure adequate supplies of fire control computers for the USN during WW2. Surviving Mark 1 computers were upgraded to the Mark 1A standard after World war Two ended. Digital fire control computers were not introduced until the age of minicomputers in the mid-1970s. {{-}} ==See also== *[[Ship gun fire-control system]] *[[Admiralty Fire Control Table]] *[[High Angle Control System]] *[[Gun data computer]] ==External links== * [http://www.hnsa.org/doc/firecontrol/index.htm Fire Control Fundamentals] * [http://www.hnsa.org/doc/computermk1/index.htm Manual for the Mark 1 and Mark 1a Computer] * [http://www.hnsa.org/doc/computermk1-maint-vol1/index.htm Maintenance Manual for the Mark 1 Computer] * [http://www.hnsa.org/doc/stablemk6/index.htm Manual for the Mark 6 Stable Element] [[Category:Military computers]] [[pl:Mark I Fire Control Computer]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23518</id> <title>Mark Stephen Meadows</title> <text>{{Infobox person | name = Mark Stephen Meadows | nationality = American | other_names = pighed | known_for = Crutch<br />I, Avatar | awards = [[Ars Electronica Golden Nica]]: | website = http://www.markmeadows.com }} '''Mark Stephen Meadows''' is an American author and artist.
