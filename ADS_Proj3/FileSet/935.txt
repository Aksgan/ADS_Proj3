what the system needs to do next, the information provided by the Feedback needs to be a true representation of the present conditions. If the feedback information is sampled by the Control element too often, it can put unnecessary demands on the system. If the information is not read often enough, considerable error can occur resulting in system failure. The solution to this dilemma is to sample when needed, at a rate that allows us to have confidence that we can still maintain control over the system.<ref name="sampleFeedback">Martin Gardner, Phaselock Techniques, (New Jersey: [[John Wiley & Sons|John Wiley and Sons]]), Pages 285-287</ref> Going back to our auto. The rate we sample the street signs for information is going to be different than when we look at the speedometer. We may also change our [[sampling rate]] when certain outside influences introduce themselves into the feedback mix. If we have a police car behind us, odds are that we will be sampling the speedometer much more often than if a police car was not there. == Creating the control loop diagram using the CFA Loop == The Control Loop Diagram is a chart that provides a list of each of the conditions we discover during the analysis of the interaction of the specific item in question. A basic Control Loop Diagram is shown in Table 1. {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- ! Control Element Conditions ! Feedback Element Conditions ! Abort Element Conditions |- | Control Element Name | Feedback Element Name | Abort Element Name |- | Numbered list | Numbered list | Numbered list |} Table 1 – Control Loop Diagram Template The Control Loop Diagram provides a vehicle for the CFA Loop to be used effectively. The following is a sequence that allows for us to create the CFA Loop analysis information and convert it into a Control Loop Diagram. The process is: A. Identify the perspective of the CFA Loop. :It is important to know what the perspective is. We may be looking at the environment from a specific perspective (i.e. from the viewpoint of a Test Manager looking at defects or a Development Manager looking at versions.) The perspective will determine what is to be the Control and what is providing the Feedback for the analysis. B. Identify what is controlling the environment. C. Identify the Feedback components. :By identifying the controlling environment and the feedback elements, we can identify the parameters of the primary path. D. Identify the conditions that would lead to an abort of the primary path. :The abort conditions can give us an insight into the limitations and boundaries the primary path must operate within. E. Identify the processes the Control will use to manage the environment. :The interaction between the control and feedback elements can now be analyzed and the resulting information can be mapped into the Control Loop Diagram. F. Identify the processes used when the Abort is given control. An Example of the CFA Loop – Control loop diagram relationship The following CFA Loop and Control Loop Diagram exhibit the relationship between a Version Control/Defect Reporting CFA Loop (Figure 8) and its associated Control Loop Diagram (Table 2). [[File:CFALOOP9 Fig8.jpg]] Figure 8 – CFA Loop for Version Control/Defect Reporting A Control Loop Diagram for the CFA Loop with a focus on Version Control as the Control element (see Table 2) should look similar to the following table (mapped during an analysis brainstorming session): {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- ! Control Element Conditions ! Feedback Element Conditions ! Abort Element Conditions |- | Version Control (A) | Defect Reporting (B) | Issues Management (C) |- | 1. Version must match the incremental sub-version number expected to fix the next set of defects | 1. Defects reported back by critical levels | 1. Defects that cannot be fixed within a predefined time must be escalated |- | 2. Defects that are fixed, tested and passed cause the sub-version count to be incremented | 2. Critical defect count | 2. Defects violating the critical defect count or the age limits on critical defects will automatically create an Abort |- | 3. Defects not above a predefined count | | |} Table 2 – Control Loop Diagram == Control charts == Control Charts have a very close relationship to the CFA Loop. Control Charts are used to provide a means of tracking the trend and condition of a specific measured item. The [[Control chart|Control Chart]] (see Figure 9) uses the standard deviation of sampled items to determine whether the item is in-bounds (within acceptable conditions) or out of bounds (outside of acceptable conditions). The +3s is also identified as the Upper Defined-Control Limit or UDL. The -3s is also known as the Lower Defined-Control Limit or LDL. [[File:Control Chart1 Fig9.jpg]] Figure 9 – Control Chart Limits Those items that are in bounds are considered to be in control (see Figure 10). They can be the Control element of the CFA Loop. [[File:Control Chart2 Fig10.jpg]] Figure 10 – Control Chart In-Bounds Area Those items that are out of bounds are said to be out of control (see Figure 11). The out of bounds areas can also be identified as the Abort element of the CFA Loop. [[File:Control Chart3 Fig11.jpg]] Figure 11 – Control Chart Out-Of-Bounds Area Remember that it was mentioned earlier in this document that the CFA Loop and the Control Chart share the similar functions, the difference is in the use and objectives. We have already seen the Control and Abort similarities. Let’s look at a Control Chart (see Figure 12) and compare the information in the Control Chart with the CFA Loop elements. [[File:Control Chart4 Fig12.jpg]] Figure 12 – Control Chart Showing Use The ‘in bounds’ area is our Control element. As long as our [[data point]]s, sometimes called items, are within the ‘in bounds’ area, we are said to be in control. The data points are the Feedback element. The ‘out of bounds’ areas are the Abort elements. Notice that data point 4
