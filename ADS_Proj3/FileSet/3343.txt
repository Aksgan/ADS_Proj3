form of IT projects. As valuable as the result of the dialogue may be in terms of aligned plans, is the organizational learning that takes place through the dialogue, choices, and translation of the Operating Model into [[Enterprise Architecture]] and [[IT Governance]] that guide and control IT investment over time. ==Industry Standard Operating Models== * [[eTOM]] ([[Enhanced Telecom Operations Map]]) * IAA ([[Insurance Application Architecture]]) * [[IFW]] (Information Framework) * ITIL ([[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]]) * COBIT ([[Control Objectives for Information and related Technology]]) * O<sup>MM</sup>F ([http://www.operatingmodel.com Operating Model Maturity Framework]) ] ==See also== * [[Business model|Business Model]] * [[Capability Management in Business]] * [[Enterprise architecture|Enterprise Architecture]] * [[Governance, risk management, and compliance|Risk and Compliance]] * [[Shared services|Shared Services]] ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Operating Model}} [[Category:Enterprise architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27606</id> <title>Operating system advocacy</title> <text>'''Operating system advocacy''' is the practice of attempting to increase the awareness and improve the perception of a [[computer]] [[operating system]]. The motivation behind this may be to increase the number of users of a system, to assert the superiority of one choice over another or out of [[brand loyalty]], pride in an operating system's abilities, or to persuade software vendors to [[porting|port]] specific applications or device drivers to the platform. Operating system advocacy can vary widely in tone and form, from published comparisons to heated debates on [[mailing list]]s and other [[Internet forum|forums]]. In its most extreme forms it can veer into zealotry. Advocates are often normal users who devote their spare time to advocacy of their operating system of choice; many have a deep and abiding interest in the use, design and construction of operating systems and an emotional investment in their favourite operating system. Operating system advocacy can be compared to advocacy in other fields, particularly [[browser wars|browser]] and [[editor war]]s, but also advocacy of [[programming language]]s and [[video game console]]s. ==Usenet and other advocacy forums== Due to the often emotional nature of advocacy debate and its sometimes narrow appeal to the wider user population, forums for discussion of advocacy are often separate from those for general discussion. For example, the comp.os.ms-windows [[Usenet]] hierarchy has a group reserved solely for advocacyâ€”the ''Guide to the Windows newsgroups'' exhorts Usenet posters not to "get involved in arguments about Windows vs. OS/2 vs. Macintosh vs. NeXTSTEP ''except'' in the comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy group."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.saigon.com/cbmsw/wnewsfaq.html | title= Guide to the Windows newsgroups | author= Tom Haapanen and Sean Graham | work= | accessdate = 2005-09-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051024083232/http://www.saigon.com/cbmsw/wnewsfaq.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2005-10-24}}</ref> Operating system advocacy discussions, on Usenet and elsewhere, have spawned a variety of [[jargon]] describing commonly seen behaviour, including "MicroDroid"<ref>[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/MicroDroid.html MicroDroid<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and "Amiga Persecution Complex".<ref>[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/Amiga-Persecution-Complex.html Amiga Persecution Complex<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The emotional form and negative characteristics often associated with operating system advocacy have led some to create guidelines explaining what they consider to be positive advocacy, such as the ''Linux Advocacy Guidelines''<ref>[http://linuxgazette.net/issue14/advocate.html Linux Gazette, issue 14]</ref> and the ''Guidelines for Effective OS/2 Advocacy''.<ref>[http://www.os2bbs.com/file_d/text/PSM951.HTM Guidelines for Effective OS/2 Advocacy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Advocacy and specific operating systems== <!-- Alphabetical order --> ===FreeBSD=== [[FreeBSD]] is served by a [[mailing list]] specifically for advocacy discussion. Advocacy-related materials and links are provided on the FreeBSD [[website]], including a page of [[logo]]s. ===Linux=== As there are a large number of [[Linux distribution]]s, there are many organizations involved in [[Linux]] advocacy, including companies directly involved in the development of distributions as well as purely advocacy-based groups, such as [[SEUL]]. Promotion takes on a wide variety of forms from [[Tux]] [[plush toy]]s to [[t-shirt]]s and [[poster]]s, and even to more unorthodox forms, such as body paints and video games. ===Macintosh OS=== {{see also|Apple evangelist}} From the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl advertisement]] and "Test Drive a Macintosh" to the [[Apple Switch ad campaign|Apple Switch]] and [[Get a Mac]] advertising campaigns, [[Apple Computer]] has a long history of advocating its platform through innovative techniques in traditional media. This also covers advocacy of the [[Macintosh]] hardware, peripherals and even lifestyle choices, with both fans and the company projecting a [[hip (slang)|hip]] and trendy image while negatively portraying [[Microsoft Windows]], [[IBM]] or other competitors as anything from awkward and dated to a totalitarian [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] figure. ===Microsoft Windows=== {{expand section|date=November 2010}} [[Neowin.net]] wrote editorials opposing Windows bashing in the media.<ref>[http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&id=32934 Neowin.net - Why Vista Will Not Be The Last OS Microsoft Makes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Microsoft has attempted to boost popularity of Windows 7 with a launch party program. <ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.gottabemobile.com/2009/09/24/microsoft-getting-slammed-for-windows-7-launch-party-video/ |title = Microsoft Getting Slammed for Windows 7 Launch Party Video |accessdate = 02 Nov 2010 |author = Warner Crocker |publisher = [[GottaBeMobile]] }}</ref> ===NetBSD=== Like FreeBSD, the [[NetBSD]] Foundation hosts a [[mailing list]] especially for advocacy. This mailing list is automatically archived and made accessible online.<ref name="fn_1">The mailing list archives are [http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/ here]</ref> They also provide some official advocacy material, such as posters and flyers and an official "powered by" logo<ref name="fn_2">The advocacy page is [http://netbsd.org/gallery/advocacy/ here] and the logo [http://netbsd.org/gallery/logos.html#official-logo here].</ref> with a license permitting use on any product running NetBSD. ===OpenBSD=== {{see also|OpenBSD#Distribution and marketing}} Like FreeBSD and NetBSD, the [[OpenBSD]] project provides a mailing list specifically intended for advocacy, advocacy@openbsd.org. It was created on July 21, 1998 for discussion of user groups, stickers, shirts and the promotion of OpenBSD's image and also to host all [[Flaming|flame-worthy]] discussions. As a part of its advocacy, the project also maintains a list of consulting firms and individual consultants around the world on its website<ref name="fn_3">[http://www.openbsd.org/support.html OpenBSD Support and Consulting<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and has produced a number of slogans, including "Free, Functional & Secure", "Secure by default", and "Power. Security. Flexibility." Each OpenBSD release features an original song<ref name="fn_4">[http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html OpenBSD release song lyrics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a variety of artwork.<ref name="fn_5">[http://www.openbsd.org/art1.html OpenBSD Art<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ===OS/2=== {{see also|Team OS/2}} [[OS/2]] is the only operating system which saw the creation of a semi-formal advocates organization. Named ''[[Team OS/2]]'', it was a [[grassroots]] organization conceived
