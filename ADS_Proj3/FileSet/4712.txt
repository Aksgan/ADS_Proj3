The Visualize-EG (project name Graffiti) was the basic graphics card in the era of HP's older B,C and J class workstations (e.g., the B132). Due to this, EG was the integrated (on the motherboard) display device, although it was also available in GSC and later [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] card form. EG is a descendant of HP's CRX family of graphics devices. Despite being entry level, and offering no hardware 3D features, EG had excellent 2D performance. Specifications (without optional memory upgrade) are: * Resolutions up to 1280 x 1024 at 75Hz. * 8-planes providing up to 256 simultaneously displayed colours chosen from a truecolor palette. * 2, 256 entry hardware colour maps. * [[HP Color recovery]] technology for simulated truecolor using only 8 planes. Optional memory can be used to provide one or the other of these benefits. * 1 - Extra resolution - up to 1600x1200 or 1200x1600 @ 75Hz. * 2 - 16 new planes, giving 24 in total: <!--the phrase before this isn't clear--> 16 of these become image planes with the other 8 used as moveable "overlay: planes. Another 2 hardware colormaps become available — giving 2 for the image planes and 2 for the overlay planes. The EG features an accelerated 2D graphics engine that is capable of: * BitBLT featuring boolean and arithmetic raster operations ([[rasterops]]) at performance up to 241 million pixels per second. * Filling - a very fast (up to 2.3 billion pixels per second) hardware fill allows filling of rectangular areas with solid color or stippled pattern. It is also possible to fill with bitmap patterns. * Vectors - the hardware can produce over 7 million 10-pixel X-Window system compliant vectors per second. * Trapezoids - hardware support for trapezoids means filled polygons can be created at a rate of 106 million pixels per second. * Window clip and offset - time consuming [[clipping]] and relative co-ordinate translation are provided for in hardware. * Hardware cursor - a 2-color 64x64 pixel '[[sprite (computer science)|sprite]]' is provided for presenting the cursor. The programming interface of the EG (and other [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] graphics devices) has been kept private to [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], although efforts to release them are underway. The documentation needs to be "scrubbed" to check and remove company confidential material. {{DEFAULTSORT:Visualize Eg}} [[Category:Video cards]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39592</id> <title>Visudo</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=visudo}} '''visudo''' is a [[unix]] command that allows editing of the [[sudo|''sudoers'']] file in a safe fashion, namely by preventing multiple simultaneous edits with [[Lock (computer science)|locks]], performing [[Sanity testing|sanity checks]], and checking for parse errors. The ''sudoers'' file allows listed users access to [[Execution (computers)|execute]] to a [[subset]] of commands while having the privileges of the [[root user]]. The command syntax is (using man visudo): '''visudo''' [-c] [-q] [-s] [-V] [-f sudoers]. The name of the file is not necessary (is implied) when using -s and -q. The -f is attached to the sudoers, unlike the other flags. So, to edit as root, type: '''visudo''' -f sudoers. According to the man page, the -f flag is used only if the file sudoers is in another location (redhat 5, it is in /etc.) ==External links== *[http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/man/visudo.html http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/man/visudo.html] [[Category:Unix text editors]] [[Category:System administration]] {{Compu-soft-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>39604</id> <title>Vladimir Shukhov</title> <text>[[File:Vladimir Grigoryevich Shukhov 1891.jpg|thumb|220px|Vladimir Grigorievich Shukhov]] '''Vladimir Grigoryevich Shukhov''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Григорьевич Шухов}}), ({{OldStyleDate|August 28|1853|August 16}} - February 2, 1939) was a [[Russia]]n [[engineer]]-[[polymath]], [[scientist]] and [[architect]] renowned for his pioneering works on new methods of analysis for [[structural engineering]] that led to breakthroughs in [[industrial design]] of world's first [[hyperboloid structure]]s <ref>{{cite web | title = Hyperboloid water tower | year = 2007 | publisher = Nicolas Janburg, ICS | work = International Database and Gallery of Structures | url = http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0037128 | accessdate = 2007-11-28}}</ref>, [[Thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]]<ref name="Nicolas Janburg, ICS">{{cite web | title = Rotunda of the Panrussian Exposition | year = 2007 | publisher = Nicolas Janburg, ICS | work = International Database and Gallery of Structures | url = http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000385 | accessdate = 2007-11-28}}</ref>, [[tensile structure]]s<ref
