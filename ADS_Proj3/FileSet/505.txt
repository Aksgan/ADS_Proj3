Thus, the copying of any dataset might be called a 'brain dump' if its contents could be colloquially referred to as a 'brain'. 4) In the IT industry, a 'brain dump', usually spelled as a compound word ''braindump'', refers to material that has been memorized, or captured electronically by means of a small device such as a [[PDA]] or [[cell phone]] with a built in [[camera]], from an IT certification and re-created to provide an almost exact replica of the exam, thus violating most but not all [[non-disclosure agreement]]s agreed to prior to the administration of an exam.<ref name="Exam security policy"> {{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Microsoft Certified Professional Exam Security Policy and Non-Disclosure Agreement | date= 2001-08-03 | publisher= Microsoft Corporation | url = http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcpexams/policies/nda.mspx | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-14 | language = }} </ref> Examinees are often encouraged to remove their personal items other than their identification prior to an exam.<ref name="PersonalProperty"> {{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Test Center Experience | date= | publisher= Thompson Prometric | url = http://www.prometric.com/APFAQ/Test+Center.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-14 | language = }} </ref> ==In certification exams== The phrase "brain dump" refers to confidential information relating to [[test (student assessment)|examination]]s which is obtained by examinees who memorize, then "dump" (record) the information after the examination. Brain dumps are also referenced to collections of exam items that have been stolen from [[High-stakes test|high-stakes certification exams]].<ref> {{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Certified Internet Web Professional: Exam Policies | date=2007-04-05 | publisher= [[Prosoft Learning]] | url = http://www.ciwcertified.com/exams/policies.asp | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-25 }} </ref> Brain dumps are most commonly found amongst IT certification exams mainly because the exams are expensive and difficult to pass, and the questions rarely change. These type of brain dumps are actual exam questions and answers that users will memorize prior to taking (or sitting for) an exam. Brain dumps of this sort often constitute cheating because the information acquired was generally taken from material that was meant to remain secure, or information [[copyright]]ed or registered as [[trade secret]]s. Many of the larger corporations, such as [[Microsoft]], have recently begun fighting back against the companies that mass-produce brain dumps. Some of the companies producing these brain dumps are up front about the nature of their products while others do not indicate that their test exams are actual exam questions. Because of this, IT certification test takers have to be wary of which exam preparation materials they use. ===Legal repercussions=== On August 8, 2006 Microsoft filed against three listed individuals and 4-20 John Does doing business as TestKing for [[copyright infringement]].

Brain mapping can be conceived as a higher form of [[neuroimaging]], producing brain images supplemented by the result of additional (imaging or non-imaging) data processing or analysis, such as maps projecting (measures of) behaviour onto brain regions (see [[fMRI]]). Brain Mapping techniques are constantly evolving, and rely on the development and refinement of image acquisition, representation, analysis, visualization and interpretation techniques. Functional and structural [[neuroimaging]] are at the core of the mapping aspect of Brain Mapping. ==History== In the late 1980s in the United States, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science was commissioned to establish a panel to investigate the value of integrating neuroscientific information across a variety of techniques.<ref>Constance M. Pechura, Joseph B. Martin (1991). ''Mapping the Brain and Its Functions: Integrating Enabling Technologies Into Neuroscience Research''. Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on a National Neural Circuitry Database.</ref> Of specific interest is using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]), electroencephalography ([[EEG]]), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and other non-invasive scanning techniques to map [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[perfusion]], function and [[phenotype]]s of the human brain. Both healthy and [[disease]]d brains may be mapped to study [[memory]], [[learning]], [[aging]], and [[drug]] effects in various populations such as people with [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[clinical depression]]. This led to the establishment of the [[Neuroinformatics|Human Brain Project]].<ref>Stephen H. Koslow and Michael F. Huerta
