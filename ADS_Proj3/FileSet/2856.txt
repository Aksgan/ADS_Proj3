resulting in images of the body. MRI uses three [[electromagnetic field]]s: a very strong (on the order of units of [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]) static magnetic field to polarize the hydrogen nuclei, called the static field; a weaker time-varying (on the order of 1 kHz) field(s) for spatial encoding, called the gradient field(s); and a weak [[radio-frequency]] ([[Radio frequency|RF]]) field for manipulation of the hydrogen nuclei to produce measurable signals, collected through an [[antenna (radio)|RF antenna]]. Like [[Computed tomography|CT]], MRI traditionally creates a two dimensional image of a thin "slice" of the body and is therefore considered a [[tomography|tomographic]] imaging technique. Modern MRI instruments are capable of producing images in the form of 3D blocks, which may be considered a generalisation of the single-slice, tomographic, concept. Unlike CT, MRI does not involve the use of [[ionizing radiation]] and is therefore not associated with the same health hazards. For example, because MRI has only been in use since the early 1980s, there are no known long-term effects of exposure to strong static fields (this is the subject of some debate; see 'Safety' in [[MRI]]) and therefore there is no limit to the number of scans to which an individual can be subjected, in contrast with [[X-ray]] and [[Computed tomography|CT]]. However, there are well-identified health risks associated with tissue heating from exposure to the RF field and the presence of implanted devices in the body, such as pace makers. These risks are strictly controlled as part of the design of the instrument and the scanning protocols used. Because CT and MRI are sensitive to different tissue properties, the appearance of the images obtained with the two techniques differ markedly. In CT, X-rays must be blocked by some form of dense tissue to create an image, so the image quality when looking at soft tissues will be poor. In MRI, while any nucleus with a net nuclear spin can be used, the proton of the hydrogen atom remains the most widely used, especially in the clinical setting, because it is so ubiquitous and returns a large signal. This nucleus, present in water molecules, allows the excellent soft-tissue contrast achievable with MRI. ===Nuclear medicine=== {{Main|Nuclear medicine}} Nuclear medicine encompasses both diagnostic imaging and treatment of disease, and may also be referred to as molecular medicine or molecular imaging & therapeutics <ref>[http://www.snm.org Society of Nuclear Medicine]</ref>. Nuclear medicine uses certain properties of isotopes and the energetic particles emitted from radioactive material to diagnose or treat various pathology. Different from the typical concept of anatomic radiology, nuclear medicine enables assessment of physiology. This function-based approach to medical evaluation has useful applications in most subspecialties, notably oncology, neurology, and cardiology. ''[[Gamma camera]]s'' are used in e.g. scintigraphy, SPECT and PET to detect regions of biologic activity that may be associated with disease. Relatively short lived [[isotope]], such as [[Iodine-123|<sup>123</sup>I]] is administered to the patient. Isotopes are often preferentially absorbed by biologically active tissue in the body, and can be used to identify tumors or [[fracture]] points in bone. Images are acquired after collimated photons are detected by a crystal that gives off a light signal, which is in turn amplified and converted into count data. * ''[[Scintigraphy]]'' ("scint") is a form of diagnostic test wherein [[radioisotope]]s are taken internally, for example intravenously or orally. Then, gamma cameras capture and form two-dimensional<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/scintigraphy thefreedictionary.com - scintigraphy] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers, 2007 by Saunders; Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. 2007; McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine, 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies</ref> images from the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceuticals. *''[[single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]]'' is a 3D tomographic technique that uses gamma camera data from many projections and can be reconstructed in different planes. A dual detector head gamma camera combined with a CT scanner, which provides localization of functional SPECT data, is termed a SPECT/CT camera, and has shown utility in advancing the field of molecular imaging. In most other medical imaging modalities, energy is passed through the body and the reaction or result is read by detectors. In SPECT imaging, the patient is injected with a radioisotope, most commonly Thallium 201TI, Technetium 99mTC, Iodine 123I, and Gallium 67Ga <ref name="Dhawan P 2003">Dhawan P, A. (2003). Medical Imaging Analysis. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Interscience Publication</ref> . The radioactive gamma rays are emitted through the body as the natural decaying process of these isotopes takes place. The emissions of the gamma rays are captured by detectors that surround the body. This essentially means that the human is now the source of the radioactivity, rather than the medical imaging devices such as X-Ray, CT, or Ultrasound. *''[[Positron emission tomography]]'' (PET) uses coincidence detection to image functional processes. Short-lived positron emitting isotope, such as [[Fluorine-18|<sup>18</sup>F]], is incorporated with an organic substance such as [[glucose]], creating F18-fluorodeoxyglucose, which can be used as a marker of metabolic utilization. Images of activity distribution throughout the body can show rapidly growing tissue, like tumor, metastasis, or infection. PET images can be viewed in comparison to [[computed tomography]] scans to determine an anatomic correlate. Modern scanners combine PET with a CT, or even MRI, to optimize the image reconstruction involved with positron imaging. This is performed on the same equipment without physically moving the patient off of the gantry. The resultant hybrid of functional and anatomic imaging information is a useful tool in non-invasive diagnosis and patient management. ====Photo acoustic imaging==== {{Main|Photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine}} Photoacoustic imaging is a recently developed hybrid biomedical imaging modality based on the photoacoustic effect. It combines the advantages of optical absorption contrast with ultrasonic spatial resolution for deep imaging in (optical) diffusive or quasi-diffusive regime. Recent studies have shown that photoacoustic imaging can be used in vivo for tumor angiogenesis monitoring, blood oxygenation mapping, functional brain imaging, and skin melanoma detection, etc. === Breast Thermography === {{Split section|date=March 2010}} Digital infrared imaging [[thermography]] is based on the principle that metabolic activity and vascular circulation in both pre-cancerous tissue and the area surrounding a developing breast cancer is almost always higher than
