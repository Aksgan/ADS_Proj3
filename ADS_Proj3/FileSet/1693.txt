In AD 9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by Varus were defeated by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Modern Germany, as far as the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]], thus remained outside the Roman Empire. By AD 100, the time of [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]) , occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, southern [[Bavaria]] and the western [[Rhineland]], however, were Roman provinces. The 3rd century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke through the Limes and the Danube frontier into Roman-controlled lands.<ref name="Cambridge ancient history">{{cite book | series= The Cambridge Ancient History | title = The crisis of empire, A.D. 193-337 | volume = 12 | page = 442 | isbn=0-521-30199-8 | first = Alan K. | last = Bowman | first2 = Peter | last2 = Garnsey | first3 = Averil | last3 = Cameron | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005}}</ref> ===Holy Roman Empire 962–1806=== {{Main|Holy Roman Empire}} {{See also|Medieval demography|Ostsiedlung}} [[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (169)pano.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], created around AD 1000]] On 25 December 800, [[Charlemagne]] founded the [[Carolingian Empire]], which was [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]]. The medieval empire resulted from the [[East Francia|eastern portion]] of this division and existed in varying forms from 962 until 1806. Its territory stretched from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south. Often referred to as the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (or the Old Empire), it was officially called the ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium Nationis Germanicæ'' (Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation) starting in 1448, to adjust the title to its then reduced territory.
