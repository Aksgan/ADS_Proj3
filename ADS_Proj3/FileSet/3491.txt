concrete determinations of our empirical ego, to be able to turn to the field of pure consciousness, Heidegger claims that "the possibilities and destinies of philosophy are bound up with man's existence, and thus with temporality and with historicality."<ref name="heideproblems"/> However, ontological being and existential being are different categories, so Heidegger's conflation of these categories is, according to Husserl's view, the root of Heidegger's error. Husserl charged Heidegger with raising the question of ontology but failing to answer it, instead switching the topic to the Dasein, the only being for whom Being is an issue. That is neither ontology nor phenomenology, according to Husserl, but merely abstract anthropology. To clarify, perhaps, by abstract anthropology, as a non-existentialist searching for essences, Husserl rejected the existentialism implicit in Heidegger's distinction between being (sein) as things in reality and Being (Da-sein) as the encounter with being, as when being becomes present to us, that is, is unconcealed.<ref>I have attempted to respond to the request for clarification of Heidegger's distinction between being and Being.

Heidegger himself had contacts with some leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]], [[Kuki Shūzō]] and [[Kiyoshi Miki]].</ref> Furthermore, it has been claimed that a number of elements within phenomenology (mainly Heidegger's thought) have some resonance with Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly with [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].<ref>An account given by Paul Hsao (in ''Heidegger and Asian Thought'') records a remark by Chang Chung-Yuan claiming that "Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought"</ref> According to [[Tomonubu Imamichi]], the concept of ''Dasein'' was inspired &mdash; although Heidegger remains silent on this &mdash; by [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das-in-der-Welt-sein'' (being in the world) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' to describe [[Zhuangzi]]'s philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having studied with him the year before.<ref name=Imamichi>[[Tomonubu Imamichi]], ''In Search of Wisdom.

This initiative has been initiated by the Polish phenomenologist [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], editor of ''Analecta Husserliana''.</ref> In addition, the work of Jim Ruddy in the field of comparative philosophy, combined the concept of Transcendental Ego in Husserl's phenomenology with the concept of the primacy of self-consciousness in the work of Sankaracharya. In the course of this work, Ruddy uncovered a wholly new eidetic phenomenological science which he called "convergent phenomenology." This new phenomenology takes over where Husserl left off, and deals with the constitution of relation-like, rather than merely thing-like, or "intentional" objectivity.<ref>See the thesis, "Convergent Phenomenology," presented to the University of Madras, June, 1979.</ref> ==Historical overview of the use of the term== Phenomenology has at least three main meanings in [[philosophical]] history: one in the writings of [[G.W.F. Hegel]], another in the writings of [[Edmund Husserl]] in 1920, and a third, deriving from Husserl's work, in the writings of his former research assistant [[Martin Heidegger]] in 1927. *For [[G.W.F. Hegel]], phenomenology is an approach to [[philosophy]] that begins with an exploration of [[phenomena]] (what presents itself to us in conscious experience) as a means to finally grasp the absolute, logical, ontological and metaphysical Spirit that is behind phenomena. This has been called a "''dialectical phenomenology''". *For [[Edmund Husserl]], phenomenology is "the reflective study of the [[essence]] of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view."<ref>{{citation |first=David Woodruff |last=Smith |title=Husserl |publisher=Routledge |place= London-New York |year=2007 }}</ref> Phenomenology takes the intuitive experience of [[phenomena]] (what presents itself to us in phenomenological reflexion) as its starting point and tries to extract from it the essential features of experiences and the [[essence]] of what we experience. When generalized to the essential features of any possible experience, this has been called "''transcendental phenomenology''". [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] view was based on aspects of the work of [[Franz Brentano]] and was developed further by philosophers such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Max Scheler]], [[Edith Stein]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. *[[Martin Heidegger]] believed that [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] approach overlooked basic structural features of both the subject and object of experience (what he called their "being"), and expanded phenomenological enquiry to encompass our understanding and experience of Being itself, thus making phenomenology the method (in the first phase of his career at least) of the study of being, [[ontology]]. The difference in approach between [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and Heidegger influenced the development of [[existential phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]] in [[France]], as is seen in the work of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. [[Munich phenomenology|Munich phenomenologists]] (Johannes Daubert, [[Adolf Reinach]], [[Alexander Pfänder]] in [[Germany]] and [[Alfred Schütz]] in Austria), and [[Paul Ricoeur]] have all been influenced.
