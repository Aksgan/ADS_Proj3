short, concise text, as being written by the most intelligent authors. By contrast, those who needlessly used excessively long words or complex [[font]] types were perceived to be less intelligent. For example, the author of "The principal educational aspiration I have established for myself is to utilize my capabilities to the fullest" was rated as less intelligent than the author of the slightly more concise: "The primary academic goal I have set for myself is to use my potential to the fullest".<ref>Oppenheimer, D.

She joined the FORTRAN team, which was led by [[John Backus]], upon graduation from [[Vassar College]]. She was the only female member of the team.<ref>Steve Lohr. "John W. Backus, 82, Fortran Developer, Dies". ''New York Times''. March 20th, 2007.</ref> "They took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills-bridge players, chess players, even women."-Lois Haibt, After graduating from Vassar, where she did well in math and science, Lois Haibt was lured to I.B.M. by a starting salary of $5,100, nearly twice the offer from Bell Laboratories. "They told me it was a job programming computers," she said. "I only had a vague idea what that was. But I figured it must be something interesting and challenging, if they were going to pay me all that money." “It was the kind of atmosphere where if you couldn’t see what was wrong with your program, you would just turn to the next person,” she recalled. “No one was worried about seeming stupid or possessive of his or her code. We were all just learning together.” Lois Haibt was tasked with writing the computer module that analyzed the flow control from the part of the compiler that collected information about the program to be compiled and calculated (using [[Monte Carlo]] simulations) the frequency with which the basic blocks of the program would be executed. She was married to [[Luther H. Haibt]] and lived in [[Katonah, N.Y]] where she had a daughter Carolyn Mitchell. She worked for years as a systems analyst and researcher for [[Yorktown Heights IBM Research Laboratory]], where her work included working on visualization of program structure using a program she developed to draw multilevel flow charts and in later years, she worked in the analysis of [[Petri Nets]] and generating programs from them. ==See also== *[[Fortran]] *[[John Backus]] *[[List of prominent pioneers in computer science]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[http://computer-refuge.org/bitsavers/pdf/ibm/704/FORTRAN_paper_1957.pdf Original Paper on FORTRAN from 1957]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Haibt, Lois}} [[Category:American computer programmers]] [[Category:Computer pioneers]] [[Category:Fortran]] [[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Vassar College alumni]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22598</id> <title>LonTalk</title> <text>{{Distinguish|LocalTalk}} '''LonTalk''' is a protocol optimized for control created by [[Echelon Corporation]] for networking devices over media such as [[twisted pair]], [[powerline]]s, [[fiber optics]], and [[radio frequency|RF]]. It is popular for the automation of various functions in industrial control, [[home automation]], transportation, and buildings systems such as [[lighting]] and [[HVAC]]; see [[Intelligent building]]. LonTalk is part of the technology platform called [[LonWorks]]. LonTalk is defined by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Standard ANSI/CEA 709.1.
