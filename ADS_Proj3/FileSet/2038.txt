used only for diagnostics or for installing an operating system on a new computer. ====Emergency pull switch==== The ''Emergency pull switch''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} (Emergency power off, EPO) sends an EPO signal to every I/O channel, then turns off power to the processor complex. Because EPO bypasses the normal sequencing of power down, damage can result, and the EPO control has a mechanical latch to ensure that a customer engineer inspects the equipment before attempting to power it back on. ====Power on==== ''Power on''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} powers up all components of the processor complex and performs a system reset. ====Power off==== ''Power off''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} initiates an orderly power-off sequence. Although the contents of storage are preserved, the associated storage keys may be lost. ====Interrupt==== The ''Interrupt'' key<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} causes an [[#External interrupt|external interrupt]] with bit 25 set in the External Old PSW. ====Wait light==== The ''Wait light''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} indicates that the [[#Program Status Word (PSW)|PSW]] has bit 14 (wait) set; the processor is temporarily halted but resumes operation when an interrupt condition occurs. ====Manual light==== The ''Manual light''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} indicates that the CPU is in a stopped state. ====System light==== The ''System light''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} indicates that a meter is running, either due to CPU activity or due to I/O channel activity. ====Test light==== The ''Test light''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} test light indicates that certain operator controls are active, when certain facilities, e.g., INSTRUCTION STEP, have been used by a Diagnose instruction or when abnormal thermal conditions exist. The details are model dependent. ====Load light==== The ''Load light''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=124}} is turned on by IPL and external start. It is turned off by loading the PSW from location 0 at the completion of the load process. ====Load unit==== The ''Load unit''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|pages=124-125}} controls provide the rightmost 11<ref group=NB>There is an inconsistency, in that <sup class=reference>''Interruptions from More than Seven Channels''[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=121.4}} allows for more channels.</ref> bits of the device from which to perform an IPL. ====Load Key==== The ''Load Key''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=125}} start the [[#Initial Program Load|IPL]] sequence. ====Prefix Select Key Switch==== The ''Prefix Select Key Switch''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=125}} selects whether [[#Initial Program Load|IPL]] will used the primary prefix or the alternat prefix. ====System-Reset Key==== The ''System-Reset Key''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=125}} initiates a [[#System Reset|System Reset]]. ====Stop Key==== The ''Stop Key''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=125}} puts the CPU in a stopped state; channel programs continue running and interrupt conditions remain pending. ====Rate Switch==== The ''Rate Switch''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=125}} determines the mode in which the processor fetches instructions. Two modes are defined by the architecture: *PROCESS *INSTRUCTION STEP ====Start Key==== The ''Start Key''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=125}} initiates instruction fetching in accordance with the setting of the [[#Rate Switch|Rate Switch]]. ====Storage-Select Switch==== The ''Storage-Select Switch''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} determines the type of resource accessed by the [[#Store Key|Store Key]] and [[#Display Key|Display Key]]. Three selections are defined by the architecture: *Main storage *General registers *floating-point registers ====Address Switches==== The ''Address Switches''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} specify the address or register number for the [[#Store Key|Store Key]], [[#Display Key|Display Key]] and, on some models, the [[#Set IC Key|Set IC Key]].. ====Data Switches==== The ''Data Switches''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} specify the data for the [[#Store Key|Store Key]] and, on some models, the [[#Set IC Key|Set IC Key]]. ====Store Key==== The ''Store Key''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} stores the value in the [[#Data Switches|Data Switches]] as specified by the [[#|Storage-Select Switch]] and the [[#Address Switches|Address Switches]]. ====Display Key==== The ''Display Key''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} displays the value specified by the [[#|Storage-Select Switch]] and the [[#Address Switches|Address Switches]]. ====Set IC Key==== The ''Set IC=''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} sets the instruction address portion of the PSW from the [[#Data Switches|Data Switches]] or the [[#Address Switches|Address Switches]], depending on the model. ====Address-Compare Switches==== The ''Address-Compare Switches''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} select the mode of comparison and what is compared. Stop on instruction address compare is present on all models, but stop on data address compare is only present on some models. ====Alternate-Prefix Light==== The ''Alternate-Prefix Ligh''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=126}} is on when the prefix trigger is in the alternate state. ===Optional features=== ====Byte-aligned operands==== On some models the alignment requirements for some problem-state instructions were relaxed. There is no mechanism to turn off this feature, and programs depending on receiving a program check type 6 (alignment) on those instructions must be modified. ====Decimal arithmetic==== The decimal arithmetic feature provides instructions that operate on packed decimal data. A packed decimal number has 1-31 decimal digits followed by a 4-bit sign. All of the decimal arithmetic instructions except PACK and UNPACK generate a Data exception if a digit is not in the range 0-9 or a sign is not in the range A-F. ====Direct Control==== The ''Direct Control''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|page=17.1}} feature provides six external signal lines and an 8-bit data path to/from storage.<ref name=A22-6845/> ====Floating-point arithmetic==== The floating-point arithmetic feature provides 4 64-bit floating point registers and instructions to operate on 32 and 64 bit hexadecimal floating point numbers. The 360/85 and 360/195 also support 128 bit extended precision floating point numbers. ====Interval timer==== If the interval timer feature<ref name=A22-6821-7/>{{rp|page=17.1}} is installed, the processor decrements the word at location 80 ('50'X) at regular intervals; the architecture does not specify the interval but does require that value subtracted make it appear as though 1 were subtracted from bit 23 300 times per second. The smaller models decremented at the same frequency (50 Hz or 60 Hz) as the AC power supply, but larger models had a high resolution timer feature. The processor casues an External interrupt when the timer goes to zero. ====Multi-system operation==== ''Multi-system operation''<sup class=reference>[[#PoOps|PoOps]]</sup>{{rp|pages=17.1-18}} is a set of features to support multi-processor systems, e.g., [[#Direct Control|Direct Control]], direct address relocation (prefixing). ====Storage protection==== If the storage protection feature<ref name=A22-6821-7/>{{rp|pages=17-17.1}} is installed, then there is a 4-bit storage key associated with every 2,048-byte block of storage and that key is checked when storing into any address in that block by either a CPU or an I/O channel. A CPU or channel key of 0 disables the check; a nonzero CPU or channel key allows data to be stored only in a block with the matching key. Storage Protection was used to prevent a defective application from writing
