Domino began life as '''Lotus Notes Server''', the server component of [[Lotus Software|Lotus Development Corporation]]'s client-server messaging technology. It can be used as an application server for [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]] applications and/or as a web server. It also has a built-in database system in the format of NSF.

The data is stored as documents and views allow finding specific documents efficiently. The [http://www.almaden.ibm.com/u/mohan/domino_sigmod99.pdf document oriented database] is a core part of the [http://www-12.lotus.com/ldd/doc/uafiles.nsf/docs/inside-notes/$File/insidenotes.pdf Domino architecture]. ===Documents=== Documents have unique ids and further built in fields like the last author, last modified date, etc. and allow custom application specific fields. Documents can contain rich text which can be formatted text and images (MIME) or full file attachments. Documents can be queried via [[APIs]] and views. Lotus Domino also supports full text search for a full database as built in feature. ==Replication== Lotus Notes uses passive [[Replication (computer science)|replication]] to maintain consistent data on various '''replicas''' of a database across servers and clients. ==Security== Lotus Domino servers and databases have multiple levels at which security is applied, from server access to individual databases and documents, parts of documents or actions within those databases. == Lotus Domino products == * Lotus Domino ** Collaboration Express ** Enterprise Server ** Messaging Express ** Messaging Server ** Utility Express ** Utility Server * Lotus Domino Access for [[Microsoft Outlook]] * Lotus Domino Administrator Client * Lotus Domino Designer Client * Lotus Domino Document Manager (formerly Domino.Doc) * Lotus Domino Everyplace * [[IBM Lotus iNotes]] (IBM Lotus Domino Web Access before 2008) ** Lite Mode (for slow connections, available since 8.0.1) ** Ultralite Mode (for Safari browser on Apple iPhone, available since 8.0.2) * Lotus Domino Unified Communications * [[IBM Lotus Notes Traveler|Lotus Notes Traveler]] == Lotus Domino services == The Lotus Domino server can provide multiple services.
