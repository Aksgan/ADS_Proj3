Note the size comparison with the cellular telephone at right.]] '''Radio-controlled helicopters''' (also ''[[Radio control|RC]] helicopters'') are [[model aircraft]] which are distinct from [[Radio controlled aircraft|RC airplanes]] because of the differences in construction, [[aerodynamics]], and flight training. Several basic designs of RC helicopters exist, of which some (such as those with [[collective pitch]], meaning blades which rotate on their longitudinal axis to vary or reverse lift) are more maneuverable than others. The more maneuverable designs are often harder to fly, but benefit from greater [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] capabilities. Flight controls allow pilots to control the collective and throttle (usually linked together), the cyclic controls ([[Pitch (flight)|pitch]] and [[roll (flight)|roll]]), and the tail rotor ([[yaw (flight)|yaw]]). Controlling these in unison enables the helicopter to perform most {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} of the same maneuvres as full-sized helicopters, such as hovering and backwards flight, and many that full-sized helicopters cannot. The various helicopter controls are effected by means of small [[RC Servo|servo]] motors, commonly known as servos. A [[Vibrating structure gyroscope|piezoelectric gyroscope]] is typically used on the tail rotor ([[yaw (flight)|yaw]]) control to counter wind- and torque-reaction-induced tail movement. This "gyro" does not itself apply a mechanical force, but electronically adjusts the control signal to the tail rotor servo. The engines typically used to be methanol-powered two-stroke motors, but electric [[brushless motor]]s combined with a high-performance [[lithium polymer battery]] are now more common and provide improved efficiency, performance and lifespan compared to brushed motors, while decreasing prices bring them within reach of hobbyists. Gasoline and jet turbine engines are also used. ==Types of R/C helicopters== Common power sources are nitro ([[nitromethane#Use as an engine fuel|nitromethane]]-[[methanol]] internal combustion), electric batteries, gas turbines, petrol and gasoline. Mechanical layouts include [[CCPM]] (cyclic/collective pitch mixing) in all power sources, fixed-pitch electric rotors and [[coaxial rotor|coaxial electric rotors]]. Practical electric helicopters are a recent development but have rapidly developed and become more common, overtaking nitro helicopters in common use. Gas-turbine helicopters are also increasing in popularity, although the high cost puts them out of reach of most people. ===Nitro (glow fuel)=== Nitro or [[glow fuel]] helicopters come in different sizes: 15, 30, 50, 60 and 90 size. These numbers originated from the size of engine used in the different models (0.30 cu in, 0.50 cu in and so on). The bigger and more powerful the engine, the larger the main rotor blade that it can turn and hence the bigger the aircraft overall. Typical flight times for nitro helicopters is 7–14 minutes depending on the engine size and tuning. ===Electric=== [[Image:TDR-Yellow2.JPG|right|thumb|The 252 km/h fast electric helicopter TDR]] Recent advancements in battery technology are making electric flying more feasible in terms of flying time. [[Lithium polymer]] (LiPo) batteries are able to provide the high current required for high performance aerobatics while still remaining very light. Typical flight times are 4–12 minutes depending on the flying style and battery capacity. In the past electric helicopters were used mainly indoors due to the small size and lack of fumes. Larger electric helicopters suitable for outdoor flight and advanced aerobatics have become a reality over the last few years and have become very popular. Their quietness has made them very popular for flying sites close to residential areas and in places such as [[Germany]] where there are strict noise restrictions. Nitro helicopters have also been converted to electric power by commercial and home made kits. The smallest remote-controlled production model helicopter made (Guinness World Records 2006) is the Picooz Extreme MX-1 sold at many toy stores (although this is infrared controlled, not radio), electronics stores and internet stores, costing about $30 (£28). The next smallest is the [[Picoo Z|standard Picooz]] helicopter. Several models are in contention for the title of the smallest non-production remote-controlled helicopter, including the [[Pixelito]] family of micro helicopters, the [[Proxflyer]] family, and the [[Micro flying robot]]. A recent innovation is that of '''[[coaxial rotors|coaxial]]''' electric helicopters. The system's inherent stability has, in recent years, made it a good candidate for the design of small models for beginner and/or indoor use. Models of this type, as in the case of a full-scale helicopter, eliminate rotational torque and extremely quick control response, both of which are very pronounced in a [[CCPM]] model. While a coaxial model is very stable and can be flown indoors even in tight quarters, such a helicopter has limited forward speed, especially outdoors. Most models are fixed-pitch, i.e. the [[collective pitch]] of the blades cannot be controlled, plus the cyclic control is only applied to the lower rotor. Compensating for even the slightest breeze causes the model to climb rather than to fly forward even with full application of [[Helicopter_pilotage#Cyclic|cyclic]]. More advanced coaxial constructions with two swashplates and/or pitch control - common for the big coaxial helicopters like [[Kamov]]s - have been realized as models in individual projects but have not
