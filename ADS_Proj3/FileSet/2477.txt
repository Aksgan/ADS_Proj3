for a passive scalar <math>\phi</math>, such as mixture fraction or temperature, can be written as :<math> \frac{ \partial \overline{\phi} }{ \partial t } + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \overline{u}_j \overline{\phi} \right) = \frac{\partial \overline{J_{\phi}} }{\partial x_j} + \frac{ \partial q_{ij} }{ \partial x_j } </math> where <math>J_{\phi}</math> is the diffusive flux of <math>\phi</math>, and <math>q_{ij}</math> is the sub-filter stress tensor for the scalar <math>\phi</math>. The filtered diffusive flux <math>\overline{J_{\phi}}</math> is unclosed, unless a particular form is assumed for it (e.g. a gradient diffusion model <math>J_{\phi} = D_{\phi} \frac{ \partial \phi }{ \partial x_i }</math>). <math>q_{ij}</math> is defined analogously to <math>\tau_{ij}^{r}</math>, :<math> q_{ij} = \bar{\phi} \overline{u}_j - \overline{\phi u_j} </math> and can similarly be split up into contributions from interactions between various scales. This sub-filter tensor also requires a sub-filter model. === Compressible governing equations === For the governing equations of compressible flow, each equation, starting with the conservation of mass, is filtered. This gives: :<math> \frac{\partial \overline{\rho}}{\partial t} + \frac{ \partial \overline{u_i \rho} }{\partial x_i} = 0 </math> which results in an additional sub-filter term. However, it is desirable to avoid having to model the sub-filter scales of the mass conservation equation. For this reason, Favre <ref name="Favre_1983">{{cite journal |author=Favre, Alexander |title=Turbulence: space-time statistical properties and behavior in supersonic flows |year=1983 |journal=Physics of Fluids A |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=2851–2863}}</ref> proposed a density-weighted filtering operation, called Favre filtering, defined for an arbitrary quantity <math>\phi</math> as: :<math> \tilde{\phi} = \frac{ \overline{\rho \phi} }{ \overline{\rho} } </math> which, in the limit of incompressibility, becomes the normal filtering operation. This makes the conservation of mass equation: :<math> \frac{\partial \overline{\rho}}{\partial t} + \frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tilde{u_i} }{ \partial x_i } = 0. </math> This concept can then be extended to write the Favre-filtered momentum equation for compressible flow. Following Vreman<ref name="Vreman_1995">{{cite journal |author1=Vreman, Bert |author2=Geurts, Bernard |author3=Kuerten, Hans |journal=[[Applied Scientific Research]] |year=1995 |volume=45 |issue=3 |doi=10.1007/BF00849116}}</ref>: :<math> \frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tilde{u_i} }{ \partial t } + \frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tilde{u_i} \tilde{u_j} }{ \partial x_j } + \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i } - \frac{ \partial \overline{\sigma_{ij}} }{ \partial x_j } = - \frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tau_{ij}^{r} }{ \partial x_j } + \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_j } \left( \overline{\sigma}_{ij} - \tilde{\sigma}_{ij} \right) </math> where <math>\sigma_{ij}</math> is the shear stress tensor, given for a Newtonian fluid by: :<math> \sigma_{ij} = 2 \mu(T) S_{ij} - \frac{2}{3} \mu(T) \delta_{ij} S_{kk} </math> and the term <math>\frac{ \partial }{\partial x_j} \left( \overline{\sigma}_{ij} - \tilde{\sigma}_{ij} \right)</math> represents a sub-filter viscous contribution from evaluating the viscosity <math>\mu(T)</math> using the Favre-filtered temperature <math>\tilde{T}</math>. The subgrid stress tensor for the Favre-filtered momentum field is given by :<math> \tau_{ij}^{r} = \overline{\rho} \left( \tilde{ u_i u_j } - \tilde{u_i} \tilde{u_j} \right). </math> By analogy, the Leonard decomposition may also be written for the residual stress tensor for a filtered triple product <math>\overline{\rho \phi \psi}</math>. The triple product can be rewritten using the Favre filtering operator as <math>\overline{\rho} \tilde{\phi \psi}</math>, which is an unclosed term (it requires knowledge of the fields <math>\phi</math> and <math>\psi</math>, when only the fields <math>\tilde{\phi}</math> and <math>\tilde{\psi}</math> are known). It can be broken up in a manner analogous to <math>\overline{u_i u_j}</math> above, which results in a sub-filter stress tensor <math>\overline{\rho} \left( \tilde{\phi \psi} - \tilde{\phi} \tilde{\psi} \right)</math>. This sub-filter term can be split up into contributions from three types of interactions: the Leondard tensor <math>L_{ij}</math>, representing interactions among resolved scales; the Clark tensor <math>C_{ij}</math>, representing interactions between resolved and unresolved scales; and the Reynolds tensor <math>R_{ij}</math>, which represents interactions among unresolved scales.<ref name="Sagaut_2009">{{cite book |author1=Garnier, E. |author2=Adams, N. |author3=Sagaut, P. |title=Large eddy simulation for compressible flows |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2818-1 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2819-8}}</ref> === Filtered kinetic energy equation === In addition to the filtered mass and momentum equations, filtering the kinetic energy equation can provide additional insight. The kinetic energy field can be filtered to yield the total filtered kinetic energy: :<math> \overline{E} = \frac{1}{2} \overline{ u_i u_i } </math> and the total filtered kinetic energy can be decomposed into two terms: the kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field <math>E_f</math>, :<math> E_f = \frac{1}{2} \overline{u_i} \cdot \overline{u_i} </math> and the residual kinetic energy <math>k_r</math>, :<math> k_r = \frac{1}{2} \overline{ u_i \cdot u_i } - \frac{1}{2} \overline{u_i} \cdot \overline{u_i} = \frac{1}{2} \tau_{ii}^{r} </math> such that <math>\overline{E} = E_f + k_r</math>. The conservation equation for <math>E_f</math> can be obtained by multiplying the filtered momentum transport equation by <math>\overline{u_i}</math> to yield: :<math> \frac{\partial E_f}{\partial t} + \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial E_f}{\partial x_j} - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i} \bar{p} }{ \partial x_i } - \frac{\partial \overline{u_j} \tau_{ij}^{r}}{\partial x_i} - 2 \nu \frac{ \partial \overline{u_i} \bar{S_{ij}} }{ \partial x_i } = - \epsilon_{f} - \Pi </math> where <math>\epsilon_{f} = 2 \nu \bar{S_{ij}} \bar{S_{ij}}</math> is the dissipation of kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field by viscous stress, and <math>\Pi = -\tau_{ij}^{r} \bar{S_{ij}}</math> represents the sub-filter scale (SFS) dissipation of kinetic energy. The terms on the left-hand side represent transport, and the terms on the right-hand side are sink terms that dissipate kinetic energy.<ref name="Pope_2000" /> The <math>\Pi</math> SFS dissipation term is of particular interest, since it represents the transfer of energy from large resolved scales to small unresolved scales. On average, <math>\Pi</math> transfers energy from large to small scales. However, instantaneously <math>\Pi</math> can be positive ''or'' negative, meaning it can also act as a source term for <math>E_f</math>, the kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field. The transfer of energy from unresolved to resolved scales is called '''backscatter''' (and likewise the transfer of energy from resolved to unresolved scales is called '''forward-scatter''').<ref name="Piomelli_1991">{{cite journal |author1=Piomelli, U. |author2=Cabot, W. |author3=[[Parviz Moin|Moin, P.]] |author4=Lee, S. |title=Subgrid-scale backscatter in turbulent and transitional flows |journal=Physics of Fluids A |year=1991 |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=1766–1771 |doi=10.1063/1.857956}}</ref> == Numerical Methods for LES == Large eddy simulation involves the solution to the discrete filtered governing equations using [[computational fluid dynamics]].
