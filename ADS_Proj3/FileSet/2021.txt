found there. Such lists are sometimes included by authors of [[regional biota]], partly to demonstrate that the authors have considered and rejected the taxa in question rather than overlooked them, and partly to encourage researchers and others to seek out the taxa in question so that they can be added to the list of the area's biota in future revisions. Taxa may be included for different reasons: * They may be resident close to the region in question, and the region may have habitat which appears suitable * They may be long-distance vagrants with a pattern of occurrence * They may be poorly-studied taxa, which the authors feel could be found in the region if appropriate search techniques are used * There may be historical evidence of occurrence which the authors felt was not watertight enough to justify inclusion in a definitive list for the region Ornithological works which have included hypothetical lists include the following: * ''[[A field guide to the birds of Hawaii and the Tropical Pacific]]'' by Pratt, Bruner and Berrett * ''[[Birds of South Asia.

The built-in [[BLOPEX]] package in addition allows solving [[eigenvalue]] problems. The main strength of '''Hypre''' is availability of high performance parallel [[multigrid]] [[preconditioning|preconditioners]] for both structured and unstructured grid problems, see (Falgout et. al., 2005, 2006). Currently, '''Hypre''' supports only [[real number|real]] [[double-precision]] arithmetic. '''Hypre''' uses the [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) standard for all message-passing communication. The current beta version of '''Hypre''' is 2.6.0b; released 2010/02/04. [[PETSc]] has an interface to call '''Hypre''' [[preconditioning|preconditioners]]. '''Hypre''' is being developed and is supported by members of the Scalable Linear Solvers project within the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. == Features == '''hypre''' provides the following features: * Parallel vectors and matrices, using several different interfaces * Scalable parallel [[preconditioning|preconditioners]] * Built-in [[BLOPEX]] ==References== {{Citation | last = Falgout | first = R.D. | author-link = | last2 = Jones | first2 = J.E. | author2-link = | last3 = Yang | first3 = U.M. | author3-link = | title = Pursuing scalability for hypreâ€™s conceptual interfaces | journal = ACM Trans.

The hardware, cheaply available, became popular among collectors who modified the appliance to run as a normal [[Personal Computer|PC]]. This made the [[Computer hardware|device]] capable of running [[Personal computer|PC]] [[operating system]]s, such as [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. The original retail price was $99. The actual cost of the device was roughly estimated between $300 and $400. The devices were sold as a [[loss leader]] for monthly Internet service. However, as soon as a [[Hack (technology)|hacking]] method became available on the Internet (in 2000), many customers canceled the monthly service, which eventually made the business model unsustainable. Similar [[business model]]s and failures were also seen with the [[3Com Audrey]] and [[Virgin Webplayer]]. ==Hacking== [[Image:2008-04-25 Netpliance i-Opener RAM modules.jpg|thumb|left|View of the RAM modules inside the i-Opener.]] Ken Segler, an [[engineer]] from [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], discovered that the i-Opener was simply an x86 compatible PC inside a
