calculate how many possibilites from ''S'' would be eliminated for each possible colored/white score. The score of the guess is the least of such values. Play the guess with the highest score ([[minimax]]). #Go back to step 2 until you have got it right. Subsequent mathematicians have been finding various algorithms that reduce the average number of turns needed to solve the pattern: in 1993, Mami Koyama and [[Tony W. Lai]] found a method that required an average of 4.340 turns to solve, with a worst case scenario of six turns.<ref>{{Citation | last = Koyama | first = Mami | last2 = Lai | first2 = Tony | title = An Optimal Mastermind Strategy | journal = Journal of Recreational Mathematics | issue = 25 | pages = 251–256 | year = 1993}}</ref> In December 2005, [[Jeff Stuckman]] and [[Guo-Qiang Zhang]] showed in an [[arXiv]] article that the Mastermind Satisfiability Problem is [[NP-complete]].<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0512049 Mastermind is NP-Complete] Retrieved 2010-09-02.</ref> ==Variations== Varying the number of colors and the number of holes results in a spectrum of Mastermind games of different levels of difficulty. Another common variation is to support different numbers of players taking on the roles of codemaker and codebreaker. The following are some examples of Mastermind games produced by [[Invicta Plastics|Invicta]], [[Parker Brothers]], [[Pressman Toy Corporation|Pressman]], [[Hasbro]], and other game manufacturers: {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- !

Computer and [[Online skill-based game|Internet versions]] of the game have also been made, sometimes with variations in the number and type of pieces involved and often under different names to avoid trademark infringement.

It was started as a [[proof-of-concept]] for Electric Classifieds which aimed to provide classified advertising systems for newspapers. Early on, Kremen was assisted by Peng T. Ong, who helped design the initial system, and Simon Glinsky, who helped develop one of the first Internet business plans for Match.com and provided management and marketing expertise. The initial business scope developed by this team included a possible subscription model, now common among personals services, and inclusion of diverse communities with high first trial and market leaders status, including women, technology professionals and the LGBT community. [[Fran Maier]] joined in late 1994 to lead the Match.com business unit where she significantly bolstered the strategy to make Match.com friendly and accessible to women (the
