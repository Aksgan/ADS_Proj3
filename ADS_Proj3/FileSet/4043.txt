Suffolk|Newmarket]], [[Saffron Walden]], [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] and [[Huntingdon]]. In February 2006, the [[Judge Business School]] reported estimates that suggested that at that time, there were around 250 active start-ups directly linked to the University, valued at around US$6 billion. Only a tiny proportion of these companies have so far grown into [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s: [[ARM Ltd|ARM]] and [[Autonomy Corporation]] are the most obvious examples, and more recently [[Cambridge Silicon Radio|CSR]] has seen rapid growth due to the uptake of [[Bluetooth]]. ==Area characteristics== The region has one of the most flexible job markets in the technology sector, and people are often employed by other companies after a start-up fails. Although everyone wants their company to succeed, failures are tolerated, indeed almost expected. One explanation for the area's success is that after a while such an employment market is self-sustaining, since employees are willing to move to an area that promises a future beyond any one company. Another factor is the high degree of 'networking', enabling people across the region to find partners, jobs, funding, and know-how. Organisations have sprung up to facilitate this process, for example the [[Cambridge Network]]. Another explanation is that Cambridge has the academic pre-eminence of [[Cambridge University]], a high [[standard of living]] available in the county, good transport links, and a relatively low incidence of social problems such as [[crime]] and [[hard and soft drugs|hard drug]] use. Many graduates from the university choose to stay on in the area, giving local companies a rich pool of talent to draw upon {{Fact|date=November 2008}}. The high-technology industry has little by way of competition, unlike say in [[Oxfordshire]] where plenty of other competing industries exist. Because Cambridgeshire was not until recently a high-technology centre, commercial rents were generally lower than in other parts of the UK, giving companies a head-start on those situated in other more expensive regions; this has, however, recently changed and Cambridgeshire now has one of the highest costs of living in the UK outside London.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} A downside is that lower-skilled workers may find it hard to find jobs, or to afford living costs. == See also == *[[Acorn Computers Ltd]] *[[Andy Hopper]] *[[Aveva]] *[[Cambridge Network]] *[[CamSemi]] *[[Camcon Technology]] *[[DANTE]] *[[Hermann Hauser]] *[[Jagex]] *[[List of places with 'Silicon' names]] *[[Oxford-Cambridge Arc]] *[[Sinclair Research Ltd]] *[[Sagentia]] *[[Silicon Glen]] *[[Silicon Valley]] == References == *''The Cambridge Cluster Report 2007'', Library House 2007, [http://www.gcp.uk.net/downloads/LHCC07.pdf Download] *''The Cambridge Phenomenon: The Growth of High Technology Industry in a University Town'', Segal Quince & Partners 1985, ISBN 0-9510202-0-X *''The Cambridge Phenomenon Revisited - a synopsis of the new report by Segal Quince Wicksteed'', Segal Quince & Partners 2000, [http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_4516 Download] *''The Cambridge Cluster Report 2003'', Library House 2003, [http://www.libraryhouse.net/www/publications/download.php?dl_id=8 Download] *''The Cambridge Cluster Report 2004'', Library House in association with Grant Thornton 2004, [http://www.libraryhouse.net/www/publications/download.php?dl_id=9 Download] *''The Cambridge Cluster Report 2006'', Library House 2006, [http://www.libraryhouse.net/www/publications/download.php?dl_id=20 Download] *''The Cambridge Technopole Report 2006'' An overview of the UK's leading high tech cluster, St John's Innovation Centre 2006, [http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/links/article/default.aspx?objid=31488] *''The Impact of the University of Cambridge on the UK Economy and Society'' A high-level study commissioned by EEDA and the Cambridge Network in 2006, [http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/links/article/default.aspx?objid=31489] == External links == *[http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/ Cambridge Corporate Gateway] *[http://www.cambridgetechnopole.org.uk/ Cambridge Technopole] {{Economy of the United Kingdom}} {{Science and technology in the United Kingdom}} [[Category:Economy of Cambridgeshire]]<!-- generally --> [[Category:Economy of Cambridge]]<!-- especially --> [[Category:High-technology business districts]] [[Category:Information technology places]] [[no:Silicon Fen]] [[fi:Silicon Fen]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34402</id> <title>Silicon Valley of India</title> <text>The '''Silicon Valley of India''' is a [[nickname]] of the [[India]]n city of [[Bangalore]]. The name signifies Bangalore's status as a hub for [[information technology]] (IT) companies in India and is a comparative reference to the original [[Silicon Valley]], based around [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[California]], a major hub for IT companies in the [[United States]]. One of earliest mentions of this [[sobriquet]] occurred in late 1980s in the ''[[Indian Express]]''.<ref name=indexpress>The Indian Express (Bangalore Edition). 6 November 1988</ref> The more prevalent application of the nickname Bangalore began in the 1990s<ref name=siliconvalley>Heitzman, James.

India-seminar.com. 2001</ref> based on a concentration of firms specialising in [[Research and Development]] (R&D), [[electronics]] and [[software]] production. ==History== The [[Electronics City]] was the brainchild of [[R. K. Baliga]]. He was the first Chairman and Managing Director of Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation (in the 1976 the government agency was created to expanding the electronics industry in the state of [[Karnataka]]). Baliga proposed the concept of developing the electronic city in the 1970s. The agency purchased {{convert|335|acre|km2}} of land 18 km south of Bangalore for its Electronics City project, which was meant to establish an [[industrial park]] in Bangalore. Notwithstanding complaints by the industrial park's tenants on the condition of the roads, power and water availability, KEONICS claimed initially that the title of ''Silicon Valley of India'' belonged to the city's Electronics City campus.<ref name=siliconvalley /> As part of its promotion of this concept, KEONICS distributed reprints of an article entitled "Can Bangalore become India's Silicon Valley" that first appeared in "''Plus: The Total Computer Magazine''". The article made references to studies of Bangalore published by [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) that favourably evaluated Bangalore's capacity to grow into a high technology hub, similar to the Silicon Valley. The publication also published interviews with IT industry professionals on the state of the IT industry in Bangalore and their perceptions of what lay ahead in the future. Selected quotes from the interviews included: <blockquote>If the [[Government of India|Centre]] looks at Bangalore to be made into Silicon Valley, it would certainly become the Silicon Valley; If you are talking of a Silicon Valley kind of atmosphere, then Bangalore already has it, but if you are talking of a product a day, then we are far from it; Bangalore is certainly emerging as a software and R&D subcontracting centre for multinationals; It is not an unreasonable comparison to make between Bangalore city and Silicon Valley; Bangalore has the ingredients to become Silicon Valley... It is probably the only city in India that could become one.<ref name=siliconvalley /> </blockquote>
