of [[self-similarity]] and the principle of continuity: [[natura non facit saltus]]. We also see that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that "the straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for "packing", Leibniz told to his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept. == Scientist and engineer == Leibniz's writings are currently discussed, not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized, but as ways of advancing present knowledge. Much of his writing on physics is included in Gerhardt's ''Mathematical Writings''. ===Physics=== {{See also|dynamism (metaphysics)}} Leibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging about him, often disagreeing with [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He devised a new theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] ([[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) based on [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], which posited space as relative, whereas Newton felt strongly space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his ''Specimen Dynamicum'' of 1695.<ref>Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker §46, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989).</ref> Until the discovery of subatomic particles and the [[quantum mechanics]] governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [[Albert Einstein]] by arguing, against Newton, that [[space]], [[time]] and motion are relative, not absolute. [[Leibniz's rule]] is an important, if often overlooked, step in many proofs in diverse fields of physics. The [[principle of sufficient reason]] has been invoked in recent [[cosmology]], and his [[identity of indiscernibles]] in quantum mechanics, a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense. Those who advocate [[digital philosophy]], a recent direction in cosmology, claim Leibniz as a precursor. ====The ''vis viva''==== Leibniz's ''[[vis viva]]'' (Latin for ''living force'') is ''mv''<sup>2</sup>, twice the modern [[kinetic energy]]. He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems, so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter.<ref>See Ariew and Garber 155–86, Loemker §§53–55, W II.6–7a)</ref> Here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute. His ''vis viva'' was seen as rivaling the [[conservation of momentum]] championed by Newton in England and by [[Descartes]] in France; hence [[academics]] in those countries tended to neglect Leibniz's idea. [[Engineer]]s eventually found ''vis viva'' useful, so that the two approaches eventually were seen as complementary. ===Other natural science=== By proposing that the earth has a molten core, he anticipated modern [[geology]]. In [[embryology]], he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the [[life sciences]] and [[paleontology]], he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, ''Protogaea'', unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal [[organismic theory]].<ref>On Leibniz and biology, see Loemker (1969a: VIII).</ref> In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view. ===Social science=== In [[psychology]],<ref>On Leibniz and psychology, see Loemker (1969a: IX).</ref> he anticipated the distinction between [[conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] states. In public health, he advocated establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over [[epidemiology]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. He worked to set up a coherent medical training programme, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance scheme, and discussed the [[balance of trade]]. He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as [[game theory]]. In [[sociology]] he laid the ground for [[communication theory]]. ===Technology=== In 1906, Garland published a volume of Leibniz's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work. To date, few of these writings have been translated into English. Nevertheless, it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor, engineer, and applied scientist, with great respect for practical life. Following the motto ''theoria cum praxis'', he urged that theory be combined with practical application, and thus has been claimed as the father of [[applied science]]. He designed wind-driven propellers and water pumps, mining machines to extract ore, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc. With [[Denis Papin]], he invented a [[steam engine]]. He even proposed a method for desalinating water. From 1680 to 1685, he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal [[silver]] mines in the [[Harz Mountains]], but did not succeed.<ref>Aiton (1985), 107–114, 136</ref> ====Computation==== Leibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.<ref>Davis (2000) discusses Leibniz's prophetic role in the emergence of calculating machines and of formal languages.</ref> Early in life, he documented the [[binary number]] system (base 2), which is used on computers, then revisited that system throughout his career.<ref>See Couturat (1901): 473–78.</ref> He anticipated [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrangian interpolation]] and [[algorithmic information theory]]. His [[calculus ratiocinator]] anticipated aspects of the [[universal Turing machine]]. In 1934, [[Norbert Wiener]] claimed to have found in Leibniz's writings a mention of the concept of [[feedback]], central to Wiener's later [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] theory. In 1671, Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetical operations, gradually improving it over a number of years. This "[[Stepped Reckoner]]" attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the [[Royal Society]] in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in [[Hanover]], by a craftsman working under Leibniz's supervision. It was not an unambiguous success because it did not fully mechanize the operation of carrying.
