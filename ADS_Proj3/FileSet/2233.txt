Privileges and rights are given based on these groups. A user of the forum can automatically be promoted to a more privileged user group based on criteria set by the administrator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.websitetoolbox.com/message_board/features.html |title=Message Board Features - Website Toolbox |accessdate=2009-07-12 |publisher=Website Toolbox}}</ref> A person viewing a closed thread as a ''member'' will see a box saying he does not have the right to submit messages there, but a ''moderator'' will likely see the same box granting him access to more than just posting messages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/vb2_manual_cp_usergroups |title=vBulletin Manual: User Groups and Permissions |accessdate=2008-11-04 |publisher=vBulletin}}</ref> An unregistered user of the site is commonly known as a ''guest'' or ''visitor''. Guests are typically granted access to all functions that do not require database alterations or breach privacy. A guest can usually view the contents of the forum or use such features as ''read marking'', but occasionally an administrator will disallow visitors to read their forum as an incentive to become a registered member.<ref group="note">''read marking'' is the process through which a thread, post or forum which has been viewed is distinguished from those which have not. The function is usually automatic with the addition of controls, like ''Mark All'' etc.</ref> A person who is a very frequent visitor of the forum, a section or even a thread is referred to as a [[lurker]] and the habit is referred to as ''lurking''. Registered members often will refer to themselves as ''lurking'' in a particular location, which is to say they have no intention of participating in that section but enjoy reading the contributions to it. ====Moderator==== The ''moderators'' (short singular form: "mod") are users (or employees) of the forum who are granted access to the [[#Post|posts]] and [[#Thread|threads]] of all [[#Memeber|members]] for the purpose of ''moderating discussion'' (similar to [[arbitration]]) and also keeping the forum clean (neutralizing [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[spambot]]s etc.).<ref name="Administrator seeking moderators to control spam abuse.">{{cite web |accessdate=2010-04-20 |publisher=ddforums.com |title=Administrator seeking moderators to control spam abuse. |url=http://www.ddforums.com/showpost.php?p=12566&postcount=9}}</ref> Because they have access to all posts and threads in their area of responsibility, it is common for a friend of the site owner to be promoted to moderator for such a task. Moderators also answer users' concerns about the forum, general questions, as well as respond to specific complaints. They also can do anything to lend a helping hand to a user in need.<ref name="PlaystationForumNewUserGuide">{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-22 |publisher=playstation.com |title=PlayStation.com Forums New User Guide. |url=http://boardsus.playstation.com/playstation/board/message?board.id=announcements&message.id=16#modteam}}</ref> Moderators themselves may have ranks: some may be given mod privileges over only a particular topic or section, while others (called 'global' or 'super') may be allowed access anywhere. Common privileges of moderators include: deleting, merging, moving, and splitting of posts and threads, locking, renaming, [[#Thread|stickying]] of threads, banning, suspending, unsuspending, unbanning, warning the members, or adding, editing, removing the polls of threads.<ref name="vBFAQModAdmin">{{cite web |accessdate=2008-09-14 |publisher=vBulletin.com |title=vBulletin FAQ: Moderators and Administrators |url=http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/faq.php?faq=vb3_reading_posting#faq_vb3_mods_admins}}</ref> 'Junior Modding', 'Backseat Modding', or 'Forum copping' can refer negatively to the behavior of ordinary users who take a moderator-like tone in criticizing other members. Essentially, it is the duty of the moderator to manage the day-to-day affairs of a forum or board as it applies to the stream of user contributions and interactions. The relative effectiveness of this user management directly impacts the quality of a forum in general, its appeal, and its usefulness as a community of interrelated users. ====Administrator==== The ''administrators'' (short form: "admin") manage the technical details required for running the site. As such, they may promote (and demote) [[#Member|members]] to [[#Moderator|moderators]], manage the rules, create sections and sub-sections, as well as perform any [[database]] operations ([[Backup|database backup]] etc.). Administrators often also act as [[#Moderator|moderators]]. Administrators may also make forum-wide announcements, or change the appearance (known as the skin) of a forum.<ref name="vBFAQModAdmin"/> The term ''prune'' used extensively in administration panels is synonymous with ''delete'' or ''remove''. The term comes from [[pruning]], the practice of removing diseased, non-productive, or otherwise unwanted portions from a plant. ===Post=== A ''post'' is a user submitted message enclosed into a block containing the user's details and the date and time it was submitted. Members are usually allowed to edit or delete their own posts. Posts are contained in threads, where they appear as boxes one after another. The first post starts the thread; this may be called the TS (thread starter) or OP (original post). Posts that follow in the thread are meant to continue discussion about that post, or respond to other replies; it is not uncommon for discussions to be derailed. On Western forums, the classic way to show a member's own details (such as name and avatar) has been on the left side of the post, in a narrow column of fixed width, with the post controls located on the right, at the bottom of the main body, above the signature block. In more recent forum software implementations the Asian style of displaying the members' details above the post has been copied. Posts have an internal limit usually measured in characters. Often one is required to have a message of minimum length of 10 characters. There is always an upper limit but it is rarely reached â€“ most boards have it at either 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 or 50,000 characters. Most forums keep track of a user's postcount. The postcount is a measurement of how many posts a certain user has made.<ref name="postcount">{{cite web |accessdate=2009-11-11 |publisher=TechnoFyed.com |title=Postcount Information |url=http://www.technofyed.com/showthread.php?tid=219}}</ref> Users with higher postcounts are often considered more reputable than users with lower postcounts. Some forums have disabled postcounts in the hopes that doing so will reduce the emphasis on quantity over quality of information. ===Thread=== {{see also|conversation threading}} A thread (sometimes called a topic) is a collection of posts, usually displayed from oldest to latest, although this is typically configurable: options for newest to oldest and for a threaded view (a tree-like view applying logical reply
