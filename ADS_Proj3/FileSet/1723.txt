November 21, 2005</ref> On February 10, 1993, the [[National Aeronautic Association]] selected the GPS Team as winners of the 1992 [[Collier Trophy|Robert J. Collier Trophy]], the nation's most prestigious aviation award. This team combines researchers from the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], the [[U.S. Air Force]], the [[Aerospace Corporation]], [[Rockwell International|Rockwell International Corporation]], and [[IBM]] Federal Systems Company. The citation honors them "for the most significant development for safe and efficient navigation and surveillance of air and spacecraft because the introduction of [[radio]] navigation 50 years ago." == Basic concept of GPS == A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS [[satellites]] high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include * the time the message was transmitted * precise orbital information (the [[ephemeris]]) * the general system health and rough orbits of all GPS satellites (the almanac). The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite. These distances along with the satellites' locations are used with the possible aid of [[trilateration]], depending on which algorithm is used, to compute the position of the receiver. This position is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes. Three satellites might seem enough to solve for position since space has three dimensions and a position near the Earth's surface can be assumed. However, even a very small clock error multiplied by the very large [[speed of light]]<ref>GPS signals travel at the [[speed of light]], so computing the distance for a given elapsed time is almost a straightforward calculation. However, the speed of light [[speed of light#Interaction with transparent materials|varies]] slightly between the partial vacuum of space and the atmosphere. A receiver can approximate these effects and produce a reasonable estimate. Once a rough position is determined, some receivers carefully compute the amount of atmosphere the signal traveled through and adjust the distance accordingly.</ref> — the speed at which satellite signals propagate — results in a large positional error. Therefore receivers use four or more satellites to solve for the receiver's location and time. The very accurately computed time is effectively hidden by most GPS applications, which use only the location. A few specialized GPS applications do however use the time; these include [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]]. Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions (such as reusing the last known altitude, [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer) to give a less accurate (degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref> {{cite web |title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning | url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6 | archivedate=2006-11-11 |date=2005-04-01 |author=Georg zur Bonsen, Daniel Ammann, Michael Ammann, Etienne Favey, Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name="NAVGPS">{{cite web |title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction |format=PDF |url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf |publisher=US Government}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=GPS Support Notes | url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf | format = PDF | date = January 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-11-10}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}} </ref> === Position calculation introduction === To provide an introductory description of how a GPS receiver works, error effects are deferred to a later section. Using messages received from a minimum of four visible satellites, a GPS receiver is able to determine the times sent and then the satellite positions corresponding to these times sent.
