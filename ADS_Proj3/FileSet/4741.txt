on a Photon Pair as a Probe of Hardy's Paradox", Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 020404 (2009) [http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_releases/paradox_lost_quantum_physicists_say_they_have_resolved_hardys_annihilation_problem] </ref> Related to this, a team of physicists from Japan reported in December, 2008, and published in March, 2009, that they were able to use joint weak measurement to observe a photonic version of Hardy's paradox. In this version, two photons were used instead of a positron and an electron and relied not upon non-annihilation but on polarization degrees of freedom values measured.<ref> K. Yokota, T.

This is usually around 1000 cycles{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} but many flash devices have one block with a specially extended life of 100,000+ cycles that can be used by the [[Flash memory controller]] to track wear and movement of data across segments. Erasable [[optical disc|optical media]] such as [[CD-RW]] and [[DVD-RW]] are rated at up to 1,000 cycles (100,000 cycles for [[DVD-RAM]] media). Wear leveling attempts to work around these limitations by arranging data so that erasures and re-writes are distributed evenly across the medium. In this way, no single erase block prematurely fails due to a high concentration of write cycles. In flash memory, a single block on the chip is designed for longer life than the others so that the memory controller can store operational data with less chance of its corruption.<ref name=Corsair/> Conventional [[file system]]s such as [[File Allocation Table|FAT]], [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]], [[ext2]], and [[NTFS]] were originally designed for magnetic disks and as such rewrite many of their data structures (such as their directories) repeatedly to the same area. Some file systems aggravate the problem by tracking last-access times, which can lead to file [[metadata]] being constantly rewritten in-place. == Types == There are three basic types of wear leveling mechanisms used in Flash memory storage devices:<ref name=Spansion/> * '''No wear leveling''' * '''Dynamic wear leveling''' * '''Static wear leveling''' A Flash memory storage system with '''no wear leveling''' will not last very long if it is writing data to the flash. Without wear leveling, the Flash controller must permanently assign the logical addresses from the [[Operating system|Operating System]] (OS) to the physical addresses of the Flash memory. This means that every write to a previously written block must first be read, erased, modified, and re-written to the same location. This is very time consuming and highly written locations will wear out quickly with other locations even being completely unused. Once a few blocks reach their end of life the drive is no longer operable.<ref name=Spansion/> The first type of real leveling is called '''dynamic wear leveling''' and it uses a map to link Logical Block Addresses (LBAs) from the OS to the physical Flash memory. Each time the OS writes replacement data, the map is updated so the original physical block is marked as ''invalid'' data, and a new block is linked to that map entry. Each time a block of data is re-written to the Flash memory it is written to a new location. However, blocks that never get replacement data sit with no additional wear on the Flash memory. The name comes from only the dynamic data is being recycled. The drive may last longer than one with no wear leveling, but there are blocks still remaining as active that will go unused when the drive is no longer operable.<ref name=Spansion/><ref name=Corsair/> The other type of wear leveling is called '''static wear leveling''' which also uses a map to link the LBA to physical memory addresses. Static wear leveling works the same as dynamic wear leveling except the static blocks that do not change are periodically moved so that these low usage cells are able to be used by other data. This rotational effect enables the SSD to operate until most of the blocks are near their end of life.<ref name=Spansion/><ref name=Corsair/> <br /> {| class="wikitable sortable" |+ Comparison between Static and Dynamic wear leveling<ref name=Corsair/> |- !

When a block or sector does fail, future reads and writes to it can be redirected to a replacement in that pool. * Blocks or sectors on
