cataclysm might be re-ignited and spread to other planets. Prime calls in the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]], meeting them on the surface of Cybertron in time to witness the return of the being called [[Thunderwing]], the focal point of the apocalypse. The combined efforts of Prime, the Wreckers, Jetfire, [[Predacons|Predacon]]-led Decepticons and a unit of aging Centurion drones are barely enough to render [[Thunderwing]] inert. Bludgeon's recovered files bring Optimus Prime to Earth, where an Autobot detachment led by [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] has discovered that a Decepticon infiltration unit led by [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] has broken standard protocol after discovering a new form of Energon. This [[Energon (power source)|Ore-13]] appears to be the same "Ultra-Energon" that Bludgeon used to restore Thunderwing, dormant for millennia after the apocalypse, to life, and Starscream has already used it to fuel a failed attempt to usurp Megatron's leadership (as detailed in the ''[[The Transformers: Infiltration|Infiltration]]'' miniseries). In the ''[[The Transformers: Escalation|Escalation]]'' miniseries, Megatron himself engages Prime and, boosted by Ore-13, overcomes him. Believing their leader dead, the rest of the Autobots attempt to buy the newly-arrived [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] time to collect the clone, but Prime — who has transferred his consciousness to a backup memory in his trailer command post — advises them to exploit Ore-13's weakness and assault Megatron all-out, catalyzing the Decepticon leader's Energon supply and crippling him. ===New Avengers/Transformers=== Bumblebee, Jazz, Optimus Prime, Prowl and Ratchet appeared in [[New Avengers/Transformers]] crossover by Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0702/28/crossover.htm |title=New Avengers/Transformers |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> ==Kiss Players== This Japanese series, told through radio plays, and using the ''[[Transformers: Alternators]]'' (''Binaltech'' in Japan) Optimus Prime toy mold (see "Toys"), branches off from the original animated series, and is set in a different universe than the both the original ''G1'' and ''Binaltech'' continuities. Set in the year 2006 (which, in Japanese continuity, is one year after Prime's death in ''The Transformers: The Movie'', but four years before the third season), it sees Prime's corpse covertly transported to Japan by the government organization, the [[Earth Defense Command]]. The convoy transporting his body was then attacked by a group of female commandos, led by [[Marissa Faireborn]], who had known Prime years ago as a child. Believing they had secured Prime's body, the commandos were taken by surprise by EDC "[[Kiss Players|Kiss Player]]" operative Ringo and her Autrooper mechanoid partner, who killed them all except Marissa. Marissa went to Prime's body, just as an Autrooper began to fuse with it; reflecting on her childhood memories of Prime, she gave his faceplate a final kiss, which initiated an amazing transformation — Marissa and Prime were fused together, and Prime was reborn with a new body, now transforming into a Dodge Ram SRT-10. Marissa and Prime are now on the run from the EDC, and are also frequently opposed by the mysterious "Legion" Transformers. Faced with such foes, Marissa unleashes her "Kiss Player" ability by kissing Prime, fusing with him once again, and increasing his power so that he can best their opponents. Prime is armed with the "Surf Blade", a weapon formed out of Marissa's surfboard, wielded expertly thanks to the knife skills Marissa passes on to him when they merge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toyvey.com/kisskiss |title=Transformers: KissKiss, a Transformers KissPlay information site |publisher=Toyvey.com |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> ==Binaltech== Due to the interference of Ravage (the same future Ravage who appears in the [[Beast Wars]]), most of the events of the [[The Transformers: The Movie|original animated feature]] do not transpire; most importantly the Battle of Autobot City does not occur, and Optimus Prime and [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] do not have their final showdown, meaning that Optimus Prime does not die, and Megatron is never reformatted into Galvatron. As a result, Optimus Prime is present to lead the Transformers during the Binaltech saga. Equipped with knowledge of the future and the danger that would soon be threatening the Transformers, Ravage's machinations included trapping Megatron and a large army of Decepticons in a spacial rift, with the intention of protecting the Decepticons from the approaching [[Unicron]], and forcing the Autobots to face the planet-eater unaided. The Decepticons would then be in a position to conquer whoever was the victor of that battle. Aware of the changes to the timestream, as well as the potential for the entire Autobot race to be annihilated by Unicron, Optimus put into motion Operation Distant Thunder, a plan to undo the damage to the timeline caused by Ravage, restoring the events that were seen in the movie. In a damned-if-they-do, damned-if-they-don't situation, it would mean that saving all the Autobots from Unicron would result in Prime and others such as Prowl, Wheeljack, Ironhide and Ratchet still dying per the original events. But it was hoped they may be able to at least partly avoid such an outcome by sending a "ship in a bottle" back in time — a message to their past selves about all they had learned. Upon discovering that the Matrix was the key to destroying Unicron, Optimus Prime and [[Ultra Magnus]] went on alone to face Unicron, while the rest of the Autobots executed the plan to restore the original timeline, Operation Distant Thunder. It was hoped that at least one of these plans would be successful. Prime was injured in the confrontation with Unicron, and although his injuries were not mortal, he passed the Matrix to Magnus, who shed his outer armor and managed to successfully complete the mission, resulting in the destruction of Unicron. Distant Thunder was ultimately unsuccessful, however as the universe started to rip apart, a black Optimus Prime clone appeared, splitting the Binaltech universe into its own separate continuity, while also restoring the original timeline and stabilizing the multiverse. The clone, obviously friendly to the Transformers, proclaimed that the Binaltech universe must be allowed to continue, as it was important to the future. Optimus Prime questioned the black doppelganger, who explained only that he carried "the Protector's" spark, but refused to reveal any more detailed information than that. Soon after however, the clone,
