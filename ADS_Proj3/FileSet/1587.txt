the standard distinction of [[grammatical function]]s such as [[grammatical subject|subject]] and [[grammatical object|object]]. Constituents ([[parts of speech]]) of a linguistic [[utterance]] are assigned three types or levels of functions: #Semantic function (Agent, Patient, Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed #Syntactic functions (Subject and Object), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression #Pragmatic functions (Theme and Tail, Topic and Focus), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction == Principles of functional discourse grammar == There are a number of principles that guide the analysis of natural language utterances according to Functional Discourse Grammar. Functional Discourse Grammar explains the phonology, morphosyntax, pragmatics and semantics in one linguistic theory. According to Functional Discourse Grammar, linguistic utterances are built top-down in this order by deciding upon: # The [[Pragmatics| pragmatic]] aspects of the utterance # The [[Semantics| semantic]] aspects of the utterance # The [[Morphosyntax| morphosyntactic]] aspects of the utterance # The [[Phonology| phonological]] aspects of the utterance According to Functional Discourse Grammar, four components are involved in building up an utterance: * The conceptual component, which is where the communicative intention that drives the utterance construction arises * The grammatical component, where the utterance is formulated and encoded according to the communicative intention * The contextual component, which contains all elements that can be referred to in the history of the discourse or in the environment * The output component, which realizes the utterance as sound, writing, or signing The grammatical component consists of four levels: * The interpersonal level, which accounts for the [[pragmatics]] * The representational level, which accounts for the [[semantics]] * The morphosyntactic level, which accounts for the [[syntax]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] * The phonological level, which accounts for the [[phonology]] of the utterance == Example == This example analyzes the utterance "I can't find the red pan. It is not in its usual place." according to Functional Discourse Grammar at the interpersonal level. At the interpersonal level, this utterance is one discourse move, which consists of two [[speech act|discourse acts]], one corresponding to "I can't find the red pan." and another corresponding to "It is not in its usual place." * The first discourse act consists of: ** A [[declarative]] [[illocutionary force]] ** A speaker, denoted by the word "I" ** An addressee ** A communicated content, which consists of: *** A referential subact corresponding to "I" *** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "find", which has the function [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]] *** A referential subact corresponding to "the red pan", which contains two ascriptive subacts corresponding to "red" and "pan", and which has the function [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] * The second discourse act consists of: ** A declarative illocutionary force ** A speaker ** An addressee ** A communicated content, which consists of: *** A referential subact corresponding to "it", which has the function [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] *** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "in its usual place", which has the function Focus **** Within this subact there is a referential subact corresponding to "its usual place", which consists of: ***** A referential subact corresponding to "its" ***** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "usual" ***** An ascriptive subact corresponding to "place" Similar analysis, decomposing the utterance into progressively smaller units, is possible at the other levels of the grammatical component. ==See also== *[[Nominal group (language)|Nominal group]] *[[Thematic equative]] *[[Verbal Behavior (book)]] == References == <references/> == External links == * [http://www.functionalgrammar.com/ Functional Grammar home page] * [http://www.functionaldiscoursegrammar.info/ Functional Discourse Grammar homepage] [[Category:Grammar]] [[Category:Grammar frameworks]] [[Category:Functionalism]] [[de:Functional Discourse Grammar]] [[bn:ক্রিয়াবাদী ভাষাবিজ্ঞান]] [[de:Functional Grammar]] [[es:Gramática funcional]] [[it:Grammatica funzionale]] [[nl:Functionalistische taalkunde]] [[pt:Gramática funcional]] [[ru:Функциональная грамматика]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14385</id> <title>Functional logic (business logic) abstraction</title> <text>{{Context|date=September 2009}} {{Notability|date=September 2009}} Functional Abstraction (or Business Logic Abstraction) is the ability to separate business logic implementation code from the service protocol implementation which is calling it. This architectural abstraction allows the user to implement the business logic in a manner generic to its execution. This separation may also simplify the code, as no connectivity details or other extraneous information need enter the implementation. ==Source== elemenope User Guide ==See also== [[elemenope]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://elemenope.org/ elemenope home page] *[http://elemenope.org/doc/userguide/userguide-1.1.pdf elemenope User Guide] {{DEFAULTSORT:Functional Logic (Business Logic) Abstraction}} [[Category:Software architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14391</id> <title>Functional specification</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}} [[Image:Specification and Levels of Development.jpg|thumb|360px|Systems engineering model of Specification and Levels of Development. During system development a series of specifications are generated to describe the system at different levels of detail. These program unique specifications form the core of the configuration baselines. As shown here, in addition to referring to different levels within the system hierarchy, these baselines are defined at different phases of the design process.<ref name="SEF01"> [http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001</ref>]] {{software development process}} A '''functional specification''' (also, ''functional spec'', ''specs'', ''functional specifications document (FSD)'', or ''Program specification'') in [[systems engineering]] and [[software development]] is the documentation that describes the requested behavior of an engineering system. The documentation typically describes what is needed by the system user as well as requested properties of inputs and outputs (e.g. of the [[software]] system). == Overview == In [[systems engineering]] a specification is a document that clearly and accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items, materials, or services including the procedures by which it can be determined that the requirements have been met. Specifications help avoid duplication and inconsistencies, allow for accurate estimates of necessary work and resources, act as a negotiation and reference document for engineering changes, provide documentation of configuration, and allow for consistent communication among those responsible for the eight primary functions of Systems Engineering. They provide a precise idea of the problem to be solved so that they can efficiently design the system and estimate the cost of design alternatives. They provide guidance to testers for verification (qualification) of each technical requirement.<ref name="SEF01"/> A [[function (engineering)|functional]] specification does not define the inner workings of the proposed system; it does not include the specification how the system function
