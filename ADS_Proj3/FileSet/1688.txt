Gottlob obtained his PhD in computer science at [[Vienna University of Technology]] in 1981. He is currently a chaired professor of computing science at the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory]], where he helped establish the information systems research group. He is also a Fellow of [[St Anne's College, Oxford]]. Previously, he was a professor of computer science at [[Vienna University of Technology]], where he still maintains an adjunct position. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] in May, 2010.<ref name="Royal Society Fellow"/> He is a founding member of the [[Oxford-Man Institute]]. He has published more than 250 scientific articles in the areas of [[computational logic]], [[database theory]], and [[artificial intelligence]], and one textbook on logic programming and databases.<ref>Stefano Ceri, Georg Gottlob, and Letizia Tanca: Logic programming and databases. Springer-Verlag, 1990.</ref> In the area of [[artificial intelligence]], he is best known for his influential early work on the complexity of nonmonotonic logics<ref>Georg Gottlob: Complexity Results for Nonmonotonic Logics. J. Log. Comput. 2(3): 397-425 (1992)</ref><ref> [[Thomas Eiter]] and Georg Gottlob: On the complexity of propositional knowledge base revision, updates, and counterfactuals. Proc. 11th ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART PODS, 1992.</ref> and on [[hypertree decomposition]]s,<ref>[[Thomas Eiter]], Georg Gottlob: Identifying the Minimal Transversals of a Hypergraph and Related Problems.

This work has also had substantial impact in database theory, since it is known that the problem of evaluating [[conjunctive query|conjunctive queries]] on [[relational databases]] is equivalent to the constraint satisfaction problem.<ref>[[Phokion G. Kolaitis]], [[Moshe Y. Vardi]]: Conjunctive-Query Containment and Constraint Satisfaction. J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 61(2): 302-332 (2000).</ref> His recent work on XML query languages (notably [[XPath]]) has helped create the complexity-theoretical foundations of this area.<ref>Georg Gottlob, [[Christoph Koch]], and [[Reinhard Pichler]]: Efficient algorithms for processing XPath queries.
