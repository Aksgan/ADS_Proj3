philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if'' openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p383 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref> Though not widely touted nor publicized, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Hocking]], this variation is known as "[[negative pragmatism]]". Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.<ref>Sahakian & Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 9.</ref> [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: "We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong."<ref>Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 152.</ref> This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey. For Peirce, the idea of "... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ..." fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing. As Feynman noted, an idea or theory "... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right." <ref>Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 152.</ref> Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time. Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience. The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should recognize and account for its diversity. As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."<ref>Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.</ref> ===Minimalist (deflationary) theories=== {{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}} A number of philosophers reject the thesis that the concept or term ''truth'' refers to a real property of sentences or propositions. These philosophers are responding, in part, to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing "...is true") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century. From this point of view, to assert the proposition “'2 + 2 = 4' is true” is logically equivalent to asserting the proposition “2 + 2 = 4”, and the phrase “is true” is completely dispensable in this and every other context. These positions are broadly described *as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words "true" or ''truth'', *as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or *as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.<ref name=EPT/><ref>Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.</ref> Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that "[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis."<ref name=EPT/> Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.) In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate "is true", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence: :''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.'' This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.<ref>Kirkham, Theories of Truth, MIT Press, 1992.</ref> ====Performative theory of truth==== Attributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say "'Snow is white' is true" is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says "I do" at the appropriate time in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking this man to be her lawful wedded husband. She is not ''describing'' herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such "illocutionary acts" is [[J. L. Austin]], "[[How to Do Things With Words]]"<ref>J. L. Austin, "How to Do Things With Words". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975</ref>). Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: "To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement. When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.' The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'"<ref>[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)</ref> ====Redundancy and related theories==== {{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}} According to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. For example, making the assertion that " 'Snow is white' is true" is equivalent to asserting "Snow is white". Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in
