It is a windows-based [[desktop environment]] with [[open source]] applications and system utilities developed upon the reBOX web application framework by [http://icube.at iCUBE Network Solutions], an Austrian company located in [[Vienna]]. == About the project == [http://oos.cc OOS.cc], which is short for Online Operating System, is a web application platform that mimics the look and feel of classic desktop operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] or [[KDE]]. It consists of various open source applications built upon the so-called reBOX web application framework. As applications can be executed in an integrated and parallel way, the OOS can be considered a [[web operating system]], [[web desktop]] or [[webtop]]. It provides basic services such as a [[GUI]], a virtual [[file system]], [[access control]] management and possibilities to develop and deploy applications online. As the Online Operating System is executed within a [[web browser]], it is no real operating system but rather a portal to various web applications, offering a high usability and flexibility. The project is partly funded by grants from the [http://www.ipa.at/ Internetprivatstiftung Austria (IPA)]. As at 01.08.2008 almost 20.000 users have joined the oos.cc community, using the offered featured and applications. == History == The development of the web desktop was started by [http://icube.at/ iCUBE Network Solutions] in 2005, followed by the first beta releases in 2006. Hence, together with [[YouOS]] and [[eyeOS]], it can be considered to be one of the first publicly available systems of its kind. The first full version including core-level multi-language support, the file system and a basic set of applications was released to the public in March 2007 on the occasion of a national exhibition ([http://www.itnt.at ITnT Austria]) and has left beta state half a year later in October 2007. The first release considered stable (1.0.0) was published in July 2007. The project itself and the contained applications have received several national innovation awards (see <ref name="net06"> {{cite web | url = http://www.netidee.at/die_netidee_2006/gefoerderte_projekte_2006/ |title = Netidee 2006 - Austrian Innovation Award by the Internetprivatstiftung Austria }} </ref>, <ref name="net07"> {{cite web |url = http://www.netidee.at/die_netidee_2007/gefoerderte_projekte_2007/ |title = Netidee 2007 - Austrian Innovation Award by the Internetprivatstiftung Austria }} </ref>) and have gained attention mainly due to the comprehensive approach taken (see <ref name=" STAN01"> {{cite web |url = http://icube.at/files/070612-standard-icube-oos.pdf |title = derStandard.at - Den Desktop stehts zur Verfügung (WebTip) |date = 2007-06-12 }} </ref>,<ref name="STAN02a">{{cite web |url = http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=3092209 |title = derStandard.at - Das "Online-Betriebssystem" OOS weist Google-Labs in die Schranken (Austrian newspaper - official archive) |author = Zsolt Wilhelm |date = 2007-10-29 }} </ref>,<ref name="STAN02b">{{cite web |url = http://icube.at/files/071029-webstandard-oos.pdf |title = derStandard.at - Das "Online-Betriebssystem" OOS weist Google-Labs in die Schranken (Austrian newspaper - Offline Copy) |author = Zsolt Wilhelm |date = 2007-10-29 }} </ref>). OOS.cc started as a national project. The full platform including all offered applications are currently available in three languages (German, English as well as Spanish) and is receiving increasing coverage around the world (for examples see <ref name=" TAG ">{{cite web |url = http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/digital/internet/846484.html |title = Tagesanzeiger.ch (Swiss Newspaper) |date = 2008-02-28 }} </ref>,<ref name="HOB">{{cite web |url = http://simon.hibbott.com/2008/02/29/online-operating-system/ |title = Web 2.0 Online Operating System |author = Simon Hibbott |date = 2008-02-29 }} </ref>,<ref name="CNBETA">{{cite web |url = http://www.cnbeta.com/articles/51756.htm |title = cnbeta.com - Chinese WebOS Review |date = 2007-06-12 }} </ref>,<ref name="COMP">{{cite web |url = http://www.computerra.ru/gid/362678/ |title = computerra.ru - Russian Web-Desktop Review |author = Andrew Krupin |date = 2008-07-11 }} </ref>,<ref name="BLOG">{{cite web |url = http://akademikbilisim.blogspot.com/2007/08/ooscc-ile-kendinize-evrimii-sanal.html |title = blogspot.com - Turkish Blog Review including a video-tutorial |date = 2007-08-29 }} </ref> or <ref name="FREELINE">{{cite web |url = http://www.freelinereport.com/freeline-6-2-08/ |title = Free Line Three Part Report, Part 1: EyeOS, YouOS, GlideOS, iCube, MS DOS - Battle of the Web Tops - Free Line Report 6.2.08 |date = 2008-02-06 }} </ref>). The current version is 1.3.01 from 01.08.2008. == Technical Overview == The project is fully written in [[Javascript]], exclusively using [[DHTML]] techniques to run in any [[web browser]] without any additional software installation needed. The system implements a modern kind of web application model <ref name="Garrett">{{cite web |url = http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/essays/archives/000385.php |title = Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications |publisher = AdaptivePath.com |author = Jesse James Garrett |date = 2005-02-18 |accessdate = 2008-06-19 }} </ref>, excessively using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] for communicating between client components and the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] server backend in an exclusively [[asynchronous]] manner. Aim is to offer users the unique interaction behavior following the [[desktop metaphor]], which is the main idea of any [[web desktop]]. Also typical for this sort of web application is the broadly use of Javascript-on-demand <ref name="AP">{{cite web |url = http://ajaxpatterns.org/On-Demand_Javascript |title = Ajax Patterns On-Demand Javascript }} </ref> techniques, cutting the complete project source into pieces and loading them instantly when needed. Based on this technical basis, reBOX is the framework library all applications in oos.cc are built of. It is a fully flexible and extensible API, including a [[GUI widget]] set, communication mechanisms and server services offering general and framework specific services. The Online Operating System itself consists of a basic framework, which is able to launch any [[JavaScript]] application using the reBOX library. The user interface is based on the behavior of the windows desktop with a start menu, a task bar and a desktop background. All applications are running in this environment. At server side, there are [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based [[web services]]
