These facilities often have both a SIGINT receiving and a higher-level management and control function. Jeffrey Richelson, for the George Washington University National Security Archive, links the Air Force's 544th Intelligence Group with ECHELON operations <ref name=NSAEBB24-index2>{{citation | last = Richelson | first = Jeffrey T. | title = National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 24: The National Security Agency Declassified | date=January 13, 2000 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB23/index2.html | accessdate = 2007-10-11 }}</ref>. He places its Detachment 2 located at Sabana Seca, Puerto Rico; Detachment 3 at Sugar Grove, West Virginia; and Detachment 4 at Yakima, Washington. In the 1994 Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) history, Misawa is specifically associated with ECHELON only in the context of a collection system called LADYLOVE. Misawa, although many of its SIGINT units were deactivated in 2000-2001, still had an RSOC coordination role.<ref name=AIA94>{{citation | last = US Air Force | title = History of the Air Intelligence Agency, 1 January - 31 December 1994 | date = 15June1995 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB23/12-01.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-11 }}</ref> The AIA history says the "Misawa LADYLOVE activity was initiated during the Cold War to intercept Soviet military communications transmitted via satellite—along with similar operations at Menwith Hill, UK; Bad Aibling, Germany; and Rosman, North Carolina." According to [[Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)|Duncan Campbell]], "In 1999, the Sabana Seca field station appeared to have at least four radomes for satellite communications, one located beside an existing high frequency interception system targeted on Cuban radio communications."<ref name=CampbellIC2000 /> According to Richelson, this is the assignment of Detachment 2 of the [[544th Information Operations Group|544th Intelligence Group]].<ref name=NSAEBB24-index2 /> The Naval Security Group Activity (NAVSECGRUACT) at Sugar Grove, West Virginia, has missions defined including "maintaining and operating an ECHELON site"<ref name=SugarGrove>{{citation | last = Commander, Naval Security Group | title = NAVSECGRU Instruction C5450.48A, Subj: Mission, Functions and Tasks of Naval Security Group Activity (NAVSECGRUACT) Sugar Grove, West Virginia, |date=September 3, 1991 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB23/09-02.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-11 }}</ref>. Detachment 3 of the US Air Force 544th Intelligence Group is a tenant at Sugar Grove, and the 544th has been associated with ECHELON activities. While the main subordinate command at Sugar Grove is redacted, it would appear, given the presence of large satellite antennas at Sugar Grove, but it not appearing in lists of NSOCs, that it is principally an intercept facility.<ref name=CampbellIC2000 /> Campbell associates Sugar Grove with NSA programs called TIMBERLINE, LANFORD, LATERAL, and SALUTE. The Yakima site, home of Detachment 4 of the 544th, is considered an ECHELON site:<ref name=EPE /> "Six satellite antennas have been installed on the site [they are claimed to be] trained on INTELSAT satellites over the Pacific (two satellite antennas) and INTELSAT satellites over the Atlantic, and on INMARSAT Satellite 2. "The fact that Yakima was established at the same time as the first generation of INTELSAT satellites went into orbit, and the general description of the tasks of the 544th Intelligence Group, suggest that the station has a role in global communications surveillance. A further clue is provided by Yakima’s proximity to a normal satellite receiving station, which lies {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} to the north." ====United States: Tactical Ground Systems==== Some systems are used at land stations of all services. AN/TSQ-190(V) TROJAN SPIRIT II (TS II) is a mobile SHF satellite communications (SATCOM) system that uses commercial or military satellites to receive, transmit, and process secure, voice, data, video teleconferencing (VTC), and facsimile communications. It provides 14 channels of digital voice or data, to intelligence (SCI) or general military (GENSER) with a maximum aggregate data rate of 1.544 megabits per second (Mbit/s). LAN communications are supported by SCI and GENSER ethernets. Routers provide access to the [[SIPRNET]], [[JWICS]], NSA networks, and the defense SATCOM system, as needed for coordinating MAGTF SIGINT and other intelligence operations. The system fits into 3 HMMWVs with mounted standard integrated command postlightweight multipurpose shelters, tunnel-mounted power generation units, and towed 2.4 meter (C, Kuband) and 6.1 meter (C, Ku, X-band) antennas. TROJAN SPIRIT II is being replaced by AN/TSQ-226(V)TROJAN SPIRIT LITE. The TROJAN SPIRIT LITE is fielded in three versions: :*(V)1 -a commercial off-the-shelf version in a transit case configuration used to augment Military Intelligence dissemination and communications requirements primarily at corps and division, and some EAC :*(V)2) for the Marines :*(V)2-SBCT (pallet, shelter, ECV, trailer) for Army Brigade Combat Teams :*(V)3
