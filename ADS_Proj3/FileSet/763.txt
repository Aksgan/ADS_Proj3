[[Category:Computer hardware companies]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6920</id> <title>Combi steamer</title> <text>A '''combi steamer''' (or '''combi-steamer''') is a professional cooking appliance that combines the functionality of a [[convection oven]] and a [[Food steamer|steam cooker]]. That is, it can produce dry heat, moist heat or a combination of the two at various temperatures. Therefore it is fit for many culinary applications including baking, roasting, grilling, steaming, braising, blanching, and poaching. Advantages of this technology are very short cooking times and a gentle preparation method, which leads to better preservation of vitamins and nutritional value of foods than with traditional cooking methods. {{Uncategorized|date=January 2011}} {{tech-stub}} [[de:Heißluftdämpfer]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6921</id> <title>Combination</title> <text>{{Redirect|Combin|the mountain massif|Grand Combin}} {{Other uses}} In [[mathematics]] a '''combination''' is a way of selecting several things out of a larger group, where (unlike [[permutations]]) order does not matter. In smaller cases it is possible to count the number of combinations. For example given three fruit, an apple, orange and pear say, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally a ''k''-'''combination''' of a set ''S'' is a subset of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S''. If the set has ''n'' elements the number of ''k''-combinations is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]] :<math> \binom nk = \frac{n(n-1)\ldots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\dots1},</math> which can be written using [[factorial]]s as <math>\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</math> whenever <math>k\leq n</math>, and which
