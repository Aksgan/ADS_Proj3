This project helped analyze potential drug candidates for a medical therapy in the fight against smallpox virus. It made use of the "LigandFit" software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the [[smallpox]] virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/smallpox/about.htm|title=About The Smallpox Project|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> 35 million potential drug molecules were screened against several smallpox proteins, resulting in 44 strong potential treatments.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The partners of the project included [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Center]], [[Essex University]], [[Evotec OAI]], [[Accelrys]], and [[IBM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/smallpox/participants.htm|title=Smallpox participants|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> The [[World Community Grid]] largely began because of the success of this project in shaving years off research time. === Anthrax Project === The ''Anthrax Research Project'' was a part of the United Devices "Patriot Grid" initiative to fight biological terrorism. It made use of the "LigandFit" software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the advanced stages of [[anthrax]] bacterial infection. The project was operated from January 22, 2002 until February 14, 2002 and ended after a total of 3.57 billion molecules had finished screening. The results of the research project were transmitted to biological scientists in order to finish the screening of the computational simulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/anthrax/index.htm|title=The Anthrax Research Project|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> The partners of the project included [[Oxford University]]. === HMMER Project === The [[HMMER| HMMER Genetic Research]] project made use of the [[Hidden Markov model]] to search for patterns in genetic DNA sequences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/hmmr/|title=Genetic Testing with HMMR|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> === Webload Project === The ''Web Performance Testing'' project was operated as a commercial opportunity with select [[web hosting]] providers in order to help them test the scalability of their server infrastructures under periods of high-demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/web_test/|title=Web Performance Testing|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> == See also == *[[List of distributed computing projects]] == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.grid.org/ Grid.org] (redirects to the [[UniCluster]] website). *[http://www.nfcr.org/ The National Foundation for Cancer Research] *[http://www.ud.com/ United Devices Inc.] *[http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/ Department of Chemistry at the University of Oxford] *[http://www.evotec.com/ Evotec OAI - drug R&D company] {{DEFAULTSORT:Grid.Org}} [[Category:Distributed computing projects]] [[Category:Computing websites]] [[Category:2001 establishments]] [[Category:Research projects]] [[nl:United Devices Cancer Research Project]] [[ja:United Devices Cancer Research Project]] [[pl:Grid.org]] [[zh:Grid.org]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15827</id> <title>GridCC</title> <text><!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Grid_tw.gif|thumb|right|150px|GRIDCC Logo]] --> The '''''G'''rid enabled '''R'''emote '''I'''nstrumentation with '''D'''istributed '''C'''ontrol and '''C'''omputation'' ('''GRIDCC''') is a project funded by the [[European Community]], aimed to provide access to and control of distributed complex instrumentation. The goal of GRIDCC is to exploit grid opportunities for the secure and collaborative work of distributed teams, in order to remotely operate and monitor scientific equipment using the grid’s massive memory and computing resources for storing and processing data generated by this kind of equipment. == GRIDCC services == [[Image:GRIDCC_Services.jpg|thumb|right|250px|GRIDCC Services]] # '''[[Virtual Control Room]] (VCR)''': Provides a common set of collaboration tools and allows users to build complex workflows, which are then submitted to the Execution Services, and to directly monitor and control remote instruments in real-time. # '''Compute Elements (CE)''' and '''Storage Elements (SE)''': Provide access to computing and storage resources, which are common place in [[Grid computing|Grid]] infrastructures. # '''Execution Services (ES)''': They control the execution of the workflows defined by the user in the VCR, maintaining the status of the tasks that make up the workflow. Also, they support the advance reservation of resources. This information is passed to the user in the VCR upon request. # '''Problem Solver (PS)''': Offers automated problem solving in a [[Grid computing|Grid]] environment at two levels. The first, local to a given Instrument Element, allows to solve problems related to functionalities of a given instrument. The second, which is global, allows to solve system-wide problems. # '''Security Services (SS'''): GRIDCC uses a split security system. When interacting with components of other [[Grid computing|Grids]] the GSI security will be used and the users identified by their [[X.509]] proxy certificate. When interacting with the IE the user will be identified by a [[Kerberos protocol|Kerberos]] ticket. # '''Information Service (IS'''): It stores information about resources and provides such information to the ES and VCR to discover available and appropriate resources. # '''Monitoring Service (MS)''': This service uses a publish/subscribe system to disseminate monitoring data. Candidates include RGMA, [http://www.naradabrokering.org/ NaradaBrokering], [[Java Message Service|Sun Message Queue-JMS]], [[Globus project|Globus]] Toolkit 4.0 WSRF and IBM RMM-JMS. # '''[[Instrument Element]] (IE'''): This is a unique concept to GRIDCC. It consists of a coherent collection of services which provide all the functionality to configure, partition and control the physical instrument. In other words we define the term ‘Instrument Element’ (IE) as a set of services that provides the needed interface and implementation that enables the remote control and monitoring of physical instruments. The IE needs to be really flexible; in the simplest scenario this abstraction can represent a simple geospatial sensor or an FPGA card that performs a specific function, while in a more complex network of sensors it can be used as a bridge between the sensors and the computational grid. Finally, the IE can be part of the device instrumentation, permitting the organisation of the instrument into a network that allows grid interaction. == Consortium == *[[:it:Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare]], Legnaro, Italy *[[Brunel University]], Uxbridge, United Kingdom *[[IBM|International Business Machine (IBM)]], Haifa, Israel *[[Imperial College|Imperial College of London]], London, United Kingdom *[[GRNET|Greek Research and Technology Network S.A.]], Athens, Greece *[http://www.iasa.gr/ Institute of Accelerating Systems and Applications], Athens, Greece *[[:it:Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni|Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni]], Italy *[http://www.imaa.cnr.it/ Istituto di Metodologie per l’Analisi Ambientale] - [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]], Potenza, Italy *[http://hcilab.uniud.it/ Human-Computer Interaction Lab] at [[Università degli Studi di Udine]], Udine, Italy *[http://www.elettra.trieste.it/
