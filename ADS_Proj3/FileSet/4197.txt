the amount of spam messages sent out. As of 13 July 2008, the botnet is believed to be responsible for roughly 40% of all the spam on the net, a sharp decline from the almost 60% share in May 2008.<ref name="SpamStats">{{cite news | first = Marshall| title = Spam statistics from TRACE | publisher = Marshall | date = July 13, 2008 | url = http://www.marshal.com/TRACE/spam_statistics.asp | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> == Origins == The earliest reports on Srizbi trojan outbreaks were around June 2007, with small differences in detection dates across [[antivirus software]] vendors.<ref name="outbreaksymantec">{{cite news | title = Trojan.Srizbi | publisher = Symantec| date = July 23, 2007 | url = http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2007-062007-0946-99&tabid=1 | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref><ref name="outbreaksophos">{{cite news | title = Troj/RKAgen-A Trojan (Rootkit.Win32.Agent.ea, Trojan.Srizbi) - Sophos security analysis | publisher = Sophos| date = August 2007 | url = http://www.sophos.com/security/analyses/viruses-and-spyware/trojrkagena.html | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> However, reports indicate that the first released version had already been assembled on 31 March 2007.<ref name="secuworks">{{cite news | last = Stewart| first = Joe| title = Inside the "Ron Paul" Spam Botnet | publisher = SecureWorks | date = December 4, 2007 | url = http://www.secureworks.com/research/threats/ronpaul/?threat=ronpaul | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> There is currently no sign of decline in the number of bots involved in the botnet. The Srizbi botnet by some experts is considered the second largest botnet of the Internet. However, there is controversy surrounding the [[Kraken botnet]];<ref>http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=150292&WT.svl=news1_1</ref><ref>http://www.trustedsource.org/TS?do=threats&subdo=blog&id=32</ref><ref>http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001418.html</ref> it may be that Srizbi is the largest botnet today. == Spread and botnet composition == The Srizbi botnet consists of computers which have been infected by the Srizbi [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]]. This trojan horse is deployed onto its victim computer through the [[MPack (software)|Mpack]] [[malware]] kit.<ref name="malwarepack">{{cite news | last = Keizer | first = Gregg | title = Mpack installs ultra-invisible Trojan | publisher = ComputerWorld | date = July 5, 2007 | url = http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9026323 | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> Past editions have used the "n404 web exploit kit" malware kit to spread, but this kit's usage has been deprecated in favor of [[MPack (software)|Mpack]].<ref name="secuworks"/> The distribution of these malware kits is partially achieved by utilizing the botnet itself. The botnet has been known to send out spam containing links to fake videos about celebrities, which include a link pointing to the malware kit. Similar attempts have been taken with other subjects such as illegal software sales and personal messages.<ref name="messages">{{cite news | last = Blog | first = TRACE| title = Srizbi uses multi-pronged attack to spread malware | publisher = Marshal Limited| date = March 7, 2008 | url = http://www.marshal.com/trace/traceitem.asp?article=595&thesection=trace | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = McKenzie| first = Grey| title = Srizbi Botnet Is Largely Responsible for Recent Sharp Increase In Spam | publisher = National Cyber Security| date = June 25, 2008 | url = http://www.nationalcybersecurity.com/blogs/778/-Srizbi-Botnet-Is-Largely-Responsible-for-Recent-Sharp-Increase-In-Spam.html | accessdate = 2008-07-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="traceblog">{{cite news | title = Srizbi spam uses celebrities as lures | publisher = TRACE Blog| date = February 20, 2008 | url = http://www.marshal.com/trace/traceitem.asp?article=568&thesection=trace | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> Apart from this self-propagation, the MPack kit is also known for much more aggressive spreading tactics, most notably the compromise of about 10,000 websites in June 2007.<ref name="10khostcompromise"> {{cite news | last = Keizer | first = Gregg | title = Hackers compromise 10k sites, launch 'phenomenal' attack | publisher = ComputerWorld | date = June 10, 2007 | url = http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9025198 | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> These domains, which included a surprising number of pornographic websites,<ref>{{cite news | last = Keizer | first = Gregg | title = Porn sites serve up Mpack attacks | publisher = ComputerWorld | date = June 22, 2007 | url = http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9025578 | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> ended up forwarding the unsuspecting visitor to websites containing the MPack program. Once a computer becomes infected by the trojan horse, the computer becomes known as a [[bot]], which will then be at the command of the controller of the botnet, commonly referred to as the botnet herder.<ref name="herder">{{cite news | title = Spying on bot nets becoming harder | publisher = SecurityFocus| date = October 12, 2006 | url = http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/328 | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> The operation of the Srizbi botnet is based upon a number of servers which control the utilization of the individual bots in the botnet. These servers are redundant copies of each other, which protects the botnet from being crippled in case a system failure or legal action takes a server down. These servers are generally placed in countries such as [[Russia]], where law enforcement against digital crime is limited. === Reactor Mailer === The [[server-side]] of the Srizbi botnet is handled by a program called "Reactor Mailer", which is a [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-based [[web component]] responsible for coordinating the spam sent out by the individual bots in the botnet. Reactor Mailer has existed since 2004, and is currently in its third release, which is also used to control the Srizbi botnet. The software allows for [[secure login]] and allows multiple accounts, which strongly suggests that access to the botnet and its spam capacity is sold to external parties ([[Software as a service]]). This is further reinforced by evidence showing that the Srizbi botnet runs multiple batches of spam at a time; blocks of [[IP address]]es can be observed sending different types of spam at any one time. Once a user has been granted access, he or she can utilize the software to create the message they want to send, test it for its [[Spam assassin|SpamAssassin]] score and after that send it to all the users in a list of e-mail addresses.<ref name="secuworks"/> Suspicion has arisen that the writer of the Reactor Mailer program might be the same person responsible for the Srizbi trojan, as code analysis shows a code fingerprint that matches between the two programs.<ref name="secuworks"/> If this claim is indeed true, then this coder might well be responsible for the trojan behind another botnet, named Rustock. According to [[Symantec]], the code
