employed and the intended use of the amp. For the basics of radio frequency amplifiers using valves, see [[Valved RF amplifiers]]. === Notes on implementation === Real world amplifiers are imperfect. *One consequence is that the power supply itself may influence the output, and must itself be considered when designing the amplifier *The amplifier circuit has an "open loop" performance, that can be described as various parameters ([[gain]], [[slew rate]], output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], [[distortion]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[signal to noise ratio]], etc.) *Many modern amplifiers use [[negative feedback]] techniques to hold the gain at the desired value. Different methods of supplying power result in many different methods of [[Bias (electrical engineering)|bias]]. Bias is a technique by which the active devices are set up to operate in a particular regime, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide both positive and negative voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply. Amplifiers often have multiple stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs may be a different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a class A stage, feeding a class AB push–pull second stage, which then drives a class G final output stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses. == See also == {{Portal|Electronics}} <div style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;"> *[[Amplifier]] *[[Audio amplifier]] *[[Charge transfer amplifier]] *[[Distributed amplifier]] *[[Guitar amplifier]] *[[Instrument amplifier]] *[[Instrumentation amplifier]] *[[Logarithmic video amplifier]] *[[Low noise amplifier]] *[[Negative feedback amplifier]] *[[Operational amplifier]] *[[Optical amplifier]] *[[Power added efficiency]] *[[Programmable gain amplifier]] *[[RF power amplifier]] *[[Valve audio amplifier]] </div> ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Electronic amplifiers}} *[http://www.rane.com/par-a.html#amplifier_classes Rane audio's guide to amplifier classes] *[http://www.audiodesignline.com/175006800 Design and analysis of a basic class D amplifier] *[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-thd.htm Conversion: distortion factor to distortion attenuation and THD] *[http://www.crownaudio.com/pdf/amps/grbgpapr.pdf An alternate topology called the grounded bridge amplifier - pdf] *[http://www.qscaudio.com/support/library/papers/amptalk.pdf Contains an explanation of different amplifier classes - pdf] *[http://www.crownaudio.com/pdf/amps/bcapaper.pdf Reinventing the power amplifier - pdf] *[http://www.caraudiomag.com/specialfeatures/0111cae_anatomy/ Anatomy of the power amplifier, including information about classes] *[http://tons-of-tone.tripod.com/index.html Tons of Tones - Site explaining non linear distortion stages in Amplifier Models] *[http://www.coldamp.com/opencms/opencms/coldamp/files/Class_D_audio_amplifiers_White_Paper_en.pdf Class D audio amplifiers, white paper - pdf] *[http://www.classeradio.org/index.html Class E Radio Transmitters - Tutorials, Schematics, Examples, and Construction Details] {{DEFAULTSORT:Electronic Amplifier}} [[Category:Electronic amplifiers| ]] [[Category:Electronic circuits]] {{Link FA|fr}} [[ca:Amplificador]] [[da:Elektronisk forstærker]] [[de:Verstärker (Elektrotechnik)]] [[es:Amplificador electrónico]] [[fr:Amplificateur électronique]] [[hr:Pojačalo]] [[it:Amplificatore (elettronica)]] [[lv:Elektroniskais pastiprinātājs]] [[nl:Versterker (elektronica)]] [[ja:増幅回路]] [[pl:Wzmacniacz elektryczny]] [[ru:Электронный усилитель]] [[simple:Amplifier]] [[sv:Förstärkare]] [[zh:放大器電路]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11902</id> <title>Electronic commerce</title> <text>{{ecommerce}} '''Electronic commerce''', commonly known as '''e-commerce''' or '''eCommerce''', consists of the buying and selling of [[product (business)|product]]s or [[Service (economics)|service]]s over electronic systems such as the Internet and other [[computer network]]s. The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with widespread Internet usage. The use of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[inventory management]] systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] at least at some point in the transaction's lifecycle, although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as [[e-mail]] as well. A large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely electronically for [[virtual]] items such as access to premium content on a website, but most electronic commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. Online retailers are sometimes known as [[e-tailer]]s and online retail is sometimes known as '''e-tail'''. Almost all big retailers have electronic commerce presence on the [[World Wide Web]]. Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses is referred to as [[business-to-business]] or B2B. B2B can be open to all interested parties (e.g. [[commodity exchange]]) or limited to specific, pre-qualified participants ([[private electronic market]]). Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses and consumers, on the other hand, is referred to as [[business-to-consumer]] or [[B2C]]. This is the type of electronic commerce conducted by companies such as [[Amazon.com]]. [[Online shopping]] is a form of electronic commerce where the buyer is directly online to the seller's computer usually via the internet. There is no intermediary service. The sale and purchase transaction is completed electronically and interactively in real-time such as Amazon.com for new books. If an intermediary is present, then the sale and purchase transaction is called electronic commerce such as [[eBay.com]]. Electronic commerce is generally considered to be the sales aspect of [[e-business]]. It also consists of the exchange of data to facilitate the financing and payment aspects of the business transactions. ==History== ====Early development==== Originally, electronic commerce was identified as the facilitation of commercial transactions electronically, using technology such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). These were both introduced in the late 1970s, allowing businesses to send commercial documents like purchase orders or invoices electronically. The growth and acceptance of credit cards, automated teller machines (ATM) and telephone banking in the 1980s were also forms of electronic commerce. Another form of e-commerce was the airline reservation system typified by Sabre in the USA and Travicom in the UK. From the 1990s onwards, electronic commerce would additionally include [[enterprise resource planning]] systems (ERP), [[data mining]] and [[data warehousing]]. In 1990, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[WorldWideWeb]] [[web browser]] and transformed an academic telecommunication network into a worldwide everyman everyday communication system called internet/www. Commercial enterprise on the [[Internet]] was strictly prohibited until 1991.<ref>[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]: [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html?pg=2 We Are the Web] [[Wired magazine]], Issue 13.08, August 2005</ref> Although the Internet became popular worldwide around 1994 when the first internet online shopping started, it took about five years to introduce security
