Other graphical improvements included a new set of boot up and shutdown splash screens, a new login screen that transitions seamlessly into the desktop and greatly improved performance on Intel graphics chipsets. In June 2009 Canonical created the [[Paper cut (Ubuntu)|One Hundred Paper Cuts]] project, focusing developers to fix minor usability issues.

We're drawn to Light because it denotes both warmth and clarity, and intrigued by the idea that "light" is a good value in software. Good software is "light" in the sense that it uses your resources efficiently, runs quickly, and can easily be reshaped as needed. Ubuntu represents a break with the bloatware of proprietary operating systems and an opportunity to delight to those who use computers for work and play. More and more of our communications are powered by light, and in future, our processing power will depend on our ability to work with light, too. Visually, light is beautiful, light is ethereal, light brings clarity and comfort. Historical perspective: From 2004â€“2010, the theme in Ubuntu was "Human". Our tagline was "Linux for Human Beings" and we used a palette reflective of the full range of humanity. Our focus as a project was bringing Linux from the data center into the lives of our friends and global family. }} Critical responses to the new theme have been mixed. [[Ars Technica]]'s Ryan Paul said "The new themes and updated color palette are nice improvement for Ubuntu... After testing the new theme for several hours, I feel like it's a step forward, but it still falls a bit short of my expectations." Paul also noted that the most controversial aspect of the new design amongst users has been the placement of the window control buttons on the left instead of the right side of the windows.<ref name="Paul06Mar10">{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2010/03/hands-on-a-close-look-at-ubuntus-new-non-brown-theme.ars |title=Hands-on: a close look at Ubuntu's new non-brown theme |accessdate=8 March 2010 |last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=March 2010}}</ref><ref name="Paul04Mar10">{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/03/ubuntu-dumps-the-brown-introduces-new-theme.ars |title=Ubuntu dumps the brown, introduces new theme and branding |accessdate=8 March 2010 |last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=March 2010}}</ref> TechSource's Jun Auza expressed concern that the new theme is too close to that used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Mac OS X]]: "I think Ubuntu is having an identity crisis right now and should seriously consider changing several things in terms of look and feel to avoid being branded as a Mac OS X rip-off, or worse, get sued by Apple."
