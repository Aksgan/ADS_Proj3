program architecture), tends to produce lasagna code. In general, [[client–server]] applications are frequently lasagna code, with well-defined interfaces between client and server. Lasagna code generally enforces [[encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]] between the different "layers", as the subsystems in question may have no means of communication other than through a well-defined mechanism, such as [[Structured Query Language]], a [[foreign function interface]], or [[Remote Procedure Call]]. However, individual layers in the system may be highly unstructured or disorganized. The term was coined by database [[guru]] [[Joe Celko]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dbmsmag.com/9701d06.html |title=The Future of SQL Programming |last=Celko |first=Joe |publisher=DBMS Online |date=January 1997 |accessdate=2008-09-10 }}</ref> ==Spaghetti with meatballs== The term "spaghetti with meatballs" is a pejorative term used in computer science to describe loosely constructed [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) that remains dependent on procedural code. It may be the result of a system whose development has transitioned over a long life-cycle, language constraints, [[Program optimization|micro-optimization]] theatre, or a lack of coherent [[Programming style|coding standards]]. In some languages, OOP features are only available in later specifications. Notable examples of this include [[Visual Basic]], and [[PHP]]. Other languages, like [[C (programming language)|C]], rely on [[Function pointer|function pointers]] to simulate OOP — still requiring the underlying procedural code to which they point. Using OOP does not necessarily prevent the class' code from becoming spaghetti-like. In this parlance, "spaghetti" describes twisted, tangled and unstructured code, while "meatballs" denotes the use of class structures (i.e. objects). ==See also== {{portal|Computer science}} * [[Structured programming]] Coding without <code>goto</code>, e.g. using only loop, sequence and alternate structures. * [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] A competition to produce pleasingly obscure C code. ==References== {{FOLDOC}} {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362929.362947 Go To Statement Considered Harmful].

It could be used by [[Internet site]]s, as an additional source of information about the senders of unsolicited bulk email, better known as [[spam (electronic)|spam]]. SPEWS is no longer active. A successor, the Anonymous Postmaster Early Warning System ([[APEWS]]), appeared in January 2007.<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.net-abuse.blocklisting/msg/b3da24209d8d5319 APEWS announcement of SPEWS replacement]</ref> == Overview == SPEWS itself published a large [[text file]] containing its listings, and operated a [[database]] where users could query the reasons for a listing. Users of SPEWS could reprocess these data into formats usable by software for [[anti-spam techniques (e-mail)|anti-spam techniques]]. For instance, many mail sites used the SPEWS data provided at spews.relays.osirusoft.com. All [[DNSBL]]s hosted by Osirusoft were shut down on August 27, 2003 after several weeks of [[denial of service]] attacks. A number of other [[Mirror (computing)|mirrors]] existed based on the SPEWS data, which remained accessible to the public. [[SORBS]], for example, provided a mirror of SPEWS data until early 2007. There was a certain degree of controversy regarding SPEWS' anonymity and its methods. By remaining anonymous, the SPEWS admins presumably wanted to avoid harassment and lawsuits of the sort which have hampered other anti-spam services such as the [[MAPS RBL]] and [[ORBS]]. Some ISP clients whose providers were listed on SPEWS took umbrage that their own IP addresses were associated with spamming, and that their mail might be blocked by users of the SPEWS data. Sometimes, the only solution was to leave the blacklisted provider, as there was no way for either the customer or the provider to contact SPEWS. The SPEWS database has not been updated since August 24, 2006; dnsbl.com [http://www.dnsbl.com/2007/01/spews-current-status.html lists its status as dead]. Since SPEWS became inactive, the Anonymous Postmaster Early Warning System (APEWS) has taken its place, using similar listing criteria and a nearly-identical web page. == Process == {{refimprove|date=March 2007}} The precise process by which SPEWS gathered data about spam sources is unknown to the public, and it is likely that its operators used multiple techniques. SPEWS seemed to collect some information from [[honeypot]]s—mail servers or single email addresses to which no legitimate mail is received. These may be dummy addresses which have never sent any email (and therefore could not have requested to be subscribed to any legitimate mailing list). They may also be placed as bait in the [[header]] of a [[Usenet]] post or on a Web page, where a spammer might discover them and choose to spam them. The SPEWS Web site makes clear that when spam was received, the operators filed a complaint with the ISP or other site responsible for the spam source. Only if the spam continued after this complaint was the source listed. However, SPEWS is anonymous—when these complaints were sent, they are not marked as being from SPEWS, and the site was not told that ignoring the complaint would result in a listing. This had the effect of determining the ISP's response to a normal user's spam complaint, and also discouraged [[listwashing]]—continuing to spam, but with the complaining address removed from the target list. If the spam did not stop over time, SPEWS increased the size of the address range listed through a process referred to as "escalation". This process was repeated, conceivably until the entire netblock owned by the offending service provider was listed or the block is large enough that the service provider is encouraged to take action by the complaints of its paying customers. === Criteria for listing === SPEWS criteria was based on
