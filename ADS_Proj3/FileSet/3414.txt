as a "Crêpe" or as fluffy as a North American pancake. ===Asia=== [[File:GntRavvaDosa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dosa]], prepared and served at a restaurant in India.]] [[File:Uttapam cool spark.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Uttapam]]'', an Indian style pancake with [[sambar (dish)|Sambhar]].]] [[File:Bánh xèo 2.jpg|thumb|''Bánh xèo'', a style of Vietnamese pancakes.]] In [[India]] the '''Pooda''' (sometimes called '''Cheela''') is a pancake. They can be made either sweet or salty and are of different thicknesses in different places. They are made in a frying pan and are of a similar batter as their European counterpart [[Dosa]], [[Appam]], [[Neer dosa]] and [[Uttapam]] could be said to be another Indian pancakes. They are prepared by fermenting rice batter and split skinned [[urad bean]] (black lentil) blended with water. What [[Punjabis]] call a ''Meetha Pooda'' which are a common breakfast food item in the Punjab. It is a sweet pancake which can be eaten with pickles and [[chutney]]. Most of the [[Assamese Jolpan#Pitha|pitha]]s in [[Assam]] are type of pancakes served on occasions such as [[Bihu]]. [[Chinese pancake]]s may be either savory or sweet, and are generally made with dough rather than batter. In [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], a pancake-like snack known as Apam Balik or Apom Balik(in Malay) or Ban Chian Kuih (面煎粿 in Chinese). The Chinese version is made with a filling, traditionally ground peanut with sugar, butter and additional condiments such as sweetened coconut or egg. Increasingly non-traditional condiments such as cheese, kaya (egg and coconut milk custard), blueberry or chocolate are used in variations. There are other variations, such as those made with [[soya bean]] milk replacing egg and water. The Malay version (Apom Balik) frequently has sweet corn and condensed milk as filling. In the [[Philippines]], pancakes or "hotcakes" are also served with syrup (maple or imitation corn syrup) margarine and sugar or condensed milk. They are served for breakfast, but there are roving street stalls that sell smaller hotcakes topped with margarine and sugar as an afternoon snack. In [[Vietnamese cuisine]] there is a variety of traditional pancakes; these include ''[[bánh xèo]]'' and ''[[bánh khọt]]'' in southern Vietnam, and ''[[bánh căn]]'' and ''[[bánh khoái]]'' in [[central Vietnam]]. In [[Nepal]], the [[Newar]] have a savory rice pancake called ''[[chataamari]]'' cooked with meat or eggs on top. The [[Indonesia]]n pancake [[serabi]] is made from rice flour and coconut milk. In [[Korea]], pancakes include ''[[jeon (food)|jeon]]'', ''[[pajeon]]'', ''[[bindaetteok]]'', ''[[kimchijeon]]'', and ''[[hotteok]]''. [[Banana]] pancakes are a menu item in Western-oriented [[backpacking (travel)|backpacker]]s' cafes in Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China. This has elicited the term ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]''. ===Australia=== In Australia and New Zealand, small pancakes (about 75mm in diameter), known as '''pikelets''' are also eaten. They are traditionally served with jam and/or whipped cream, or solely with butter, at afternoon tea. However, they are also common at morning tea. They are made with milk, self-raising flour, eggs and a small amount of [[icing sugar]]. In some circles in New Zealand, very thin, crêpe-like or UK pancake-like pancakes (around 20 cm in diameter), are known as "flapjacks". This may refer to their thinness, making them more likely to "flap". They are traditionally served with butter, or butter and lemon, possibly something sweet, and then rolled up and eaten. American style pancakes are also popular in Australasia. They are eaten for breakfast or as a dessert, with lemon juice and sugar, butter and maple syrup, stewed fruits such as strawberries and cream, ice cream or [[mascarpone]]. ===Central and Eastern Europe=== In [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Slovakia]] pancakes are called [[palatschinke]], palačinka, and palacinka, respectively (plurals palatschinken, palačinky, palacinky). In [[Romania]] they are called clătită (plural clătite). In countries of [[former Yugoslavia]] ([[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], and [[Bosnia]]) they are called palačinka (plural palačinke). In these languages, the word derives from Latin ''placenta'', meaning cake. These pancakes are thin and filled with apricot, plum, [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberry]], strawberry or apple jam, chocolate sauce or [[hazelnut]] spread. [[Kaiserschmarrn]] is an Austrian pancake including raisins, almonds, apple jam or small pieces of apple, split into pieces and sprinkled with powdered sugar. [[File:Nalesniki.jpg|thumb|left|Home-made ''naleśniki'' filled with sweet white cheese (Poland)]] [[File:Hortobagy palacsinta.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Hortobágyi palacsinta]]'']] In [[Hungary]], pancakes called [[palacsinta]] (also derived from Latin ''placenta'') are made from flour, milk or soda water, sugar and eggs. Sweet wine is added to the batter. The filling is usually jam, sugared and ground walnuts or poppy seeds, sugared cottage cheese, sugared cocoa or cinnamon powder, but – especially in [[hortobágyi palacsinta]] – meat and mushroom fillings are also used. [[Gundel palacsinta]] is an Hungarian pancake, stuffed with walnuts, zest, raisins and rum, served in chocolate sauce. The dish is often flambéed. Hungarian pancakes are served as a main dish or as a dessert. In [[Poland]], thin crêpe-style pancakes are called ''naleśniki'' (pronounced ''naleshniki''). Like any crêpe or blintz, they can be served with a variety of savory or sweet fillings as a main dish or a dessert. Sweet fillings include fresh fruits (e.g. [[bilberry|bilberries]]), jams, and soft white cheese with sugar. Savory fillings include fried vegetables, fried chicken, minced meat, and a variety of added ingredients such as potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage, or ham. The Polish pancake was adopted by the [[Russian cuisine|Russian]] and the [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] cuisines, which call them ''nalesniki''.<ref>[http://www.langet.ru/html/n/nalesniki.html ''Nalesniki''] in V.V.

[[Blintz]]es ({{lang-ru|блинчики}} ''blinchiki'') are thin crepes made without yeast. [[Blini]] ({{lang-ru|блины}}) are thicker pancakes made from wheat or buckwheat flour, butter, eggs, and milk, with yeast added to the batter. Blini cooking has a long history in Russia, dating back to pagan traditions and feasts, which are reflected in today's "[[Maslenitsa|pancake week]]" celebrated in the winter before the [[Great Lent]]. Small thick pancakes made from [[yogurt]] or [[buttermilk]] based batter (without yeast) are called ''oladyi'' ([[:ru:Оладьи|оладьи]]) (diminutive: ''oladushki'' оладушки, further abbreviated as ''ladushki'' ладушки). ===Africa=== "Pancakes" in South Africa refer to crepes.
