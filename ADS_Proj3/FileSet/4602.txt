as soon as possible. Word of the machine quickly reached the AECL, who suggested that they use the $300,000 set aside for the "new" UTEC to purchase the Mark I instead. The Computation Center considered the Mark I to be inferior to their own design and rejected it, notably because it used a serial math unit like their prototype and would thus be much slower. The AECL was not terribly impressed but came up with a solution; if the Computation Center would buy the Mark I, another $150,000 would be made available to continue development of the UTEC, and an equal amount if they decided to actually build it. This sort of deal one does not refuse, and plans to ship the Mark I to Toronto were soon underway. The machine arrived on April 30, 1952, at the time it was major news. Named '''Ferut''' (''Ferranti, University of Toronto'') by Worsley shortly before it arrived, it took the Ferranti engineers several months to set it up. Even then it became one of the first "large" machines to start operation in North America. Ferut would go on to be a major research system in Canada, being used by [[Ontario Hydro]] to calculate changes in water levels due to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], various development of the groundbreaking [[ReserVec]] system with Ferranti Canada for [[Trans Canada Airlines]], and even rental of time for commercial seismic data processing. The arrival of the Ferut also spelled the death of the UTEC project. Even with the additional funding, most of the engineers quickly drifted to the Ferut machine. ==References== * [http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~williams/History_web_site/World%20map%20first%20page/Canada/a2004.pdf UTEC and Ferut: The University of Toronto's Computation Center] [[Category:Early computers]] [[Category:One-of-a-kind computers]] [[Category:Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] [[Category:University of Toronto]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38653</id> <title>UTOPIA (Bioinformatics tools)</title> <text>[[Image:Utopia-desktop600.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|UTOPIA tools on a Mac]] '''UTOPIA''' (User-friendly Tools for OPerating Informatics Applications) is a suite of free tools for visualising and analysing [[bioinformatics]] data. Based on an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-driven data model, it contains applications for viewing and aligning protein sequences, rendering complex molecular structures in 3D, and for finding and using resources such as web services and data objects. Between 2003 and 2005 work on UTOPIA was funded via [http://www.esnw.ac.uk/|The e-Science North West Centre] based at [[The University of Manchester]] by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK Department of Trade And Industry, and the European Molecular Biology Network. Since 2005 work continues under the [http://www.embracegrid.info EMBRACE European Network of Excellence]. == History == UTOPIA's CINEMA (Colour INteractive Editor for Multiple Alignments), a tool for [[Sequence alignment|Sequence Alignment]], is the latest incarnation of software originally developed at The [[University of Leeds]] to aid the analysis of [[GPCR]]s.

One example of such a coupling constant is the [[electric charge]]. In approximate calculations in several quantum field theories, notably [[quantum electrodynamics]] and theories of the [[Higgs particle]], the running coupling appears to become infinite at a finite momentum scale. This is sometimes called the [[Landau pole]] problem. It is not known whether the appearance of these inconsistencies is an artifact of the approximation, or a real fundamental problem in the theory. However, the problem can be avoided if an ultraviolet or '''UV fixed point''' appears in the theory. A quantum field theory has a UV fixed point if its [[renormalization group flow]] approaches a [[fixed point]] in the ultraviolet (i.e. short length scale/large energy) limit. This is related to zeroes of the [[beta-function]] in the [[Callan-Symanzik equation]]. The large length scale/small energy limit counterpart is the [[infrared fixed point]]. ==Specific
