(Husserl:2000), in the formulation of his central methodological work: "On The Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (Mannheim:1993:see fn41 & fn43) - this essay forms the centerpiece for Mannheim's method of historical understanding and is central to his conception of the sociology of knowledge as a research program; and [2] The concept of "Weltanschauung" employed by Mannheim has its origins in the hermeneutic philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey, who relied on Husserl's theory of meaning (above) for his methodological specification of the interpretive act (Mannheim: 1993: see fn38). It is also noteworthy that Husserl's analysis of the formal structures of consciousness, and Schuetz's analysis of the formal structures of the Life-world are specifically intended to establish the foundations, in consciousness, for the understanding and interpretation of a social world which is subject to cultural and historical change. The phenomenological position is that although the [[facticity]] of the social world may be culturally and historically relative, the formal structures of consciousness, and the processes by which we come to know and understand this [[facticity]], are not. That is, the understanding of any actual social world is unavoidably dependent on understanding the structures and processes of consciousness that found, and constitute, any possible social world. Alternately, if the [[facticity]] of the social world '''and''' the structures of consciousness prove to be culturally and historically relative, then we are at an impasse in regard to any meaningful scientific understanding of the social world which is not subjective (as opposed to being objective and grounded in nature [positivism], or inter subjective and grounded in the structures of consciousness [phenomenology]), and relative to the cultural and idealization formations of particular concrete individuals living in a particular socio-historical group. ===Michel Foucault=== {{main|Michel Foucault}} A particularly important contemporary contribution to the sociology of knowledge is found in the work of Michel Foucault. ''Madness and Civilization'' (1961) postulated that conceptions of madness and what was considered "reason" or "knowledge" was itself subject to major [[culture bias]] - in this respect mirroring similar criticisms by [[Thomas Szasz]], at the time the foremost critic of [[psychiatry]], and himself now an eminent psychiatrist. A point where Foucault and Szasz agreed was that sociological processes played the major role in defining "madness" as an "illness" and prescribing "cures". In ''The Birth of the Clinic: An Archeology of Medical Perception'' (1963), Foucault extended his critique to institutional clinical medicine, arguing for the central [[conceptual metaphor]] of "[[Medical gaze|The Gaze]]", which had implications for [[medical education]], [[Prison#Prison_design_and_facilities|prison design]], and the [[carceral state]] as understood today. Concepts of [[criminal justice]] and its intersection with medicine were better developed in this work than in Szasz and others, who confined their critique to current psychiatric practice. ''The Order of Things'' (1966) and ''The Archeology of Knowledge'' (1969) introduced abstract notions of mathesis and taxonomia to explain the subjective 'ordering' of the [[human sciences]]. These, he claimed, had transformed 17th and 18th century studies of "general grammar" into modern "[[linguistics]]", "[[natural history]]" into modern "[[biology]]", and "[[analysis of wealth]]" into modern "[[economics]]"; though not, claimed Foucault, without loss of meaning. The 19th century transformed what knowledge was. Perhaps Foucault's best-known claim was that "Man did not exist" before the 18th century. Foucault regarded notions of humanity and of [[humanism]] as inventions [[modernity]]. Accordingly, a [[cognitive bias]] had been introduced unwittingly into science, by over-trusting the individual doctor or scientist's ability to see and state things objectively. Foucault roots this argument in the rediscovery of Kant, though his thought is significantly influenced by [[Nietzsche]] - that philosopher declaring the "death of God" in the 19th century, and the [[anti-humanism|anti-humanists]] proposing the "death of Man" in the 20th. === Knowledge ecology === {{main|Knowledge ecology}} '''Knowledge ecology''' is a concept originating from [[knowledge management]] and that aimed at "bridging the gap between the static data repositories of knowledge management and the dynamic, adaptive behavior of natural systems" <ref> {{cite journal | last=Pór | first=G. | year=2000 | title=Nurturing Systemic Wisdom through Knowledge Ecology | journal=The Systems Thinker | volume=11 | issue=8 | pages=1–5 }} </ref>, and in particular relying on the concept of interaction and [[emergence]]. Knowledge ecology, and its related concept [[information ecology]] has been elaborated by different academics and practitioners such as [[Thomas H. Davenport]] <ref> {{cite book | last=Davenport | first=Thomas H. | author-link=Thomas H.
