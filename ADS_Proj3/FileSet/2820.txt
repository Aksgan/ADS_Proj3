It was first profiled in [[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.09/scans.html?pg=7|title=Love and Money|first=Todd|last=Krieger|month=September|year=1995|publisher=Wired}}</ref> In 1998, Match.com was purchased by [[Cendant]]. A year later Match.com was purchased by [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]] (then still operating under the name TicketMaster). In late 1999, Match.com was moved to Dallas, Texas, to merge with another matching site, One & Only networks, that IAC/InterActiveCorp had purchased the same year. Between September 9, 2004, and April 24, 2007, [[Jim Safka]] was the Chief Executive Officer of Match.com. Thomas Enraght-Moony was the CEO from April, 2007 to February 19, 2009.<ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasenraghtmoony]</ref> On February 19, 2009, Match.com divested its European operations to Meetic. Following the divestment, Greg Blatt, an Executive Vice President and General Counsel of IAC/InterActiveCorp, was named CEO of Match.com.<ref>http://iac.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1645</ref> Mr. Blatt retains the title of EVP of IAC/InterActiveCorp but has stepped down as its General Counsel. On May 24, 2010, Match.com became the exclusive provider of online dating service for Yahoo! via the formation of a co-branded site, "Match.com on Yahoo!".<ref>http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/24/yahoo-finds-a-new-lover-in-match-com-dumps-personals/</ref> In November 2004, Guinness World Records recognized Match.com as the largest online dating site in the world. At the time, more than 42 million singles globally had registered with Match.com since its launch in 1995, and worldwide there were over 15 million members using the service. In late 2005, Match.com in the United States entered into a strategic partnership with [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] on a new US marketing campaign called "MindFindBind", a monthly subscription program that Match.com members can pay an extra fee to access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dating.about.com/od/sitereviews/fr/match.htm|title=Match.com Review|first=Bonny|last=Albo|publisher=About.com}}</ref> In December 2006, the layout of the United States Match.com site was redesigned, to go in line with the newly launched series of black and white TV advertisements in the US featuring Match.com members. It was announced in February 2009 that Match.com's European operations was sold to [[Meetic]] for 5 million Euros and a reported twenty-seven percent interest in the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2009/04/love-is-in-the-air.html|title=Love is In the Air|first=Mark|last=Brooks|month=April|year=2009|publisher=Online Personals Watch}}</ref> At the same time that this sale was announced, the current CEO Thomas Enraght-Mooney stepped down, while IAC's (Match.com's parent company) Executive VP and General Counsel, Greg Blatt, took his place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2009/02/iac-appoints-greg-blatt-ceo-of-matchcom.html|title=IAC Appoints Greg Blatt CEO of Match.com|first=Mark|last=Brooks|month=February|year=2009|publisher=Online Personals Watch}}</ref> Match.com competitors today include [[eHarmony]], [[Zoosk]], [[Plenty of Fish]], and [[SpeedDate.com]]. ==MatchLive and MatchTravel== <!-- this section was removed by someone in the Match.com's IP range according to Wikiscanner --> In 2002 and early 2003, Match.com's then CEO, Tim Sullivan, tried to expand Match.com reach by expanding into the local dating scene with a service called MatchLive. Daters would meet in a public location sponsored by Match.com. People would be involved in social activities and a form of [[speed dating]] together. The idea was scrapped by the parent company. Shortly afterwards, IAC fired Tim Sullivan as acting CEO, and laid off 30 people in the Dallas office involved with the MatchLive brand.<ref>[http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2004/09/13/daily3.html http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2004/09/13/daily3.html]</ref> The company stated that it planned to refocus its operation moving forward on on-line dating instead of hosting singles and speed-dating events. MatchTravel was an attempt about the same time as the MatchLive brand to offer discounts via the then sister company [[Expedia, Inc.]] to daters meeting on Match.com. The service was rescinded shortly afterward. ==Controversy== On November 10, 2005, a class action lawsuit was filed by Matthew Evans against Match.com in federal court in Los Angeles alleging that Match.com "secretly employs people as 'date bait' to send bogus enticing E-mails and to go on as many as 100 dates a month - or three a day - to keep customers ponying up." The suit has been repudiated by IAC as baseless. The suit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California on April 25, 2007.<ref>[http://corp.match.com/index/newscenter_release_detail.asp?auto_index=97 Welcome to Match.com Corporate Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Citation broken|date=May 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070222150633/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/367167p-312443c.html New York Daily News - Home - Call 'em Match.con<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A class-action lawsuit filed in June 2009 accuses Match.com of matching customers with people who are non-paying customers or who are not customers at all.

Cancellation can be done online or users must phone a call centre to cancel billing.
