special issue]<nowiki>[2]</nowiki> has focused particularly on the challenges of evaluating exploratory search, given the reduced assumptions that can be made about scenarios of use. In June 2008, the [[National Science Foundation]] sponsored an [http://www.ils.unc.edu/ISSS_workshop/ invitational workshop] to identify a research agenda for exploratory search and similar fields for the coming years. ==Research challenges== ===Important scenarios=== With the majority of research in the [[information retrieval]] community focusing on typical keyword search scenarios, one challenge for exploratory search is to further understand the scenarios of use for when keyword search is not sufficient. An example scenario, often used to motivate the research by [http://mspace.fm mSpace] states: if a user does not know much about classical music, how should they even begin to find a piece that they might like. ===Designing new interfaces=== With one of the motivations being to support users when keyword search is not enough, some research has focused on identifying alternative user interfaces and interaction models that support the user in different ways. An example is [[Faceted classification|faceted search]] which presents diverse category-style options to the user, so that they can choose from a list instead of guess a possible keyword query. Many of the [[human–computer information retrieval|interactive forms of search]], including [[faceted browser]]s, are being considered for their support of exploratory search conditions. Computational cognitive models of exploratory search have been developed to capture the cognitive complexities involved in exploratory search. Model-based dynamic presentation of information cues are proposed to facilitate exploratory search performance.<ref>Fu, W.-T., Kannampalill, T. G., & Kang, R. (2010). Facilitating exploratory search by model-based navigational cues. In Proceedings of the ACM International conference on Intelligent User Interface. 199-208. http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719970.1719998</ref> ===Evaluating interfaces=== As the tasks and goals involved with exploratory search are largely undefined or unpredictable, it is very hard to evaluate systems with the measures often used in information retrieval. Accuracy was typically used to show that a user had found a correct answer, but when the user is trying to summarize a domain of information, the ''correct'' answer is near impossible to identify, if not entirely subjective (for example: possible hotels to stay in Paris). In exploration, it is also arguable that spending more time (where time efficiency is typically desirable) researching a topic shows that a system provides increased support for investigation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, giving study participants a well specified task could immediately prevent them from exhibiting exploratory behavior. ===Models of exploratory search behavior=== There has been recent attempts to develop process model of exploratory search behavior, especially in social information system (e.g., see [[models of collaborative tagging]].<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Fu | first1 = Wai-Tat | title = The Microstructures of Social Tagging: A Rational Model | journal = Proceedings of the ACM 2008 conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work. | pages = 66–72 | date = April 2008 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1460600 }} </ref> .<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Fu | first1 = Wai-Tat | title = A Semantic Imitation Model of Social Tagging. | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE conference on Social Computing | pages = 66–72 | date = Aug 2009 | url = http://www.humanfactors.illinois.edu/Reports&PapersPDFs/IEEESocialcom09/A%20Semantic%20Imitation%20Model%20of%20Social%20Tag%20Choices%20(2).pdf }}</ref> The process model assumes that user-generated information cues, such as social tags, can act as navigational cues that facilitate exploration of information that others have found and shared with other users on a social information system (such as [[social bookmarking]] system). These models provided extension to existing process model of information search that characterizes information-seeking behavior in traditional fact-retrievals using search engines.<ref> {{Citation | last1 = Fu | first1 = Wai-Tat | last2 = Pirolli | first2 = Peter | title = SNIF-ACT: a cognitive model of user navigation on the world wide web | journal = Human-Computer Interaction | pages = 335–412 | year = 2007 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1466608 | volume = 22}}</ref><ref>Kitajima, M., Blackmon, M.
