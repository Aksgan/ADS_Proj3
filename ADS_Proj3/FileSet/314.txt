affect system resources: so it compromises Confidentiality. A Threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability. A threat can be either "intentional" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or "accidental" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an "act of God" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).<ref name=rfc2828/> A set of policies concerned with information security management, the [[ISMS|Information Security Management Systems]] (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to [[Risk management]] principles, the [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.<ref name=Vacca>{{cite book |last= Wright |first=Joe |authormask= |authorlink= |coauthors= Jim Harmening |firstn= |lastn= |authorn-link= |editor= |editorn-last=Vacca |editorn-first=John |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Computer and Information Security Handbook |trans_title= |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series=Morgan Kaufmann Pubblications |volume= |date= |origyear= |year=2009 |month= |publisher= Elsevier Inc |location= |language= |isbn= 978-0-12-374354-1 |oclc= |doi= |bibcode= |id= |page=257 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter=15 |trans_chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= }} </ref> An attack should led to a ''security incident'' i.e. a ''security event'' that involves a ''security violation''. In other words, a security-relevant system event in which the system's security policy is disobeyed or otherwise breached. The overall picture represents the [[Risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] of the risk scenario.<ref>[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required)]</ref> An organization should make steps to detect, classify and manage security incidents. The first logical step is to set up an [[Incident response plan]] and eventually a [[Computer emergency response team]]. In order to detect attacks, a number of [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] can be set up at organizational, procedural and technical levels. [[Computer emergency response team]], [[Information technology security audit]] and [[Intrusion detection system]] are example of these.<ref name=Vacca1>{{cite book |last= Caballero |first=Albert |authormask= |authorlink= |coauthors= |firstn= |lastn= |authorn-link= |editor= |editorn-last=Vacca |editorn-first=John |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Computer and Information Security Handbook |trans_title= |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series=Morgan Kaufmann Pubblications |volume= |date= |origyear= |year=2009 |month= |publisher= Elsevier Inc |location= |language= |isbn= 978-0-12-374354-1 |oclc= |doi= |bibcode= |id= |page=225 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter=14 |trans_chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= }} </ref> == Types of attacks == An attack usually is perpetrated by someone with bad intentions: [[Hacker (computer security)|Black hatted]] attacks falls in this category, while other perform [[Penetration test]]ing on an organization information system to find out if all foreseen controls are in place.<br /> The attacks can be classified according to their origin: i.e. if it is conducted using one or more computers: in the last case is called a distributed attack. [[Botnet]] are used to conduct distributed attacks. <br /> Other classifications are according to the procedures used or the type of vulnerabilities exploited: attacks can be concentrated on network mechanisms or host features. <br /> Some attacks are physical: i.e. theft or damage of computers and other equipments. Other are logical, trying to force changes in the logic used by computers or network protocols in order to achieve unforeseen (by the original designer) result but useful for the attacker. The general term used to describe the category of software used to logically attacking computers is called [[malware]] The following is a partial short list of attacks: * Passive ** Network *** [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] *** [[Port scanner]] *** [[Idle scan]] * Active ** [[Denial-of-service attack]] ** [[Spoofing attack|Spoofing]] ** Network *** [[Man in the middle]] *** [[ARP poisoning]] *** [[Ping flood]] *** [[Ping of death]] *** [[Smurf attack]] ** Host *** [[Buffer overflow]] *** [[Heap overflow]] *** [[Format string attack]] == Consequence of a potential attack == A whole industry is working trying to minimize the likelihood and the consequence of an information attack.
