All sheep parameters and movies are distributed under the [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution license]] and automatically downloaded by the screen saver. The screensaver was created and released as [[Free Software]] by [[Scott Draves]] in 1999 and continues to be developed by him and a team of about five engineers. The beta version differs from the old versions. It has a new logo, higher quality sheep and other features. ==See also== *[[List of distributed computing projects]] *[[Software art]] *[[Evolutionary art]] ==References== {{reflist}} ;Notes {{Refbegin}} * {{cite conference|title=The Electric Sheep Screen-Saver: A Case Study in Aesthetic Evolution|format=pdf|first=Scott|last=Draves|authorlink=Scott Draves|url=http://draves.org/evomusart05/|booktitle=Applications of Evolutionary Computing, the proceedings of EvoMusArt05|conference=EvoMusArt05|conferenceurl=http://evonet.lri.fr/eurogp2005/?page=evomusart|date=March 31, 2005}} -- Technical paper about the project. {{Refend}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Electric Sheep}} * [http://electricsheep.org/ The Electric Sheep project's main page] * [http://code.google.com/p/electricsheep/ Project wiki, downloads, and source code] [[Category:Distributed computing projects]] [[Category:Screensavers]] [[Category:Computer art]] [[cs:Electric Sheep]] [[de:Electric Sheep]] [[it:Electric Sheep]] [[ja:Electric Sheep]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11844</id> <title>Electro Selective Pattern</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=November 2008}} Digital '''ESP-metering''' mode is used by some [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] cameras (f.i. [[Olympus C-8080 Wide Zoom]]). It measures the brightness of the center of the subject and the surrounding area separately. Digital '''''i ESP-metering''''' (intelligent ESP) is a focusing application: even when the subject is not in the center of the screen, focusing is possible; the AF target mark moves to the focus position. It gives better skin colours too. ''Center-weighted metering'' mode meters the brightness over a wide emphasis on the center of the screen. This method is used when the surrounding area brightness may not affect the picture. ''Spot-metering'' mode meters within the target area, the subject can be shot with optimal exposure regardless of the background light. {{photo-stub}} [[Category:Digital photography]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11845</id> <title>Electro stimulation</title> <text>'''Electro-stimulation''' can be performed in the context of: * [[Bioelectromagnetics]] ** [[Cranial electrotherapy stimulation]] ** [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] * [[Electrical muscle stimulation]] * [[animal husbandry]] as part of the [[artificial insemination]] process * [[Erotic electrostimulation]] - Sometimes a form of [[BDSM]] [[Category:Neurotechnology]] {{disambig}} [[it:Elettrostimolazione]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11846</id> <title>Electroadhesion</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=September 2008}} '''Electroadhesion''' is the term given to the [[electrostatic]] effect of astriction between two surfaces subjected to an [[electrical field]].

All received articles are thoroughly peer reviewed by a board of internationally recognized experts.
