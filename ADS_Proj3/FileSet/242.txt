Informally, Kayne's theory states that if a nonterminal category A c-commands another nonterminal category B, all the terminal nodes dominated by A must precede all of the terminal nodes dominated by B (this statement is commonly referred to as the "Linear Correspondence Axiom" or LCA). Moreover, this principle must suffice to establish a ''complete'' and ''consistent'' ordering of all terminal nodes &mdash; if it cannot consistently order all of the terminal nodes in a tree, the tree is illicit. Consider the following tree: <!-- NOT SURE IF THIS IS REALLY MUCH MORE INFORMATIVE SINCE IT'S STILL QUITE INFORMAL The technical machinery goes as follows: In a tree with a set of pairs of categories, {<A-i, B-i>}, such that for all i, A-i asymmetrically c-commands B-i, the set of terminals {a-1, a-2, a-3 ... a-n} dominated by A-i precedes the terminals {b-1, b-2, b-3 ... b-n} dominated by B-i. Crucially, a category consists of all segments of a maximal projection. --> <center>[[Image:Antisymmetry php basic tree structure.png]]</center> (S and S' may either be simplex structures like BP, or complex structures with specifers and complements like CP.) In this tree, the set of pairs of nonterminal categories such that the first member of the pair asymmetrically c-commands the second member is as follows: {<BP, A>, <BP, CP>, <A, CP>}. This gives rise to the total ordering: <b, a, c>. As a result, there is no right adjunction, and hence in practice no rightward movement either.<ref>Since any rightward movement must also be downward movement if there are no rightward specifiers or right adjunction, and downward movement is generally assumed to be illicit.</ref> Furthermore, the underlying order must be specifier-head-complement. ==Derivation of X-bar theory== The example tree in the [[Antisymmetry#Asymmetric c-command|first section]] of this article is in accordance with [[X-bar theory]] (with the exception that [Spec,CP] is treated as an adjunct). It can be seen that removing any of the structure in the tree (e.g. deleting the C dominating the 'c' terminal, so that the complement of A is [CP c]) will destroy the asymmetric c-command relations necessary for linearly ordering the terminals of the tree. ==The universal order== Kayne notes that his theory permits either a universal specifier-head-complement order or a universal complement-head-specifier order, depending on whether asymmetric c-command establishes precedence or subsequence (S-H-C results from precedence) (pp. 35–36)<ref name="antisymmetry" /> He argues that there are good empirical grounds for preferring S-H-C as the universal underlying order, since the [[linguistic typology|typologically]] most widely attested order is for specifiers to precede heads and complements (though the order of heads and complements themselves is relatively free). He further argues that a movement approach to deriving non S-H-C orders is appropriate, since it derives asymmetries in typology (such as the fact that "verb second" languages such as [[German language|German]] are not mirrored by any known "verb second-from-last" languages). ==Derived orders: the case of Japanese wh-questions== Perhaps the biggest challenge for antisymmetry is to explain the wide variety of different surface orders across languages. Any deviation from Spec-Head-Comp order (which implies overall Subject-Verb-Object order, if objects are complements) must be explained by movement. Kayne argues that in some cases, the need for extra movements (previously unnecessary because different underlying orders were assumed for different languages) can actually explain some mysterious typological generalizations. His explanation for the lack of [[wh-movement]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is the most striking example of this. From the mid-1980s onwards, the standard analysis of wh-movement involved the wh-phrase moving leftward to a position on the left edge of the clause called [Spec,CP] (i.e., the specifier of the CP phrase). Thus, a derivation of the English question ''What did John buy?'' would proceed roughly as follows: :[CP {Spec,CP position} John did buy what] ::''wh-movement'' → :[CP What did John buy] The Japanese equivalent of this sentence is as follows<ref>{{cite book|title=Introducing Transformational Grammar (Second Edition)|author=Jamal Ouhalla|year=1999|publisher=Arnold/Oxford University Press}} (See p. 461 for the Japanese example.)</ref> (note the lack of wh-movement): : {| border="0" cellspacing="7" |----- | John-wa || nani-o || kaimasita || ka |----- | John-''topic_marker'' | what-''[[accusative case|accusative]]'' | bought || ''question_particle'' |} Japanese has an overt "question particle" (''ka''), which appears at the end of the sentence in questions. It is generally assumed that languages such as English have a "covert" (i.e. phonologically null) equivalent of this particle in the 'C' position of the clause &mdash; the position just to the right of [Spec,CP]. This particle is overtly realised in English by movement of an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] to C (in the case of the example above, by movement of ''did'' to C). Why is it that this particle is on the left edge of the clause in English, but on the right edge in Japanese? Kayne suggests that in Japanese, the ''whole of the clause'' (apart from the question particle in C) has moved to the [Spec,CP] position. So, the structure for the Japanese example above is something like the following: :[CP [John-wa nani-o kaimasita] [[C ka]] Now it is clear why Japanese does not have wh-movement &mdash; the [Spec,CP] position is already filled, so no wh-phrase can move to it. We therefore predict a seemingly obscure relationship between surface word order and the possibility of wh-movement. A possible alternative to the antisymmetric explanation could be based on the difficulty of parsing languages with rightward movement.<ref>Neeleman, Ad & Peter Ackema (2002).
