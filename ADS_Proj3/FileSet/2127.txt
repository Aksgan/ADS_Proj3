the intended ECC operation, e.g. key agreement protocols such as [[ECDH]] and [[ECMQV]], or signing such as [[ECDSA]]. The operation will fail if the certificate is invalid. Thus ECQV is regarded as an implicit validation scheme. Computing the public key is very fast, much faster than a public key operation. ==Generating implicit certificates== Initially the elliptic curve parameters must be agreed upon. We define <math>G \,</math> as a generating point of order <math>n \,</math>. The [[Certificate Authority]] (CA) will have private key <math>c \,</math> and public key <math>Q_{CA} = cG \,</math>. Alice will be the user who requests the implicit certificate from the CA. # Alice generates a random integer <math>\alpha \,</math> and computes <math>\alpha\,G \,</math> and sends that to the CA. The CA does all the rest. # CA Select a random integer <math>k \,</math> from <math>[1, n-1] \,</math> and computes <math>kG \,</math>. # CA computes <math>\gamma = \alpha \,G + kG \,</math> (this is the implicit certificate) # CA computes <math>e = \textrm{H}(\gamma \parallel \textrm{ID}_A) \,</math>, where <math>\textrm{H} \,</math> is a [[cryptographic hash function]], such as [[SHA]] and <math> \textrm{ID}_A \,</math> is Alice's identifying information. # CA computes <math>s = ek + c \pmod{n} \,</math> # CA sends <math>(s, \gamma) \,</math> to Alice Alice’s private key is <math>a = e\alpha + s \pmod{n} \,</math> Alice’s public key is <math>Q_A = e\gamma + Q_{CA} \,</math> ==Computing the public-key from the implicit certificate== Computing Alice's public key <math>Q_A \,</math> can be computed by any third party provided they know <math>\gamma \,</math>, <math>\textrm{ID}_A \,</math> and <math>Q_{CA} \,</math>. Note that the size of the implicit certificate <math>\gamma \,</math> is the same size as Alice's public key <math>Q_{A} \,</math>. ==Security== A security proof for ECQV has been published. ==References== * Darrel Hankerson, Alfred Menezes and Scott Vanstone, ''Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Springer'', Springer, 2004. * Certicom Research, [http://www.secg.org/?action=secg,docs_draft] ''Standards for efficient cryptography, SEC 4: Elliptic Curve Cryptography'', Draft document , November 11, 2006. * Certicom.com, [http://www.certicom.com/index.php?action=res,cc&issue=2-2&&article=3] ''Explaining Implicit Certificates'', Code and Cipher Vol. 2, no. 2 * Leon Pintsov and Scott Vanstone, ''Postal Revenue Collection in the Digital Age'', Financial Cryptography 2000, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1962, pp. 105-120, Springer, February 2000. * Daniel R.

For example, an [[explicit repetition]] is when we review the material before an exam. An implicit repetition is when we suddenly recall some fact on the way to school. We remember our name or events from childhood via implicit repetition. This means we do not need to explicitly sit down to a textbook and review those events to be sure they do not get forgotten. Unfortunately, implicit repetition cannot be used to ensure we do not forget things we learn at school. This is why explicit review of material is needed. {{DEFAULTSORT:Implicit Repetition}} [[Category:Learning]] {{Psych-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>18025</id> <title>Impossibility of a gambling system</title> <text>[[File:Marche aleatoire 3d bis.JPG|thumb|A [[random walk]] on a cubic three dimensional lattice.]] The principle of the '''impossibility of a gambling system''' is a concept in [[probability]] and [[randomness]]. It states that in a random sequence, the selection of sub-sequences does not change the probability of specific elements. Although the concept had been vaguely discussed in various forms for some time, it is generally attributed to [[Richard von Mises]], who used the term ''collective'' rather than sequence.<ref>''Probability, Statistics and Truth'' by Richard von Mises 1928/1981 Dover, ISBN 0486242145 page 25</ref><ref>''Counting for something: statistical principles and personalities'' by William Stanley Peters 1986 ISBN 0387963642 page 3</ref> Intuitively speaking, the principle states that it is not possible to select a sub-sequence of a [[random sequence]] in a way to improve the odds for a specific event. For instance, if a coin toss sequence is random with equal and independent 50/50 chances for heads and tails, then betting on heads every 3rd, 7th, or 21st toss, etc. does not change the odds of winning in the long run. Richard von Mises likened the principle of the impossibility of a gambling system to the principle of the [[conservation of energy]], a law that can not be proven, but has held true in repeated experiments.<ref>''The philosophy of Karl Popper'' by Herbert Keuth ISBN 0521548306 page 171</ref> [[Richard von Mises]] defined an infinite sequence of zeros and ones as a [[random sequence]] if it is not biased by having the ''frequency stability property'' i.e. the frequency of zeros goes to 1/2 and every sub-sequence we can select from it by a "proper" method of selection is also not biased.<ref>Laurant Bienvenu "Kolmogorov Loveland Stochastocity" in STACS 2007: 24th Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science by Wolfgang Thomas ISBN 3540709177 page 260</ref> The sub-sequence selection criterion imposed by von Mises is important, because although 0101010101... is not biased, by selecting the odd positions, we get 000000... which is not random. Von Mises never totally formalized his definition of a proper selection rule for sub-sequences, but in 1940 [[Alonzo Church]] defined it as any [[recursive function]] which having read the first N elements of the sequence decides if it wants to select element number N+1. Church was a pioneer in the field of computable functions, and the definition he made relied on the [[Church Turing Thesis]] for computability.<ref>[[Alonzo Church]], "On the Concept of Random Sequence," Bull.
