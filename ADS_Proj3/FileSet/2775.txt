imaging</title> <text>'''Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging''' is a [[noninvasive]] [[Medical imaging|imaging]] method that provides information about [[cell (biology)|cellular]] activity ([[metabolic]] information). It is used along with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] ([[MRI]]) which provides information about the shape and size of the [[tumor]] ([[spatial]] information). Also called [[1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging]] and [[proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging]]. == External links == *[http://www.cancer.gov/Templates/db_alpha.aspx?CdrID=269422 Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging] entry in the public domain NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms {{NCI-cancer-dict}} [[Category:Magnetic resonance imaging]] [[Category:Medical imaging]] [[Category:Radiology]] [[Category:Oncology]] {{oncology-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>23270</id> <title>Magnetogastrography</title> <text>{{Expert-subject|Physics|date=September 2008}} {{Expert-subject|Medicine|date=September 2008}} '''Magnetogastrography''' is the science of recording magnetogastrograms (MGGs). Magnetogastrograms are recordings of magnetic fields resulting from electrical activity from the stomach and can be considered similar to [[electrocardiograms]].

The term originally referred to the large cabinets that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], on -line edition, ''mainframe, n''</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Ebbers | first = Mike | last2 = O’Brien | first2 = W. | last3 = Ogden | first3 = B. | title = Introduction to the New Mainframe: z/OS Basics | publisher = IBM International Technical Support Organization | year = 2006 | format = pdf | url = http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/zoslib/pdf/zosbasic.pdf | accessdate = 2007-06-01 }}</ref> Later the term was used to distinguish high-end commercial machines from less powerful units. Most large-scale computer system architectures were firmly established in the 1960s and most large computers were based on architecture established during that era up until the advent of Web servers in the 1990s. (The first Web server running anywhere outside Switzerland ran on an IBM mainframe at Stanford University as early as 1991. See [[History of the World Wide Web]] for details.) There were several [[minicomputer]] operating systems and architectures that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, but minicomputers are generally not considered mainframes. ([[UNIX]] arose as a minicomputer operating system; Unix has scaled up over the years to acquire some mainframe characteristics{{cn|date=January 2011}}.) Many defining characteristics of "mainframe" were established in the 1960s, but those characteristics continue to expand and evolve to the present day. == Description == Modern mainframe computers have abilities not so much defined by their single task computational speed (usually defined as MIPS — Millions of Instructions Per Second) as by their redundant internal engineering and resulting high reliability and security, extensive input-output facilities, strict [[backward compatibility]] with older software, and high utilization rates to support massive throughput. These machines often run for years without interruption, with repairs and hardware upgrades taking place during normal operation. Software upgrades are only non-disruptive when using facilities such as IBM's z/OS and [[IBM Parallel Sysplex|Parallel Sysplex]], with workload sharing so one system can take over another's application while it is being refreshed. More recently, there are several IBM mainframe installations that have delivered over a decade of continuous business service as of 2007, with hardware upgrades not interrupting service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Mainframes are defined by high availability, one of the main reasons for their longevity, because they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic. The term [[Reliability, Availability and Serviceability]] (RAS) is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers. Proper planning (and implementation) is required to exploit these features. In the 1960s, most mainframes had no interactive interface. They accepted sets of [[punched cards]], paper tape, and/or magnetic tape and operated solely in [[batch processing|batch]] mode to support [[back office]] functions, such as customer billing. [[Teletype]] devices were also common, at least for system operators. By the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user interfaces and operated as [[timesharing]] computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through specialized [[Computer terminal|terminals]] or, later, from [[personal computer]]s equipped with [[terminal emulation]] software. Many mainframes supported graphical terminals (and terminal emulation) but not graphical user interfaces by the 1980s, but end user computing was largely obsoleted in the 1990s by the personal computer. Nowadays most mainframes have partially or entirely phased out classic terminal access for end-users in favor of Web user interfaces. Developers and operational staff typically continue to use terminals or terminal emulators.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Historically, mainframes acquired their name in part because of their substantial size, and because of requirements for specialized heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]), and electrical power. Those requirements ended by the mid-1990s with [[CMOS]] mainframe designs replacing the older [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] technology. IBM claims its newer mainframes can reduce data center energy costs for power and cooling, and that they can reduce physical space requirements compared to [[server farms]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Get the facts on IBM vs the Competition- The facts about IBM System z "mainframe" |publisher=IBM |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/migratetoibm/getthefacts/mainframe.html#4}}</ref> == Characteristics== Nearly all mainframes have the ability to run (or host) multiple operating systems, and thereby operate not as a single computer but as a number of [[virtual machine]]s.
