Rejewski, the principal Polish source, wrote in a posthumously published 1980 paper that at [[Cadix]] "We worked on other ciphers, no longer on Enigma." ([[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 270.) Colonel [[Stefan Mayer]] of Polish Intelligence, however, mentioned the Poles breaking "interesting [machine-enciphered messages] from [Germany's 1941] [[Balkan]] campaign coming [in over] the 'Luftwaffe' network..." ([[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 116.) And French intelligence Gen. [[Gustave Bertrand]] wrote of Enigma having been read at Cadix. ([[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 117.) Tadeusz Lisicki, Rejewski's and Zygalski's immediate chief in wartime England but sometimes a dubious source, wrote in 1982 that "Rejewski in [a letter] conceded that Bertrand was doubtless right that at Cadix they had read Enigma, and that the number given by Bertrand, of 673 [Wehrmacht] telegrams, was correct.... The British did not send keys to Cadix; these were found using various tricks such as the sillies [and] [[Herivel tip]] described by [[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]], [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|Knox]]'s method, as well as others that Rejewski no longer remembered."

(The third mathematician, Jerzy Różycki, had perished, while returning in 1942 to France from a tour of duty in Algeria, in the sinking of the passenger ship ''Lamoricière''.) In Britain, Rejewski and Zygalski were inducted into the Polish Army as privates (they would eventually be promoted to lieutenant) and put to work breaking German ''[[SS]]'' and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]'' hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in [[Boxmoor]]. Because of having been in occupied France, it was considered too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 148–55, 205–9</ref> ===Operating shortcomings=== Apart from some less-than-ideal inherent characteristics of the Enigma, in practice the machine's greatest weakness was the way that it was used. The basic principle of this sort of enciphering machine is that it should deliver a very long stream of transformations that is difficult for a cryptanalyst to predict. Some of the instructions to operators, however, and their sloppy habits, had the opposite effect. Without these operating shortcomings, Enigma would not have been broken. The set of shortcomings that the Polish cryptanalysts exploited to such great effect included the following: * Producing an early Enigma training manual containing an example of plaintext and its genuine ciphertext, together with the relevant message key. When Rejewski was given this in December 1932, it "made [his reconstruction of the [[Enigma machine]]] somewhat easier".<ref name="Rejewski84P243"/> * Repetition of the message key as described in [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Early indicator procedures|early indicator procedures]], above. (This helped in Rejewski's [[Marian Rejewski#Solving Enigma's wiring|solving Enigma's wiring]] in 1932, and was continued until May 1940.) * Repeatedly using the same stereotypical expressions in messages, an early example of what Bletchley Park would later term [[crib (cryptanalysis)|cribs]]. Rejewski wrote that "... we relied on the fact that the greater number of messages began with the letters ''ANX''—German for "to", followed by ''X'' as a spacer".<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 c) p. 243–44</ref> * The use of easily-guessed keys such as ''AAA'' or ''BBB'', or sequences that reflected the layout of the Enigma keyboard, such as "three [typing] keys that stand next to each other [o]r diagonally [from each other]..."<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 235</ref> Sometimes, with multi-part messages, the operator would not enter a key for a subsequent part of a message, merely leaving the rotors as they were at the end of the previous part, to become the message key for the next part.<ref>>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 235 </ref> At Bletchley Park such occurrences were called ''cillies''<ref name="David Kahn 1991 p. 113">[[David Kahn (writer)|Kahn]] (1991) p. 113 </ref><ref>[[Hugh Sebag-Montefiore|Sebag-Montefiore]] (2004) p. 92 </ref> Cillies in the operation of the four-rotor ''Abwehr'' Enigma included four-letter names and German obscenities. * Having only three different rotors for the three positions in the scrambler. (This continued until December 1938, when it was increased to five and then eight for naval traffic in 1940.) * Using only six plugboard leads, leaving 14
