of goals on the basis of objectives and keeping in the resources. ===What should a plan be?=== A plan should be a realistic view of the expectations. Depending upon the activities, a plan can be long range, intermediate range or short range. It is the framework within which it must operate. For management seeking external support, the plan is the most important document and key to growth. Preparation of a comprehensive plan will not guarantee success, but lack of a sound plan will almost certainly ensure failure. Planning can be summarized in 3 easy steps: 1. choosing a destination, 2. evaluating alternative routes, and 3. deciding the specific course of your plan. <ref>Barron's Management book fourth edition, Authors: Patrick J. montana and Bruce H. Charnov</ref> ===Purpose of a plan=== Just as no two organizations are alike, so also their plans. It is therefore important to prepare a plan keeping in view the necessities of the enterprise. A plan is an important aspect of business. It serves the following three critical functions: * Helps management to clarify, focus, and research their business's or project's development and prospects. * Provides a considered and logical framework within which a business can develop and pursue business strategies over the next three to five years. * Offers a benchmark against which actual performance can be measured and reviewed. ===Importance of the planning process=== A plan can play a vital role in helping to avoid mistakes or recognize hidden opportunities. Preparing a satisfactory plan of the organization is essential. The planning know the business and that they have thought through its development in terms of products, management, finances, and most importantly, markets and competition. Planning helps in forecasting the future, makes the future visible to some extent. It bridges between where we are and where we want to go. Planning is looking ahead. ==Types of plans or planning== * [[Architectural planning]] * [[Business plan]] * [[Comprehensive planning]] * [[Economic planning]] * [[Enterprise Architecture Planning]] * [[Event Planning and Production]] * [[Family planning]] * [[Financial planning]] * [[Land use planning]] * [[Life planning]] * [[Marketing plan]] * [[Network resource planning]] * [[Strategic planning]] * [[Succession planning]] * [[Urban planning]] * [[Operational planning]] * [[Contingency planning]] * [[purpose or mission]] * [[objective or goals]] * [[policies]] * [[procedures]] * [[programs]] * [[roles]] * [[budgets]] ==Objectives and policies== ===The objectives=== The objectives are general parts of the planning process. They are the end-results towards which all business activities are directed. They are needed in every aspect where performance and result directly and vitally affect the survival and success of the firm. In other words, the objective of the firm justifies its existence. [[Newman]] and [[Summer]] stated, "For managerial purposes, it is useful to think of objectives as the results we want to achieve. Objective covers firm's long-range plans specific departmental goals and short-term individual assignment also." ===The policies=== Policies are specific guidelines and constraints for managerial thinking on decision-making and action.

The planning helps to achieve these goals or target by using the available time and resources. To minimize the timing and resources also require proper planning. The concept of planning is to identify what the organization wants to do by using the four questions which are "where are we today in terms of our business or strategy planning? Where are we going? Where do we want to go? How are we going to get there?..."<ref>Dalziel, Murray, and Stephen C. Schoonover. "Changing Ways: A Practical Tool for Implementing Change Within Organizations."
