is characterized by inductance and capacitance integrated in one element.<ref>Dzhankhotov V., ''Hybrid LC filter for power electronic drives: Theory and Implementation'', 2009</ref> ==== L filter ==== An L filter consists of two reactive elements, one in series and one in parallel. ==== T and π filters ==== {{main|Capacitor-input filter}} [[File:Lowpass Pi Filter.svg|thumb|250px|left|Low-pass π filter]] [[File:Highpass T Filter.svg|thumb|250px|right|High-pass T filter]] Three-element filters can have a 'T' or 'π' topology and in either geometries, a [[low-pass]], [[high-pass]], [[band-pass]], or [[band-stop]] characteristic is possible. The components can be chosen symmetric or not, depending on the required frequency characteristics. The high-pass T filter in the illustration, has a very low impedance at high frequencies, and a very high impedance at low frequencies. That means that it can be inserted in a transmission line, resulting in the high frequencies being passed and low frequencies being reflected. Likewise, for the illustrated low-pass π filter, the circuit can be connected to a transmission line, transmitting low frequencies and reflecting high frequencies. Using [[m-derived filter]] sections with correct termination impedances, the input impedance can be reasonably constant in the pass band.<ref>The American Radio Relay League, Inc.: "The ARRL Handbook, 1968" page 50</ref> <br style="clear:both" /> ====Multiple element types==== Multiple element filters are usually constructed as a [[ladder network]]. These can be seen as a continuation of the L,T and π designs of filters. More elements are needed when it is desired to improve some parameter of the filter such as stop-band rejection or slope of transition from pass-band to stop-band. ===Active filters=== [[Active filter]]s are implemented using a combination of passive and active (amplifying) components, and require an outside power source. [[Operational amplifier]]s are frequently used in active filter designs. These can have high [[Q factor]], and can achieve [[Electrical resonance|resonance]] without the use of inductors. However, their upper frequency limit is limited by the bandwidth of the amplifiers used. ===Digital filters=== {{main|digital filter}} [[File:FIR Filter General.svg|frame|A general finite impulse response filter with ''n'' stages, each with an independent delay, ''d''<sub>i</sub> and amplification gain, ''a''<sub>i</sub>.]] [[Digital signal processing]] allows the inexpensive construction of a wide variety of filters. The signal is sampled and an [[analog-to-digital converter]] turns the signal into a stream of numbers. A computer program running on a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] or a specialized [[digital signal processor|DSP]] (or less often running on a hardware implementation of the [[algorithm]]) calculates an output number stream. This output can be converted to a signal by passing it through a [[digital-to-analog converter]]. There are problems with noise introduced by the conversions, but these can be controlled and limited for many useful filters. Due to the sampling involved, the input signal must be of limited frequency content or [[aliasing]] will occur. ===Other filter technologies=== ====Quartz filters and piezoelectrics==== {{See also|Mechanical filter}} In the late 1930s, engineers realized that small mechanical systems made of rigid materials such as [[quartz]] would acoustically resonate at radio frequencies, i.e. from audible frequencies ([[sound]]) up to several hundred megahertz. Some early resonators were made of [[steel]], but quartz quickly became favored. The biggest advantage of quartz is that it is [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]]. This means that quartz resonators can directly convert their own mechanical motion into electrical signals. Quartz also has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion which means that quartz resonators can produce stable frequencies over a wide temperature range. [[Crystal oscillator|Quartz crystal]] filters have much higher quality factors than LCR filters. When higher stabilities are required, the crystals and their driving circuits may be mounted in a "[[crystal oven]]" to control the temperature. For very narrow band filters, sometimes several crystals are operated in series. Engineers realized that a large number of crystals could be collapsed into a single component, by mounting comb-shaped evaporations of metal on a quartz crystal. In this scheme, a "tapped [[analog delay line|delay line]]" reinforces the desired frequencies as the sound waves flow across the surface of the quartz crystal. The tapped delay line has become a general scheme of making high-''Q'' filters in many different ways. ====SAW filters==== SAW ([[surface acoustic wave]]) filters are [[electromechanical]] devices commonly used in [[radio frequency]] applications. Electrical signals are converted to a mechanical wave in a device constructed of a [[piezoelectric]] crystal or ceramic; this wave is delayed as it propagates across the device, before being converted back to an electrical signal by further [[electrode]]s. The delayed outputs are recombined to produce a direct analog implementation of a [[finite impulse response]] filter. This hybrid filtering technique is also found in an [[analog sampled filter]]. SAW filters are limited to frequencies up to 3 GHz. ====BAW filters==== BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) filters are [[electromechanical]] devices. BAW filters can implement ladder or lattice filters. BAW filters typically operate at frequencies from around 2 to around 16 GHz, and may be smaller or thinner than equivalent SAW filters. Two main variants of BAW filters are making their way into devices, [[Thin film bulk acoustic resonator]] or FBAR and Solid Mounted Bulk Acoustic Resonators. ====Garnet filters==== {{main|Yttrium iron garnet filter}} Another method of filtering, at [[microwave]] frequencies from 800 MHz to about 5 GHz, is to use a synthetic [[single crystal]] [[yttrium iron garnet]] sphere made of a chemical combination of [[yttrium]] and [[iron]] ('''YIGF''', or '''yttrium iron garnet filter'''). The garnet sits on a strip of metal driven by a [[transistor]], and a small loop [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] touches the top of the sphere. An [[electromagnet]] changes the frequency that the garnet will pass. The advantage of this method is that the garnet can be tuned over a very wide frequency by varying the strength of the [[magnetic field]]. ====Atomic filters==== For even higher frequencies and greater precision, the vibrations of atoms must be used. [[Atomic clock]]s use [[caesium]] [[maser]]s as ultra-high ''Q'' filters to stabilize their primary oscillators. Another method, used at high, fixed frequencies with very weak radio signals, is to use a [[ruby]] maser tapped delay line. == The transfer function == :''see also [[Filter (signal processing)]] for further analysis'' The [[transfer function]] <math>\
