only implemented in some countries in North America, the Caribbean and Latin America. * The next digits represent the mobile station identification number. Normally there will be 10 digits but would be fewer in the case of a 3 digit MNC or if national regulations indicate that the total length of the IMSI should be less than 15 digits. === Authentication key (K<sub>i</sub>)=== The K<sub>i</sub> is a 128-bit value used in authenticating the SIMs on the mobile network. Each SIM holds a unique K<sub>i</sub> assigned to it by the operator during the personalization process. The K<sub>i</sub> is also stored on a database (known as [[Authentication Center]] or AuC) on the carrier's network. The SIM card is designed not to allow the K<sub>i</sub> to be obtained using the [[(U)SIM Interface|smart-card interface]]. Instead, the SIM card provides a function, ''Run GSM Algorithm'', that allows the phone to pass data to the SIM card to be signed with the K<sub>i</sub>. This, by design, makes usage of the SIM card mandatory unless the K<sub>i</sub> can be extracted from the SIM card, or the carrier is willing to reveal the K<sub>i</sub>. In practice, the GSM cryptographic algorithm for computing SRES_2 (see step 4, below) from the K<sub>i</sub> has certain vulnerabilities {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} which can allow the extraction of the K<sub>i</sub> from a SIM card and the making of a [[SIM cloning|duplicate SIM card]]. ==== Authentication process==== # When the Mobile Equipment starts up, it obtains the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) from the SIM card, and passes this to the mobile operator requesting access and authentication. The Mobile Equipment may have to pass a PIN to the SIM card before the SIM card will reveal this information. # The operator network searches its database for the incoming IMSI and its associated K<sub>i</sub>. # The operator network then generates a Random Number (RAND, which is a [[cryptographic nonce|nonce]]) and signs it with the K<sub>i</sub> associated with the IMSI (and stored on the SIM card), computing another number known as Signed Response 1 (SRES_1). # The operator network then sends the RAND to the Mobile Equipment, which passes it to the SIM card. The SIM card signs it with its K<sub>i</sub>, producing SRES_2 which it gives to the Mobile Equipment along with encryption key K<sub>c</sub>. The Mobile Equipment passes SRES_2 on to the operator network. # The operator network then compares its computed SRES_1 with the computed SRES_2 that the Mobile Equipment returned. If the two numbers match the SIM is authenticated and the Mobile Equipment is granted access to the operator's network. K<sub>c</sub> is used to encrypt all further communications between the Mobile Equipment and the network. === Location area identity === The SIM stores network state information, which is received from the [[Location Area Identity]] (LAI). Operator networks are divided into Location Areas, each having a unique LAI number. When the device changes locations, it stores the new LAI to the SIM and sends it back to the operator network with its new location. If the device is power cycled, it will take data off the SIM, and search for the previous LAI. This saves time by avoiding having to search the whole list of frequencies that the telephone normally would. === SMS messages and contacts === Most SIM cards will orthogonally store a number of SMS messages and phone book contacts. The contacts are stored in simple 'Name and number' pairs - entries containing multiple phone numbers and additional phone numbers will usually not be stored on the SIM card. When a user tries to copy such entries to a SIM the handset's software will break them up into multiple entries, discarding any information that isn't a phone number. The number of contacts and messages stored depends on the SIM; early models would store as few as 5 messages and 20 contacts while modern SIM cards can usually store over 250 contacts. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} === Universal subscriber identity module {{Anchor|USIM}} === [[Image:USIM bluefish technologies.jpg|thumb|right|A 64K UICC in its larger carrier card]] A Universal Subscriber Identity Module is an application for [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] mobile telephony running on a [[UICC]] [[smart card]] which is inserted in a [[3G]] mobile phone. There is a common misconception to call the [[UICC]] itself a USIM, but the USIM is merely a logical entity on the physical card. It stores user subscriber information, authentication information and provides [[data storage device|storage]] space for [[Short message service|text messages]] and phone book contacts. The phone book on a UICC has been greatly enhanced. For authentication purposes, the USIM stores a long-term [[pre-shared key|pre-shared secret key]] K, which is shared with the Authentication Center (AuC) in the network. The USIM also verifies a sequence number that must be within a range using a window mechanism to avoid replay attacks, and is in charge of generating the session keys CK and IK to be used in the confidentiality and integrity algorithms of the [[KASUMI (block cipher)|KASUMI]] block cipher in [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]. The equivalent of USIM on [[GSM]] networks is SIM, and on [[CDMA]] networks it is [[CDMA Subscriber Identify Module|CSIM]]. == Japan== [[Japan]]'s 2G [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]] system (which will be completely shut down by 2012; [[SoftBank Mobile]] has already shut down PDC from March 31, 2010) also specifies a SIM, but this has never been implemented commercially. The specification of the interface between the Mobile Equipment and the SIM is given in the [[Association of Radio Industries and Businesses|RCR]] STD-27 annex 4. The Subscriber Identity Module Expert Group was a committee of specialists assembled by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to draw up the specifications ([[GSM]] 11.11) for interfacing between smart cards and mobile telephones. In 1994, the name SIMEG was changed to SMG9. Japan's current and next generation cellular systems are based on [[W-CDMA (UMTS)]] and [[CDMA2000]] and all use SIM cards. <gallery> Image:Au ic card.jpg|[[KDDI]]'s [[au (mobile phone operator)|au]] IC-Card Image:NTT DoCoMo FOMA card chip green.jpg|[[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[FOMA]] Card </gallery> ==Finland== In July 2005, the
