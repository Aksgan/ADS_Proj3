The components within an assembly are represented as [[Solid modeling|solid]] or [[Freeform surface modelling|surface]] models. <!-- Commented out: [[Image:UGS-NX-5-ActiveMockUp.JPG|thumb|right||[[NX (Unigraphics)|NX 5]] Fully editable digital multi-CAD mock up]] --> The designer generally has access to models that others are working on concurrently. For example, several people may be designing one machine that has many parts. New parts are added to an assembly model as they are created. Each designer has access to the assembly model, while a work in progress, and while working in their own parts. The design evolution is visible to everyone involved. The individual data files describing the 3D geometry of individual components are assembled together through a number of sub-assembly levels to create an assembly describing the whole product. All [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] and [[Collaborative Product Development|CPD]] systems support this form of [[product life cycle management#Bottom-up design|bottom-up]] construction. Some systems, via associative copying of geometry between components also allow [[product life cycle management#Top-Down design|top-down]] method of design. Components can be positioned within the product assembly using absolute coordinate placement methods or by means of mating conditions. Mating conditions are definitions of the relative position of components between each other; for example alignment of axis of two holes or distance of two faces from one another. The final position of al components based on these relationships is calculated using a [[geometry constraint engine]] built into the CAD or visualization package. The importance of Assembly Modeling in achieving the full benefits of PLM has led to ongoing advances in this technology. These include the use of lightweight data structures such as [[JT (visualization format)|JT]] that allow visualization of and interaction with large amounts of product data, direct interface to between Digital Mock ups and PDM systems and [[NX 5#Active digital mock up|active digital mock up]] technology that unites the ability to visualize the assembly mock up with the ability to measure, analyze, simulate, design and redesign. {{DEFAULTSORT:Assembly Modelling}} [[Category:Computer-aided design]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2537</id> <title>Assessment Open Service Interface Definition</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} <!-- Commented out: [[Image:Oki-logo.png|right]] --> The '''Assessment''' [[Open Service Interface Definition]] ('''OSID''') is an [[O.K.I.]] [[specification]] which supports creating, organizing, administrating, evaluating, storing and retrieving [[assessment]]{{dn}} information. '''OSIDs''' are programmatic interfaces which comprise a [[Service Oriented Architecture]] for designing and building [[software reusability|reusable]] and [[interoperable]] [[software]]. Assessments are organized into ''Sections'' and each Section contains one or more ''Items''. Each Assessment, Section, or Item taken by an [[Agent Open Service Interface Definition|Agent]] can also include an ''Evaluation''. There may be relationships between this '''OSID''' and other '''OSIDs'''. For example, an implementation might manage an Assessment's content and questions using the [[Repository Open Service Interface Definition|Repository OSID]]. An Assessment may include optional references to the [[CourseManagement Open Service Interface Definition|Course Management]] and [[Grading Open Service Interface Definition|Grading]] OSIDs. ==See also== *[[Open Service Interface Definitions]] *[[Open Knowledge Initiative]] [[Category:Software architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2544</id> <title>Association Electronique Libre</title> <text>{{Infobox Organization |name = Association Electronique Libre (AEL) ASBL-VZW |image = |image_border = |size = |caption = |map = |msize = |mcaption = |abbreviation = AEL |motto = |formation = 2001, [[Belgium]] |extinction = |type = [[Non-profit organization]] |status = ASBL |purpose = Law, Freedom, Privacy |headquarters = [[Belgium]] |location = |region_served = |membership = |language = |leader_title = |leader_name = |main_organ = |parent_organization = |affiliations = |num_staff = |num_volunteers = |budget = |website = [http://www.ael.be/ www.ael.be] |remarks = }} The '''Association Electronique Libre''' ('''AEL''', sometimes written Association électronique libre) is a Belgian [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[digital rights]] advocacy and legal organization based in Belgium.
