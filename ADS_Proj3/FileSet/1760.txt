The complexity of the algorithm differs per engine.</ref> In Go, there is often no easy way to evaluate a position.<ref name="research.microsoft.com"/><ref>{{Citation| url=http://www.cs.brown.edu/~ynm/Papers/AAAI06-312.pdf|format=PDF| title=Exploring GnuGo's Evaluation Function with SVM | last=Fellows | first=Christopher | work=[[Cornell University]]| date=2006-00-00 | accessdate = 2008-12-19}}</ref> The number of stones on the board (material advantage) is only a weak indicator of the strength of a position, and a territorial advantage (more empty points surrounded) for one player might be compensated by the opponent's strong positions and influence all over the board. As an illustration, the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent is 9 stones. It was not until August 2008 that a computer was able to win a game against a professional level player at this handicap. It was the Mogo program which scored said first victory in an exhibition game played during the US Go Congress.<ref>{{Cite web | title= Supercomputer with innovative software beats Go Professional | url=http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/g.chaslot/muyungwan-mogo/ | accessdate = 2008-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title= AGA News: Kim Prevails Again In Man Vs Machine Rematch | url=http://www.usgo.org/news/ | accessdate = 2009-08-08}}</ref> ===Software assistance=== {{main|Go software}} Beyond programs that play Go, there is an abundance of software available to support players of the game. This includes programs that can be used to view or edit game records and diagrams, programs that allow the user to search for patterns in the games of strong players, and programs that allow users to play against each other over the Internet. There are several file formats used to store game records, the most popular of which is SGF, short for [[Smart Game Format]]. Programs used for editing game records allow the user to record not only the moves, but also variations, commentary and further information on the game.<ref group="nb">Lists of such programs may be found at [http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoEditingPrograms Sensei's Library] or [http://gobase.org/software/editors/ GoBase].</ref> Electronic databases can be used to study life and death situations, [[joseki]], ''[[fuseki]]'' and games by a particular player. Programs are available that give players pattern searching options, which allow players to research positions by searching for high-level games in which similar situations occur. Such software generally lists common follow-up moves that have been played by professionals and gives statistics on win/loss ratio in opening situations. Internet-based [[Internet Go server|Go servers]] allow access to competition with players all over the world.<ref group="nb">Lists of Go servers are kept at [http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoServers Sensei's Library] and [http://www.usgo.org/resources/servers.html the AGA website]</ref> Such servers also allow easy access to professional teaching, with both teaching games and interactive game review being possible.<ref group="nb">The British Go Association provides a [http://www.britgo.org/teaching/teaching.html list of teaching services]</ref> ==In culture and science== ===Literature, television, and film=== Apart from technical literature and study material, Go and its strategies have been the subject of several works of fiction, such as ''[[The Master of Go]]'' by [[Nobel prize]]-winning author [[Yasunari Kawabata]]<ref group="nb">A list of books can be found at [http://senseis.xmp.net/?Literature Sensei's Library]</ref> and ''[[The Girl Who Played Go]]'' by Shan Sa. Other books have used Go as a [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or minor plot device. For example, the 1979 novel ''[[Shibumi (novel)|Shibumi]]'' by [[Trevanian]] centers around the game and uses Go metaphors.<ref name=GoLit>{{Citation | title = Go in Western Literature | chapter = Shibumi | last = McDonald | first = Brian | origyear = 1995 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/go_in_literature.pdf |format=PDF| publisher = American Go Association | pages = 5–6 | editor = Shotwell, Peter | accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref> Go, referred to as Weiqi, features prominently in the 1986 [[Eric Van Lustbader]] novel Jian. Similarly, Go has been used as a subject or plot device in film, such as ''[[Pi (film)|π]]'', ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' and ''[[Tron Legacy]]''.

Of particular note is the [[manga]] (Japanese comic book) and [[anime]] series ''[[Hikaru no Go]]'', released in Japan in 1998, which had a large impact in popularizing Go among young players, both in Japan and—as translations were released—abroad.<ref>{{Citation | first=Yoko | last=Shimatsuka | title=Do Not Pass Go | url = http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,132162,00.html | publisher =Asiaweek | accessdate = 2007-03-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610073841/http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,132162,00.html |archivedate = 2007-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Scanlon | coauthors= | title=Young Japanese go for Go | date=Thursday, 1 August 2002, 03:35 GMT 04:35 UK | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2164532.stm | work =World News | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-21 | language = }}</ref> <!-- Please do not add material to this section unless you feel it is at least as significant as Hikaru no Go.
