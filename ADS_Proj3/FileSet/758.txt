In some cases references or parodies of older movies in contemporary films and TV shows are almost comparable to [[plagiarism]], since they just mimic or imitate a famous scene frame-by-frame instead of adding a funny new element. == See also == * [[Meme]] * [[Collective intelligence]], [[Distributed cognition]] * [[Collective consciousness]] ==Sources== ===General Studies=== *[[Jan Assmann]]: ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford UP 2005 *[[Maurice Halbwachs]]: ''On Collective Memory'', Univ of Chicago Press, 1992, ISBN 0226115968 *[[James W.

It focuses on nightlife events and social opportunities on and near college campuses. Students utilize the service to explore their communities and socially interact. The unique platform also allows the advertising sector to tap into active, outgoing, and socially motivated young people. Starting a profile requires an e-mail address with an ".edu" ending. The site is the brainchild of Emory University alumnus, Zach Suchin, and Emory University student, Jason Schutzbank. The company launched a beta version in September 2006 and launched the official site to the public in September 2007, beginning with a nine-month nightlife tour at 192 campuses across the country.<ref name=busweek>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2007/id2007088_875208_page_2.htm | title= ‘‘Facebook Faces Up’’ at Business Week | accessdate=August 8, 2007 }}</ref> On August 13, 2007, Simex Technologies, Inc.
