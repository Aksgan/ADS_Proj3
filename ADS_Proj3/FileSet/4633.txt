Its athletic teams date to this time and so are known as the ''[[California Golden Bears]]'', ''Cal Bears'', or ''Cal''. Today ''University of California'' refers to a statewide school system and the official name is ''University of California, Berkeley'', frequently shortened to ''UC Berkeley'', ''Berkeley'', ''Cal.'' Usage of ''UCB'' and ''University of California '''at''' Berkeley'' is discouraged<ref>{{cite journal | title = Editorial Style Guide | year = 2009 | pages = 20 | publisher = University of California, Berkeley | url = http://identity.berkeley.edu/guidelines/berkeley-editorial-style-09.pdf }}</ref> and the domain name is <tt>berkeley.edu</tt>. The term "Cal Berkeley" is not a correct reference to the school, but occasionally used. Berkeley is unrelated to the [[Berklee College of Music]] or [[Berkeley College]]. ==Campus== {{Main|Campus of the University of California, Berkeley}} The Berkeley campus encompasses approximately {{convert|1232|acre|ha}}, though the "central campus" occupies only the low-lying western {{convert|178|acre|ha}} of this area. Of the remaining {{convert|1000|acre|ha}}, approximately {{convert|200|acre|ha}} are occupied by the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]; other facilities above the main campus include the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]] and several research units, notably the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]], the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]], an undeveloped {{convert|800|acre|ha|1}} ecological preserve, the [[University of California Botanical Garden]] and a recreation center in Strawberry Canyon. To the west of the central campus is the [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown business district of Berkeley]]; to the northwest is the neighborhood of North Berkeley, including the so-called [[Gourmet ghetto|Gourmet Ghetto]], a commercial district known for high quality dining due to the presence of such world-renowned restaurants as [[Chez Panisse]]. Immediately to the north is a quiet residential neighborhood known as [[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]] with a large graduate student population{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}; situated north of that are the upscale residential neighborhoods of the [[Berkeley Hills]], where many faculty members live{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Immediately southeast of campus lies fraternity row, and beyond that the [[Clark Kerr Campus]] and an upscale residential area named [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont]]. The [[Southside, Berkeley, California|area south of the university]] includes student housing and [[Telegraph Avenue]], one of Berkeley's main shopping districts with stores, street vendors and restaurants catering to college students and tourists. In addition, the University also owns land to the northwest of the main campus, a {{convert|90|acre|ha|sing=on}} married student housing complex in the nearby town of Albany ("Albany Village" and the "Gill Tract"), and a field research station several miles to the north in [[Richmond, California]]. Outside of the Bay Area, the University owns various research laboratories and research forests in both northern and southern Sierra Nevada. ===Architecture=== [[Image:South Hall--UC Berkeley--Panoramic.jpg|thumb|left|[[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]] (1873), one of the two original buildings of the University of California, still stands on the Berkeley campus]] What is considered the historic campus today was the result of the 1898 "International Competition for the [[Phoebe Hearst]] Architectural Plan for the University of California," funded by [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s mother and initially held in the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]; eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco in 1899.<ref>[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/online_exhibits/romapacifica/index.html Online Exhibit on the Hearst Architectural Competition]</ref> The winner was Frenchman [[Émile Bénard]], however he refused to personally supervise the implementation of his plan and the task was subsequently given to architecture professor [[John Galen Howard]].
