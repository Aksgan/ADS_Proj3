This patchkit [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from 386BSD and grew into an operating system taken from U.C. Berkeley's 4.3BSD-Lite (Net/2) tape with many 386BSD components and code from the [[Free Software Foundation]]. After two public beta releases via FTP (1.0-GAMMA on September 2, 1993, and 1.0-EPSILON on October 3, 1993), the first official release was FreeBSD 1.0, available via FTP on November 1, 1993 and on CDROM on December 30, 1993. This official release was coordinated by [[Jordan Hubbard]], Nate Williams and Rodney W. Grimes with a name thought up by David Greenman. [[Walnut Creek CDROM]] agreed to distribute FreeBSD on CD and gave the project a machine to work on along with a fast Internet connection, which Hubbard later said helped stir FreeBSD's rapid growth. A "highly successful" FreeBSD 1.1 release followed in May 1994.<ref name=history> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/history.html | title = A Brief History of FreeBSD | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-01-31 }} </ref> However, there were legal concerns about the BSD Net/2 release source code used in 386BSD. After a [[USL v. BSDi|lawsuit]] between UNIX copyright owner at the time [[Unix System Laboratories]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the FreeBSD project re-engineered most of the system using the 4.4BSD-Lite release from Berkeley, which, owing to this lawsuit, had none of the [[AT&T]] source code earlier BSD versions had depended upon, making it an unbootable operating system. Following much work, the outcome was released as FreeBSD 2.0 in January 1995.<ref name=history /> FreeBSD 2.0 featured a revamp of the original [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] virtual memory system, which was optimized for performance under high loads. This release also introduced the [[FreeBSD Ports]] system, which made downloading, building and installing third party software very easy. By 1996 FreeBSD had become popular among commercial and ISP users, powering extremely successful sites like [[Simtel|Walnut Creek CD-ROM]] (a huge repository of software that broke several throughput records on the Internet), [[Yahoo!]] and [[Hotmail]]. The last release along the 2-STABLE branch was 2.2.8 in November 1998.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hubbard|first=Jordan|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/history.html|title=A Brief History of FreeBSD|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> FreeBSD 3.0 brought many more changes, including the switch to the [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF binary]] format. Support for [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] systems and the 64-bit Alpha platform were also added. The 3-STABLE branch ended with 3.5.1 in June 2000.<ref name=history /> ==Features== ===Networking=== FreeBSD's TCP/IP stack is based on the [[BSD|4.2BSD]] implementation of TCP/IP which greatly contributed to the widespread adoption of these protocols.<ref> {{cite book |last = McKusick |first = Marshall |middle = Kirk |title = The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System |chapter = Section 2.13 |year = 2005}} </ref> FreeBSD also supports [[IPv6]], [[SCTP]], [[IPSec]], [[IPX]], [[Apple talk|AppleTalk]] and wireless networking. ===Storage=== FreeBSD has several unique features related to storage. [[Soft updates]] maintain filesystem integrity in the event of a system crash. The [[GEOM]] framework provides features such as [[RAID]] (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), [[full disk encryption]], and concatenation of drives. Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. FreeBSD also provides the [[ZFS]] filesystem as an alternative to the normal [[UFS2]] file system. ===Security=== FreeBSD provides several security-related features including [[access control list]]s (ACLs), security event auditing, extended file system attributes, fine-grained [[Capability (computers)|capabilities]] and [[mandatory access control]]s (MAC). These security enhancements were developed by the '''TrustedBSD''' project. The project was founded by [[Robert Watson (computer scientist)|Robert Watson]] with the goal of implementing concepts from the [[Common Criteria]] for Information Technology Security Evaluation and the [[TCSEC|Orange Book]]. This project is ongoing and many of its extensions have been integrated into FreeBSD. The project has also ported the [[NSA]]'s [[FLASK]]/TE implementation from [[SELinux]] to FreeBSD. Other work includes the development of [[OpenBSM]], an open source implementation of Sun's Basic Security Module (BSM) API and audit log file format, which supports an extensive security audit system. This was shipped as part of FreeBSD 6.2. Other infrastructure work in FreeBSD performed as part of the TrustedBSD Project has included [[SYN cookies]], GEOM and OpenPAM. While most components of the TrustedBSD project are eventually folded into the main sources for FreeBSD, many features, once fully matured, find their way into other operating systems. For example, [[OpenPAM]] and [[UFS2]] have been adopted by [[NetBSD]]. Moreover, the TrustedBSD MAC Framework has been adopted by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for [[Mac OS X]]. Much of this work was sponsored by [[DARPA]]. ===Portability=== FreeBSD has been ported to a variety of processor architectures. The FreeBSD project organizes architectures into tiers that characterize the level of support provided. Tier 1 architectures are mature and fully supported. Tier 2 architectures are undergoing major development. Tier 3 architectures are experimental or are no longer under active development (as is the case of DEC Alpha) and tier 4 architectures have no support at all. FreeBSD has been ported to the following architectures:<ref name=portability> {{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/platforms |title=FreeBSD/Supported Platforms |publisher=freebsd.org |accessdate=2009-09-06}} </ref> {| class="wikitable" |- !
