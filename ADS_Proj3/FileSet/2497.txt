Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, "value" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Basically, lean is centered on ''preserving value with less work''. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as "Lean" only in the 1990s.<ref name="womack">{{cite book |last=Womack |first=James P. |coauthors=Daniel T.

Lean manufacturing is a variation on the theme of [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] based on optimizing flow; it is a present-day instance of the recurring theme in human history toward increasing efficiency, decreasing waste, and using empirical methods to decide what matters, rather than uncritically accepting pre-existing ideas. As such, it is a chapter in the larger narrative that also includes such ideas as the [[wikt:thrift#Noun|folk wisdom of thrift]], [[time and motion study]], [[Taylorism]], the [[Efficiency Movement]], and [[Fordism]]. Lean manufacturing is often seen as a more refined version of earlier efficiency efforts, building upon the work of earlier leaders such as [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylor]] or [[Henry Ford|Ford]], and learning from their mistakes. ==Overview== Lean principles come from the Japanese manufacturing industry. The term was first coined by John Krafcik in a Fall 1988 article, "Triumph of the Lean Production System," published in the [[Sloan Management Review]] and based on his master's thesis at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krafcik |first=John F. |title=Triumph of the lean production system |journal=Sloan Management Review |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=41–52 |year=1988}}</ref> Krafcik had been a quality engineer in the Toyota-GM NUMMI joint venture in California before coming to MIT for MBA studies. Krafcik's research was continued by the [[International Motor Vehicle Program]] (IMVP) at MIT, which produced the international best-seller book co-authored by Jim Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos called ''The Machine That Changed the World.''<ref name="womack" /> A complete historical account of the IMVP and how the term "lean" was coined is given by Holweg (2007).<ref name="Holweg 2007 420–437"/> For many, Lean is the set of "tools" that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste ([[muda (Japanese term)|''muda'']]). As waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced. Examples of such "tools" are [[Value Stream Mapping]], [[5S (methodology)|Five S]], [[Kanban]] (pull systems), and [[poka-yoke]] (error-proofing). There is a second approach to Lean Manufacturing, which is promoted by Toyota, in which the focus is upon improving the "flow" or smoothness of work, thereby steadily eliminating [[mura (Japanese term)|''mura'']] ("unevenness") through the system and not upon 'waste reduction' per se. Techniques to improve flow include [[production leveling]], "pull" production (by means of ''[[kanban]]'') and the ''[[Heijunka box]]''. This is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies, which may partially account for its lack of popularity. The difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself, but rather the prime approach to achieving it. The implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed, and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence. The advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a system-wide perspective, whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective. Both Lean and TPS can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste.<ref>{{cite book |title=Toyota Production System |last=Ohno |first=Taiichi |year=1988 |publisher=Productivity Press |page=8 |isbn=0-915299-14-3}}</ref> These principles include: Pull processing, Perfect first-time quality, Waste minimization, Continuous improvement, Flexibility, Building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers, [[Autonomation]], Load leveling and Production flow and Visual control. The disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the TPS has grown pragmatically since 1948 as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities. Thus what one sees today is the result of a 'need' driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework. Toyota's view is that the main method of Lean is not the tools, but the reduction of three types of waste: [[muda (Japanese term)|''muda'']] ("non-value-adding work"), [[muri (Japanese term)|''muri'']] ("overburden"), and [[mura (Japanese term)|''mura'']] ("unevenness"), to
