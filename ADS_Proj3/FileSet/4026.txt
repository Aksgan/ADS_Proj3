a brightness or color signal, a function of a two-dimensional location. A 2D image can have a continuous spatial domain, as in a traditional photograph or painting; or the image can be discretized in space, as in a [[raster scanning|raster scanned]] [[digital image]]. Color images are typically represented as a combination of images in three [[primary colors]], so that the signal is vector-valued with dimension three. * ''[[Video]]s''. A video signal is a sequence of images. A point in a video is identified by its two-dimensional position and by the time at which it occurs, so a video signal has a three-dimensional domain. Analog video has one continuous domain dimension (across a [[scan line]]) and two discrete dimensions (frame and line). * Biological ''[[membrane potential]]s''. The value of the [[signal (biology)|signal]] is a straightforward [[electric potential]] ("voltage"). The domain is more difficult to establish. Some [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[organelle]]s have the same membrane potential throughout; [[neuron]]s generally have different potentials at different points. These signals have very low energies, but are enough to make nervous systems work; they can be measured in aggregate by the techniques of [[electrophysiology]]. == Frequency analysis == {{main|Frequency domain}} Signals are often analyzed or modeled in terms of their [[frequency spectrum]]. [[Frequency domain]] techniques are applicable to all signals, both continuous-time and discrete-time. If a signal is passed through an [[LTI system]], the frequency spectrum of the resulting output signal is the product of the frequency spectrum of the original input signal and the [[frequency response]] of the system. == Entropy == Another important property of a signal (actually, of a statistically defined class of signals) is its [[information entropy|entropy]] or ''information content''. ==See also== {{wikibooks|Signals and Systems}} *[[Impulse function]] *[[Signal noise]] *[[Signal to noise ratio]] *[[Signal processing]] **[[Digital signal processing]] *[[Image processing]] **[[Digital image processing]] * Wikibook [[wikibooks:Signals and Systems|Signals and Systems]] == References == * Hsu, P.

This article deals with current signals intelligence collection equipment by nation, including fixed and mobile ground stations, ships, submarines, aircraft and satellites. See [[Signals intelligence by alliances, nations and industries]] for the organization of SIGINT activities, and for context, see [[Signals intelligence in modern history]]. For a complete hierarchical list of articles, see the intelligence cycle management [[Intelligence cycle management#See also|hierarchy]].'' '''Signals intelligence Operational Platforms''' are employed by nations to collect signals intelligence, which is [[list of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence-gathering]] by interception of signals, whether between people (i.e., COMINT or communications intelligence) or between machines (i.e., ELINT or electronic intelligence), or mixtures of the two. As sensitive information is often encrypted, signals intelligence often involves the use of [[cryptanalysis]]. However, traffic analysis&mdash;the study of who is signalling whom and in what quantity&mdash;can often produce valuable information, even when the messages themselves cannot be decrypted. ==Ground Platforms== It can be difficult to draw the line between a ground-based SIGINT receiving station, and facilities that have control, coordination, and processing functions in the "bigger picture" of signals intelligence. Many stations, for the countries with stations in many parts of the world, do have both aspects. There are also some that are clearly intercept only. The first signals intelligence platforms were listening stations on the ground. Early tactical stations were in use as early as World War I, but permanent strategic signals intelligence stations were established as world tensions grew before WWII. Arguably, one combined intercept and jamming technique of WWI was the use of shotguns against carrier pigeons, followed by reading the message attached to the bird. While pigeons can probably be safe, other collection techniques may enjoy a resurgence. One specialized technique, originally used in the First World War but again in the Korean War, was interception using ground return from wired telephones. In mountainous terrain, it might again have applications, such as Afghan caves where wire might be run without the danger of free-space interception. Satellite communications generally must be intercepted by large parabolic antennas on the ground, although there are possibilities that aircraft, intelligence satellites, and ships might also intercept. "To receive satellite signals, ...only parabolic antennas are used. If the parabolic antennas are standing on an open site, it is possible to calculate on the basis of their position, their elevation and their compass (azimuth) angle which satellite is being received. This is possible, for example, in Morwenstow (UK), Yakima (USA) or Sugar Grove (USA)." <ref name = EPE>{{citation|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=European Parliament Report on ECHELON|year=2001|month=July|accessdate=2006-08-14}}</ref>. ===Australia: Ground Platforms=== A facility at [[Geraldton, Western Australia]], with Australian and British personnel was built in the 1990s.<ref name = EPE /> The British personnel were previously assigned to Hong Kong. It is reported to have four satellite antennas...trained on satellites above the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. "According to statements made under oath in the Australian Parliament by an expert, transmissions from civilian telecommunications satellites are intercepted at Geraldton." Another station, at [[Pine Gap]], was established in 1966 and
