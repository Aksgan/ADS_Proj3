the message. After three months there was no success, but Mavis Laver, a 19-year-old student, found that rodding produced ''PERS'' for the first four letters of one message. She then (against orders) tried beyond this and obtained ''PERSONALE'' (Italian for "personal"). This confirmed that the Italians were indeed using the same machines and procedures. The subsequent breaking of Italian naval Enigma ciphers led to substantial Allied successes. The cipher-breaking was disguised by sending a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] to the known location of a warship before attacking it, so that the Italians assumed that this was how they had been discovered. The [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] victory at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan|Battle of Matapan]] (March 1941) was considerably helped by [[Ultra]] intelligence obtained from Italian naval Enigma signals. ===Polish disclosures=== On 15 March 1939, Germany invaded [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], and Britain and France pledged support for Poland in the event of action that threatened her independence.<ref> {{ Citation | last = Chamberlain | first = Neville | author-link = Neville Chamberlain | date = 31 March 1939 | title = European Situation (2.52 p.m.) | periodical = Hansard | publisher = UK Parliament | volume = 345 | url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/mar/31/european-situation-1 | accessdate = 3 January 2009 }} </ref> Then, on 27 April, Germany withdrew from the [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] of January 1934. The Polish General Staff, realizing what was likely to happen, decided to share their work on Enigma decryption with their western allies. [[Marian Rejewski]] later wrote: {{blockquote|[I]t was not [as [[Harry Hinsley]] suggested, cryptological] difficulties of ours that prompted us to work with the British and French, but only the deteriorating political situation.

They eventually made their way to [[France]].
