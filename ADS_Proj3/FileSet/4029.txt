is similar to (V)2 but adds an additional shelter and workstation. :*(V)4 for [[Echelons above Corps]] Both TROJAN SPIRIT II and TROJAN SPIRIT LITE will transition to the Warfighter Information Network-Terrestrial (WIN-T). =====US Army: Tactical Ground Stations===== While some may call "[[Transformation of the United States Army]]" a "buzzword", the idea reflects some very major changes. Among the most basic is moving away from the [[Division (military)|Division]] as the fundamental unit of action, and moving to smaller and more flexible [[Brigade combat team]]s (BCT). As a very basic part of those changes, not only are considerably more intelligence assets being assigned to the BCTs, but to larger army formations. In both these cases, SIGINT represents a very major portion of the growth in assets<ref name=AUSAmi2007>{{Citation | last = Association of the US Army | title = Key Issues Relevant to Army Intelligence Transformation |date=July 2007 | url = http://www.ausa.org/webpub/DeptILW.nsf/byid/JRAY-75LT2E | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | format = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009114714/http://www.ausa.org/webpub/DeptILW.nsf/byid/JRAY-75LT2E |archivedate = 2007-10-09}}</ref>. Each combat BCT has an organic military intelligence (MI) company, with improved SIGINT capability. In addition, five battlefield surveillance brigades (BfSB), of which an MI Collection Battalion is the core element, are being formed. Each of those battalions is 1/3 SIGINT; the Army expects to have more than 7,000 new MI soldiers by 2013. Prophet Block I began rolling out in 1999-2000, and was operational in Afghanistan. It replaced the AN/TSQ-138 Trailblazer, AN/TRQ-32 Teammate, AN/TLQ-17A Trafficjam, and the AN/PRD-12 systems.<ref name=DeagelProphet>{{citation | title = AN/MLQ-40(V)3 Prophet | url = http://www.deagel.com/Special-Purpose-Vehicles/ANMLQ-40V3-Prophet_a000507001.aspx | accessdate = 2007-11-13 }}</ref>. The system will be getting incremental improvements, which reflect both improvements in technology and in military organizational structure <ref name=MI-Prophet>{{citation | title = Prophet: Tactical SIGINT for the 21st Century - ground signal intelligence system | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBS/is_3_26/ai_67544226 | journal = Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin | date = July, 2000 | author = Kevin C.

At the time of initial operational capability, the assumption was that PROPHET would be issued six systems per division, four per armored cavalry regiment (ACR), three per Initial Brigade Combat Team (IBCT). Tasking for Prophet will come from primarily from the division-level Analysis and Control Element, modified by brigade-specific priorities and then send them to the Prophet via SINCGARS radio. Physically, the basic Prophet platform is built around a mounted AN/PRD-13(V)2 direction-finding (DF) system designed to provide force protection in a DS role to the maneuver brigade. This system operates in the [[High frequency|HF]], [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] spectra. It provides line-of-bearing (LOB) data and intercept on unencrypted, single-channel push-to-talk transmissions. It can be put into subassemblies that can be carried by a four-man team individual soldiers, althouth the more common deployment will be in an M1097 [[HMMWV]]. In the vehicle-mounted variant, it can operate while moving; the vehicle also has racks for two AN/VRC-92 [[SINCGARS]] Combat Net Radios with backpacks, and carries an antenna mast and other equipment. Tactical communications, not just for SIGINT, are "flattening", such that units do not just report up their chain of command, but to adjacent units. One of the rationales for doing so is that a combat unit can see an opportunity and move against it, without it being misidentified by a neighboring unit and being engaged with "friendly fire." Prophet Block II adds electronic attack (EA) capability to Prophet, while Block III upgrades the Prophet receiver to collect against advanced and special signals. These enhancements will be coordinated with [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] and tactical aircraft with expanded SIGINT capability. Blocks IV (expected [[IOC]] 2008) and V (expected [[IOC]] 2015) <ref name=Lawlor2002>{{citation | url = http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=324&zoneid=31 | title = Signal Intelligence System Uncovers Enemy Sites | author = Lawlor, Maryann | date = October 2002 | journal = Signal | accessdate = 2007-11-13 }}</ref> add [[MASINT]] along with micro-and robotic receivers to the Prophet Ground system. MASINT will include ground surveillance radars (PPSSD) and the Improvedâ€”Remotely Monitored Battlefield Sensor System (I-REMBASS) aboard a shelter-mounted HMMWV. Prophet, with the I-REMBASS monitoring system, will form the Ground Sensor Platoon of the [[brigade combat team]] Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Squadron. Prophet Air will begin in a UAV. For SIGINT operations, the basic US Marine augmentation to Force Recon is a 6-man detachment from a [[Radio Reconnaissance Platoon]]. There is a SIGINT platoon within the Intelligence Company of the new Marine Special Operations Support Group <ref name=MARSOC>{{citation | url =http://www.usmc.mil/sgtmaj/smmcsymposium.nsf/440ade826dba63718525685f0055d7d5/41a370d83d1384dd852573360065ecc3/$FILE/MARSOC%20Brief.pdf |format=PDF| title = U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command(MARSOC) | accessdate = 2007-11-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071216050416/http://www.usmc.mil/sgtmaj/smmcsymposium.nsf/440ade826dba63718525685f0055d7d5/41a370d83d1384dd852573360065ecc3/$FILE/MARSOC+Brief.pdf |archivedate = 2007-12-16}}</ref>.
