Now seventeen, Corinne asks her mother to let her go to Paris to become one. Though worried about the dangers, her mother supports her and gives Corinne her blessing, as well as a letter to Monsieur Treville, the captain of the Musketeers and an old friend of her father's. The next day before leaving, Corinne's mother reminds her about what her father use to say: "True courage is pursuing your dream, even when everyone else says it's impossible." Hugging her mother goodbye, Corinne sets off for [[Paris]] with her [[kitten]], Miette, and Alexander, D'Artagnan's old horse. Arriving in Paris, Corinne watches four Musketeers displaying their skills. She tells them about becoming a Musketeer herself and asks them where to find Treville. They tease her while a mean dog, Brutus, knocks her over and steals her letter. Attempting to get it back, Corinne and Miette chase him into the Musketeer headquarters, where Treville is talking to Philippe, the kingdom's regent,Prince Louis's cousin and Brutus' owner. When hearing why she is there, Philippe scoffs at Corinne's dream to be a Musketeer, saying girls don't possess the proper skills. However, Treville kindly invites her inside. Feeling triumphant at first, she is disappointed when Treville says she's not ready for active duty, but he tells her to keep practicing and that if she needs anything, to come to him. After leaving, Corinne sits outside with Miette when Brutus sneaks up on them again and chases after Miette. While in pursuit, Corinne literally bumps into three other girls: Aramina a fashionista, Viveca a dancer and Renée a violinist. She chases Miette and Brutus to the royal kitchen, where the cruel overseer, Madame de Bossé, mistakes her as a new maid. Before being dragged off by her, Corinne helps an elderly servant named Héléne, who is touched by her kindness. Corinne is then introduced to three other maids, who turn out to be Viveca, Aramina and Renée. Due to Corinne's earlier rampage, all three arrive extremely messy and disheveled, getting them in trouble with de Bossé, who punishes them with extra work. Due to this, the girls have a sharp dislike for Corinne and give her the extra work while ignoring her in the process. However, by the end of the day and through her various good deeds, the three see Corinne has a kind heart and the four become friends. One day, while the four clean the great hall, Corinne meets Prince Louis, who is going to be crowned king shortly. Louis loves science and is currently developing a hot air balloon. As he begins to leave, a chandelier crashes down from the ceiling, barely missing the prince. As the debris flies towards them, each girl defends herself: Viveca whips out her cleaning towel, breaking a flying candle in half; Aramina swiftly kicks a piece of the candelabra in two; Renee throws her feather duster, knocking glass shards away from her and Corinne uses her broom in a sword-like manner to bash away hanging crystals. Philippe and the Musketeers rush to Louis while Héléne, who was watching from the balcony, looks at the four girls in amazement. Philippe escorts a shaken Louis out of the hall, demanding that the cause of the accident be found at once. While removing the mess, Corinne notices the chandelier rope appears to have been cut. She also finds a small ruby on the floor near the rope handle. As they clean, the three other girls ask Corinne where she learned to move the way she did. She then tells them about her dream of becoming a Musketeer. Shocked, all three also shared their own ambition to become Musketeers themselves. Upon hearing this, Héléne has them follow her through a series of secret passages before arriving in a hidden chamber beneath the palace. She explains that the Musketeers used to train here before Treville moved them to the larger headquarters. She displays her own fighting abilities as she tests each girl, judging their level of skill. Afterwards, Héléne tells the girls that they are skilled, but they each have a long way to go. After they plead for her to teach them, Héléne starts training them. Each girl chooses a weapon of their choice and develops her own unique fighting style. That night, a furious Philippe confronts the captain of his guards. It is revealed that Philippe plans to have Louis assassinated so he can take over the kingdom and that the guard had cut the chandelier rope - his dagger is missing a ruby. Philippe orders the captain to sabotage Louis' hot air balloon, which the prince is planning to test the next day. Louis prepares to launch the balloon when the safety ropes, cut by the guard, break and the balloon blows away. The force of the jolt knocks the prince out of the basket and his foot gets stuck in the ladder. Corinne, who is washing the windows, sees Louis dangling upside down from the balloon
