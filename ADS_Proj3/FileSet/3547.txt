In particular, the development of labeled 2-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (2FDG) by the Brookhaven group under the direction of Al Wolf and Joanna Fowler was a major factor in expanding the scope of PET imaging.<ref>IDO, T., C-N.

Brain images obtained with an ordinary (non-PET) nuclear scanner demonstrated the concentration of FDG in that organ. Later, the substance was used in dedicated positron tomographic scanners, to yield the modern procedure. The logical extension of positron instrumentation was a design using two 2-dimensional arrays. PC-I was the first instrument using this concept and was designed in 1968, completed in 1969 and reported in 1972. The first applications of PC-I in tomographic mode as distinguished from the computed tomographic mode were reported in 1970.<ref>BROWNELL G.L., Dave Marcum, B. HOOP JR., and D.E.

The PET/CT scanner, attributed to Dr David Townsend and Dr Nutt was named by TIME Magazine as the medical invention of the year in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} == Description == [[Image:PET-detectorsystem 2.png|thumb|Schematic view of a detector block and ring of a PET scanner]] === Operation === To conduct the scan, a short-lived [[radioactivity|radioactive]] tracer [[isotope]] is injected into the living subject (usually into [[blood]] circulation). The tracer is chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule. There is a waiting period while the active molecule becomes concentrated in tissues of interest; then the subject is placed in the imaging scanner. The molecule most commonly used for this purpose is [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), a sugar, for which the waiting period is typically an hour. During the scan a record of tissue concentration is made as the tracer decays. [[Image:PET-schema.png|thumb|200px|right|Schema of a PET acquisition process]] As the radioisotope undergoes [[positron emission]] decay (also known as positive [[beta decay]]), it emits a positron, an antiparticle of the [[electron]] with opposite charge. The emitted positron travels in tissue for a short distance (typically less than 1 mm, but dependent on the isotope<ref>{{cite book | title=PET: physics, instrumentation, and scanners|author=Michael E. Phelps|publisher=Springer|year=2006|pages=8â€“10 | isbn=0387349464}}</ref>), during which time it loses kinetic energy, until it decelerates to a point where it can interact with an electron.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_i/p/pet_imaging.aspx|title=PET Imaging |publisher=GE Healthcare}}</ref> The encounter annihilates both electron and positron, producing a pair of [[electron-positron annihilation|annihilation]] ([[gamma ray|gamma]]) [[photon]]s moving in approximately opposite directions. These are detected when they reach a [[scintillator]] in the scanning device, creating a burst of light which is detected by [[photomultiplier]] tubes or silicon [[avalanche photodiode]]s (Si APD). The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite direction (it would be exactly opposite in their [[center of mass frame]], but the scanner has no way to know this, and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance). Photons that do not arrive in temporal "pairs" (i.e. within a timing-window of a few nanoseconds) are ignored. === Localization of the positron annihilation event === The most significant fraction of electron-positron decays result in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence it is possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called formally the '''line of response''' or '''LOR'''). In practice the LOR has a finite width as the emitted photons are not exactly 180 degrees apart. If the resolving time of the detectors is less than 500 [[picoseconds]] rather than about 10 [[nanoseconds]], it is possible to localize the event to a segment of a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]], whose length is determined by the detector timing resolution. As the timing resolution improves, the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of the image will improve, requiring fewer events to achieve the same image quality. This technology is not yet common, but it is available on some new systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |title=Invitation to Cover: Advancements in "Time-of-Flight" Technology Make New PET/CT Scanner at Penn a First in the World |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref> === Image reconstruction using coincidence statistics === More commonly, a technique much like the reconstruction of [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) data is used, although the [[data set]] collected in PET is much poorer than CT, so reconstruction techniques are more difficult (see [[#Image reconstruction|Image reconstruction]] of PET). Using statistics collected from tens-of-thousands of coincidence events, a set of simultaneous equations for the total activity of each parcel of tissue along many LORs can be solved by a number of techniques, and thus a map of radioactivities as a function of location for parcels or bits of tissue (also called [[voxel]]s), may be constructed and plotted. The resulting
