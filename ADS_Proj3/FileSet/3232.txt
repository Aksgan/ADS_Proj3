with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business. ===ScanSoft history (origins)=== In 1974, [[Raymond Kurzweil]] founded the '''Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.''' to develop the first omni-font optical character recognition system &mdash; a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.<ref name="KURZWEIL COMPUTER PRODUCTS, INC.">[http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/speechsynthesis/ss_kurz.htm "KURZWEIL COMPUTER PRODUCTS, INC."] ''Smithsonian Speech Synthesis History Project (SSSHP) 1986 - 2002''</ref> In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.<ref name="KURZWEIL COMPUTER PRODUCTS, INC."/> The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft. In March 1992, a new company called '''Visioneer, Inc''' was founded to develop scanner hardware & software products, such as [[PaperPort]]. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999. Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the company name. * 1974 &mdash; '''Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc''' founded to develop the first omni-font optical character recognition system * 1980 &mdash; Xerox buys Kurzweil Computer Products and runs it as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft. * Mar. 1992 &mdash; '''Visioneer, Inc''' founded to develop scanner hardware & software products. * Jan. 1999 &mdash; Visioneer sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. * Mar. 1999 &mdash; Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox and adopts ScanSoft as new company-wide name.

Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie, the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance. ===Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft=== Nuance was founded in 1994 as a spinoff of [[SRI International]]'s Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialise the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in [[Menlo Park, California]], Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call-centre automation. Call-Centres had just centralised the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call-centres, was-then and still-is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits. Early Nuance applications ran on WindowsNT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on [[Eicon|Dialogic]] boards for the telephony hardware. * 1994 &mdash; Nuance spun off from SRI's STAR Lab * 1996 &mdash; Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application * 2000 April 13 &mdash; Nuance files initial public offering on the Nasdaq under the symbol NUAN * 2000 November 15 &mdash; Nuance acquires SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5MM in cash and stock. * ''(Description/chronology of Nuance's actual speech product offerings needed!)'' In simple terms; the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as [[ViaVoice]] was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called Speaker-Independent Natural Language [[Speech Recognition]], (SI-NLSR or just NLSR) for call automation. The limited vocabulary was typically in the region of a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity [[Intel]] [[x86]] servers until the early noughties. During the late 90's and into the noughties Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including [[Philips]] SpeechPearl, [[SpeechWorks]] and other smaller players which were typically geographically focussed such as [[Vocalis]] in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs onboard to improve the efficiency and density of the system. Each speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are "modelled", samples of real spoken-language is recorded and analysed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish being a variant of Dutch, or Swiss German being a dialect of High-German. Different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection. Europe's [[Philips]] had by far the largest language coverage which included Flemish and Welsh - although these may have been paid for by an EU grant or subsidy. Later, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties including independent software vendors and [[IVR]] vendors who would build applications on top of an [[IVR]] platform. SpeechWorks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX. Nuance 7 was launched in the late nineties and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows. Nuance 8 added Statistical Language Modelling - an adaption of technologies used in technologies such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognise at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL. Nuance 8.5 was the last point release before the take-over by ScanSoft These systems were significantly different to the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as [[ViaVoice]], which is now also a Nuance product. Nuance marketed their brand and technology at call centre exhibitions although they rarely delivered solutions directly relying on ISV & telecom manufacturing partners instead, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya, Syntellect and others. Nuance provided a core
