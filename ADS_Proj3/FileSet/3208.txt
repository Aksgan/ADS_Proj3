==Notable innovations== Throughout the times, Norsk Data produced a long string of extremely innovative computers. Some examples of this include: * The [[NORD-1]], the first minicomputer to have memory paging as a standard option, and the first machine to have floating-point instructions standard * The [[NORD-5]], the world's first 32-bit minicomputer - beating the [[VAX]], often claimed to be first - by 6 years * The [[NORD-100]], a very early application of bitslicing in minicomputers * The [[KPS]] (Knowledge Process System), developed in joint venture with [[Racal|Racal plc]], a system which pioneered running a multi-user [[LISP machine]] environment ==Post-breakup companies== Although the Norsk Data breakup caused a large number of layoffs, a large number of employees and intellectual property lived on in various smaller companies. Some went bankrupt quite quickly, some were bought for tax purposes. The quality of management also varied widely. * The Hardware Research and Development group was split off into [[Dolphin Server Technology]] in 1989. Dolphin later split off into a number of companies, by far the most successful of these being [[Dolphin Interconnect Solutions]], a cluster interconnect hardware company. ===Norsk Data UK=== In the UK Telenor kept the Norsk Data name for several years, focusing in on Hardware support and maintenance contracts, mainly with [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HMCG]] and local governments. At the tail end of the dot com boom Telenor decided to try and expand the service by acquiring the ISP [[CIX]] and a hosting company in Manchester, XTML. The name and business focus of this group of companies was changed several times in the early 21st Century, being known as Nextra with Barry Hartop as CEO (along with the acquired CIX & XTML), Telenor Business Solutions (still with CIX & XTML) and finally reverting to ND Norsk Data once CIX & XTML had been resold to Pipex, reportedly for less than 10% of the purchase price. Much of the loss in value of the acquired companies was put down to the astronomical "goodwill" payment included in the purchase price during the "dotcom boom" and the poor interim management of the group. ==Hardware== Significant Norsk Data computer models include: *[[NORD-1]], [[16-bit]] [[minicomputer]] launched in 1968, could run TSS (see below) from 1971 *[[NORD-5]], [[32-bit]] [[Superminicomputer|supermini]] launched in 1972 *[[NORD-9]] *[[NORD-10]], 16-bit mini launched in 1973 *NORD-10/S, version of the Nord-10 with cache, paging, and other improvements *[[NORD-50]], second generation 32-bit supermini in 1975 *[[NORD-100]], 16-bit, from 1978, later renamed ND-100. First single-board 16-bit minicomputer CPU. *[[ND-500]], third generation 32-bit supermini in 1981 *[[ND-500#ND-505|ND-505]], [[28-bit]] computer allowed through the [[CoCom]] [[embargo]] of the [[Eastern bloc]] *[[ND-5000]] ("Samson"), fourth generation 32-bit supermini in 1987 (5400, 5700, 5800) *[[ND-5000#Rallar|ND-5850]] ("Rallar"), fifth generation 32-bit supermini in 1987 *ND-5900-2, ND-5900-3, and ND-5904, dual-, triple- and quad-CPU 5000 series machines. ==Software== In addition to hardware, Norsk Data also produced a wide range of system and application software: *[[NORD-TSS]] &ndash; Nord [[Time sharing|Time Sharing System]] from 1971 *[[SINTRAN]] &ndash; [[Operating system]] for Nord 10 and later models, version III from 1973, III/VS in 1974 *[[SIBAS]] [[database management system|database]] in 1975 *[[FORTRAN]] [[compiler]] *[[ND-Paint]] [[Graphic editing]] - [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] based *[[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] compiler developed in [[Kiel]] and [[M端lheim an der Ruhr]], [[Germany]] with the CAT-System (Common Abstract Tree-Language) using the [[Vienna Development Method]], 1983 *[[COBOL]] compiler *[[C (programming language)|C]] compiler developed in Kiel and M端lheim an der Ruhr, Germany with the CAT-System using the Vienna Development Method, 1984 *[[PLANC]] compiler - PLANC was the system language of Norsk Data - a language "defined by its implementation" *[[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] compiler developed by Prof. Dr. Hans Langmaack and his team at [[Kiel]] University in Germany with the CAT-System using the Vienna Development Method, 1982 *[[PED (Editor)|PED]] &ndash; "Programmer's EDitor" Screen oriented [[text editor]] *[[LED (Editor)|LED]] &ndash; "Language-sensitive programmer's EDitor" Screen oriented [[text editor]] and [[debugger]] *[[ND-NOTIS]] &ndash; Integrated, modular [[word processing]] and office application suite *[[NORTEXT]] &ndash; typesetting system integrated with ND-NOTIS and SIBAS *[[Lisp Machine Lisp]] &ndash; MIT Lisp machine lisp developed in a joint venture Racal-Norsk. *[[Technovision]] - CAD system developed in M端lheim an der Ruhr, Germany. <br/>Technovision was a modular CAD/CAM system which was internationally considered to be one of the best on the market. It was in part designed by Norsk Data Dietz GmbH. A special workstation named the Technostation was designed specifically for running Technovision. It was extremely well received by international press, and even won a design award.<ref> http://folk.uio.no/toresbe/nd/telemuseet/ </ref> *[[BIBDIA]] - Library system developed by Norsk Data Dietz GmbH in M端lheim an der Ruhr, Germany. <br/>BIBDIA was further developed by BiBer GmbH since 1992. The current WEB-based version is still running as a market leader in Germany and Switzerland. Along with the above listed applications two batch languages were included, called JEC and XCOM. JEC was used primarily as a simple batch job controller, whereas XCOM was used for much more involved routines such as operating system patches etc. Most of the application came in two different editions, one compiled for Nord-100-series and one compiled for Nord-1100 series. When ND discontinued NOTIS development in 1989, it was continued by NOTIS AS, which later changed its name to Maxware A point of note: the [[World Wide Web]] originated when [[Tim Berners-Lee]] wrote the [[Enquire]] program in Pascal on a Norsk Data NORD-10 running under SINTRAN III at [[CERN]].<ref> See Tim Berners-Lee's FAQ [http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html] or the [[ENQUIRE]] article</ref> == Notes == {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.norsk-data.no/ Norsk Data Forum] - a Norwegian site operated by ND ex-employees. * [http://www.sintran.com/sintran/sintran.html A commercial Norsk Data-related home page] * [http://www.ndpk.com/ Norsk Data Pakistan Private Limited] * [http://www.computer-archiv.de/COMP0169.HTM Computer-Archiv - Norsk Data] * [http://toresbe.at.ifi.uio.no/nd A Norsk Data page] operated by [[Tore Bekkedal]] * [http://folk.uio.no/toresbe/nd/history.html Norsk Data's history by Johnny Oddene] * [http://www.ndwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page NDWiki, The Norsk Data encyclopedia] * [http://www.bibdia.de BiBer GmbH] - a German Company founded by ND ex-employees.
