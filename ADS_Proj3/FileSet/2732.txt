It has hundreds of objects that can be [[Drag-and-drop|dragged]] on to the [[Workspace#Technology and Software|workspace]] and connected by wires or snapping them together. The workspace immediately solves the equations created and displays the results. MST Workshop is useful for creating animation in [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] (using [[OpenGL]]). MST Workshop uses components to process data. These components are connected when their terminals touch or when a virtual wire is connected between them. The interactive nature becomes apparent when components are connected. The color of the connected components changes from gray to a color specific to the value of the data passed through the connection. Components calculate in real time. Certain components that require a time frame can be started and stopped by buttons in the [[toolbar]]. Examples of time dependent components are the timer, oneshot, and the integration-over-time component. ==External links== * [http://home.comcast.net/~tpandolfi/site/?/home/ MST Workshop] — Official website [[Category:Visual programming languages]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23097</id> <title>MUMPS</title> <text>{{About|the programming language|other uses|Mumps (disambiguation)}} {{Infobox programming language | name = MUMPS | paradigm = [[Procedural programming|Procedural]] | year = 1966 | designer = [[Neil Pappalardo]] | latest_release_version = ANSI X11.1-1995 | latest_release_date = {{release date|1995|12|8}} | typing = typeless | influenced_by = [[JOSS]] | influenced = [[Profile Scripting Language|PSL]], [[Caché ObjectScript]] | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] }} '''MUMPS''' ([[Massachusetts General Hospital|'''M'''assachusetts General Hospital]] '''U'''tility '''M'''ulti-'''P'''rogramming '''S'''ystem), or alternatively '''M''', is a [[programming language]] created in the late 1960s, originally for use in the [[Health care|healthcare industry]]. It was designed for the production of multi-user [[database]]-driven applications. It predates [[C (programming language)|C]] and most other popular languages in current usage, and has very different syntax and terminology. It was largely adopted during the 1970s and early 1980s in healthcare and financial information systems/databases, and continues to be used by many of the same clients today. It is currently used in electronic health record systems as well as by multiple banking networks and online trading/investment services. ==History== MUMPS was developed by [[Neil Pappalardo]] and colleagues in Dr. Octo Barnett's animal lab at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) in [[Boston]] during 1966 and 1967. The original MUMPS system was, like Unix a few years later, built on a spare [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-7]]. Octo Barnett and [[Neil Pappalardo]] were also involved with MGH's planning for a Hospital Information System, obtained a [[backward compatible]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-9]], and began using MUMPS in the admissions cycle and laboratory test reporting. MUMPS was then an [[interpreted language]], yet even then, incorporated a [[hierarchical database]] file system to standardize interaction with the data. Some aspects of MUMPS can be traced from [[Rand Corporation]]'s [[JOSS]] through [[BBN Technologies|BBN]]'s [[TELCOMP]] and [[STRINGCOMP]]. The MUMPS team deliberately chose to include portability between machines as a design goal. Another feature, not widely supported for machines of the era, in [[operating system]]s or in [[hardware]], was [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], which was also built into the language itself. The portability was soon useful, as MUMPS was shortly adapted to a DEC [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-15]], where it lived for some time. MUMPS was developed with the support of a government research grant, and so MUMPS was released to the public domain (no longer a requirement for grants), and was soon ported to a number of other systems including the popular DEC [[PDP-8]], the [[Data General Nova]] and the DEC [[PDP-11]] and the [[Artronix]] [[PC12 minicomputer]]. Word about MUMPS spread mostly through the medical community, and by the early 1970s was in widespread use, often being locally modified for their own needs. By the early 1970s, there were many and varied implementations of MUMPS on a range of hardware platforms. The most widespread was [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s MUMPS-11 on the PDP-11, and [[Meditech]]'s [[MIIS (programming language)|MIIS]]. In 1972, many MUMPS users attended a conference which standardized the then-fractured language, and created the '''MUMPS Users Group''' and '''MUMPS Development Committee''' (MDC) to do so. These efforts proved successful; a standard was complete by 1974, and was approved, on September 15, 1977, as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard, X11.1-1977. At about the same time DEC launched DSM-11 (Digital Standard MUMPS) for the PDP-11. This quickly dominated the market, and became the reference implementation of the time. During the early 1980s several vendors brought MUMPS-based platforms that met the ANSI standard to market. The most significant were [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] with '''DSM''' (Digital Standard MUMPS), [[InterSystems]] with '''ISM''' (InterSystems M) on VMS and UNIX, and M/11+ on the PDP-11 platform. Other companies developed important MUMPS implementations: *Greystone Technology Corporation with a compiled version called [[GT.M]] *DataTree Inc. with an Intel PC based product called '''DTM''' *Micronetics Design Corporation with a product line called '''MSM''' for UNIX and Intel PC platforms (later ported to IBM's VM operating system) *Comp Consultants (later renamed MGlobal), a Houston-based company originally created '''CCSM''' on 6800, then 6809 processers, which later became '''MacMUMPS''', a [[Mac OS]] based product. They also worked on a the MGM MUMPS implementation. MGlobal also ported their implementation to the DOS platform where it ran as a guest operating system started from DOS. MGlobal MUMPS was the first commercial MUMPS for the IBM PC and the only Mac implementation. DSM-11 was superseded by '''VAX/DSM''' for the VAX/VMS platform, and that was ported to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] in two variants: '''DSM for OpenVMS''', and as '''DSM for Ultrix'''. This period also saw considerable MDC activity. The second revision of the ANSI standard for MUMPS (X11.1-1984) was approved on November 15, 1984. On November 11, 1990 the third revision of the ANSI standard (X11.1-1990) was approved. In 1992 the same standard was also adopted as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard 11756-1992. Use of '''M''' as an alternative name for the language was approved around the same time. On December 8,
