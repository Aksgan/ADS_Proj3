Acknowledge. Optional. Used by multi-master systems. The number of Attention Requests reflects that the STEbus aims to be simple. Single-master systems are the norm, but these signals allow systems to have secondary bus masters if needed. '''DATSTB*:''' Data Strobe. This is the primary signal in data transfer cycles. '''DATACK*:''' Data Acknowledge. A slave will assert this signal when to acknowledge the safe completion of a data transfer via the STEbus. '''TRFERR*:''' Transfer Error. A slave will assert this signal when acknowledging the erroneous completion of a data transfer via the STEbus. '''ADRSTB*:''' Address Strobe. This signal indicates the address bus is valid. A long time ago, this had some practical use in DRAM boards which could start strobing the address lines into DRAM chips before the data bus was ready. The STEbus spec was later firmed up to say that slaves were not allowed to start transfers until DATSTB* was ready, so ADRSTB* has become quite redundant. Nowadays, STEbus masters simply have to generate DATSTB*. ADRSTB* is often created from the same signal as DATSTB*. Slaves simply note when DATSTB* is valid (since the bus definition insists that the address will also be valid at the same time as the data. '''SYSCLK:''' System Clock. Fixed at 16 MHz. 50% duty cycle.

The simple idea utilizes the notion that if a node is on the wrong side of the fence, i.e. a node and its backup are both active, a STONITH message will force the offending node to power down. Two nodes in the same cluster trying to do exactly the same thing can have catastrophic results, such as if both nodes try writing to a shared storage resource. STONITH provides effective, if rather drastic, protection against these problems. ==External links== *[http://linux-ha.org/wiki/STONITH Definition from the Linux-HA Project] *[http://www.ourobengr.com/ha STONITH Deathmatch Explained (and Some Hints for Resource Agent Authors and Systems Engineers)] [[Category:Cluster computing]] {{compu-stub}} [[de:STONITH]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33044</id> <title>SUDAAN</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=June 2008}} '''SUDAAN''' is a statistical software package for the analysis of [[correlation|correlated data]], including correlated data encountered in complex [[sample survey]]s. SUDAAN originated in 1972 at [http://www.rti.org RTI International] (the trade name of Research Triangle Institute). ==Current version== [http://www.rti.org/sudaan/ SUDAAN Release 10.0], released in August 2008, is a single program consisting of a family of eleven [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic procedures]] used to analyze data from complex [[sample survey]]s and other observational and experimental studies involving repeated measures and [[Data clustering|cluster-correlated data]]. It provides estimates that account for complex design features of a study, including: * unequally [[Weight function|weighted]] or unweighted data * [[Stratified sampling|stratification]] * with- or without-replacement designs * multistage and cluster designs * repeated measures * general cluster-correlation (e.g., correlation due to multiple measures taken from patients) * multiply imputed analysis variables ==Example fields of use== SUDAAN enables the analysis of correlated data encountered in various fields of statistical research, including: * survey research ([[Random_digit_dialing|RDD]]/telephone studies, area sample designs, cluster and [[Stratified sampling|stratified designs]], list sampling) * [[clinical trial]]s (safety and efficacy data from multiple sites in multisite trials) * group or community randomized trials * observations on related family members * [[toxicology]] (observations on littermates) * multiple subjects within a cluster (patients within physician clinics or students within school classrooms) * [[social statistics]] * health outcomes research * longitudinal data analyses * repeated measures. ==Strengths== SUDAAN's strength lies it its ability to compute [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]]s of ratio estimates, [[mean]]s, totals, [[Regression analysis|regression coefficients]], and other statistics in accordance with the sample design, greatly increasing the accuracy and validity of results. Many, if not most, [[data set]]s require attention to [[correlation]] and [[weighting]], but few statistical software packages offer the user the opportunity to specify how data are correlated and weighted. For many years, SUDAAN remained the only broadly applicable software for analysis of correlated and weighted data. Currently Mplus offers similar capacities for a much broader set of models. Currently, all nine of SUDAAN's analytic procedures offer three popular robust variance estimation methods: * [[Taylor series]] linearization (generalized estimation equations [GEE] for regression models) * [[Resampling (statistics)|jackknife]] (with or without user-specified replicate weights) * balance repeated replication (BRR). ==Operating systems== SUDAAN functions on many computing platforms—including Windows 95/98/ME or NT/2000/XP, DOS, SUN/Solaris, and LINUX—either as a stand-alone statistical software tool, or in SAS-callable format (SAS Version 8 or 9). == External links == * [http://www.rti.org/sudaan/ SUDAAN home page] * [http://www.statmodel.com/resrchpap.shtml Mplus Complex Survey Data Project] {{Statistical software}} [[Category:Statistical software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33049</id> <title>SUNMOS</title> <text>'''SUNMOS''' ('''Sandia/UNM Operating System''') is an [[operating system]] jointly developed by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the Computer Science Department at the [[University of New Mexico]].
