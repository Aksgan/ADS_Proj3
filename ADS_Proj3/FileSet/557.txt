C/AL is a database specific programming language, and is primarily used for retrieving, inserting and modifying records in a [[Microsoft Dynamics NAV|Navision]] database. C/AL is simple but effective, and resembles the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal language]] it is based on. == Examples == === Hello World === This is the classic [[Hello world program|Hello World]] example. Since the [[C/SIDE]] (Client/Server Integrated Development Environment) does not have a console to output text, this example is made using a dialog box as the visual interface. <syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"> FOR i := 0 TO 10 DO MESSAGE('hello, world'); </syntaxhighlight> === Filtering and retrieving records === Variables in C/AL are not defined through code, but are defined via the variable declaration menu in the C/AL editor. In this example ''Item'' is assumed to be a variable of type Record. <syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"> IF Item.GET('31260210') THEN MESSAGE('Item name is: %1',Item."Description"); Item.RESET; item.SETFILTER(...); </syntaxhighlight> . === Looping and data manipulation=== Looping over a recordset and modifying the individual records is achieved with only a few lines of code. <!-- There was no language setting for "C/AL". Used "pascal"-setting instead. Looks okay. --> <syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"> Item.SETRANGE("Blocked",TRUE); IF Item.FINDSET THEN REPEAT IF Item."Profit" < 10 THEN BEGIN Item."Profit %" := 20; Item.MODIFY(TRUE); END; UNTIL Item.NEXT = 0; Item.MODIFYALL("Blocked",FALSE); </syntaxhighlight> ==See also== *[[Microsoft Dynamics NAV]] ==External links== *[http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/nav/default.mspx/ Official site ] *[http://www.mibuso.com/ Microsoft Dynamics Development Community ] {{Pascal programming language family}} {{compu-prog-stub}} {{DEFAULTSORT:C/Al}} [[Category:Pascal programming language family]] [[Category:Query languages]] [[nl:C/AL]] [[ru:C/AL]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4890</id> <title>CA-Cricket Presents</title> <text>'''CA-Cricket Presents''' (formerly '''Xerox Presents''' originally from Xerox Desktop Software) was a [[presentation program]] developed for [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] by Cricket Software.

It aims to facilitate dissemination of information about CAAD amongst Asian Schools of Architecture, Planning, Engineering, & Building Sciences in Asia, and encourage the exchange of software, courseware, experiences and staff/students amongst schools. It conducts several activities to identify research and development needs specific to CAAD education and initiate collaboration to satisfy them, and promote research and teaching in CAAD which enhances creativity rather than simply production technologies. == Organisation == === Membership === Membership to the association is open to individuals (teachers, researchers, students, and architects) and institutions (universities, libraries), either as active member (someone who attends the conference) or as sponsor member. Typically, one becomes an individual member through attending and registering at a CAADRIA conference, or by applying for membership to the secretariat. Institutions in Asia, Australia and New Zealand can apply for institutioanl membership and gain access to CumInCAD database. Membership lasts for one year, and gives access to digital proceedings of CAADRIA, email announcements of forthcoming events of interest and one vote at the Annual General Meeting of CAADRIA. === Executive Committee === CAADRIA is governed by an Administrative Council elected by the membership. Responsibility for organisation, administration and guidance of the association is delegated to the Executive Committee by virtue of the election of the officers. Membership of the Council is restricted to members working in countries within the Asia Pacific region; term of office is two years. There is an annual general meeting (normally convened during the annual conference) at which the business of the association is agreed by the membership. This forum is considered the highest level of authority and shall be the only one with the power to amend the charter of CAADRIA. === Secretariat === The Secretariat is composed of volunteer staff, with a limited budget being made available through membership dues and supervised by the Executive Committee. ==== List of Presidents ==== {| class="wikitable" !Period !Name !Institution |- |2010 - |Andrew I-Kang Li |The Chinese University of Hong Kong |- |2008-2010 |Marc Aurel Schnabel |University of Sydney, Australia |- |2004-2008 |Bharat Dave |University of Melbourne, Australia |- |2002-2004 |Aleppo Yu-Tung Liu |National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan |- |1998-2002 |Jin-Yeu Tsou |The Chinese University of Hong Kong |- |1996-1998 |Thomas Kvan |University of Hong Kong |} == Activities == === List of Conferences === The annual conference is the main event organised under the auspices of the association.
