The circuit functions as if the nodes were physically connected with an electrical circuit. The bit delay is constant during a connection, as opposed to packet switching, where packet queues may cause varying [[packet transfer delay]]. Each circuit cannot be used by other callers until the circuit is released and a new connection is set up. Even if no actual communication is taking place in a dedicated circuit that channel remains unavailable to other users. Channels that are available for new calls to be set up are said to be idle. [[Virtual circuit switching]] is a [[packet switching]] technology that may emulate circuit switching, in the sense that the connection is established before any packets are transferred, and that packets are delivered in order. There is a common misunderstanding that circuit switching is used only for connecting voice circuits (analog or digital). The concept of a dedicated path persisting between two communicating parties or nodes can be extended to signal content other than voice. Its advantage is that it provides for non-stop transfer without requiring packets and without most of the overhead traffic usually needed, making maximal and optimal use of available bandwidth for that communication. The disadvantage of inflexibility tends to reserve it for specialized applications, particularly with the overwhelming [[wiktionary:proliferation| proliferation]] of internet-related technology. {{Multiplex_techniques}} ==The call== For [[Call processing|call setup]] and control (and other administrative purposes), it is possible to use a separate dedicated [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signalling]] channel from the end node to the network. [[ISDN]] is one such service that uses a separate signalling channel while Plain Old Telephone Service ([[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]) does not. The method of establishing the connection and monitoring its progress and termination through the network may also utilize a [[separate channel signaling|separate control channel]] as in the case of links between telephone exchanges which use [[Signalling System 7|CCS7]] packet-switched signalling protocol to communicate the call setup and control information and use [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]] to transport the actual circuit data. Early [[telephone exchanges]] are a suitable example of circuit switching. The subscriber would ask the operator to connect to another subscriber, whether on the same exchange or via an inter-exchange link and another operator. In any case, the end result was a physical electrical connection between the two subscribers' telephones for the duration of the call. The copper wire used for the connection could not be used to carry other calls at the same time, even if the subscribers were in fact not talking and the line was silent. ==Compared to datagram packet switching== Since the first days of the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] it has been possible to [[Multiplexing|multiplex]] multiple connections over the same physical conductor, but nonetheless each channel on the multiplexed link was either dedicated to one call at a time, or it was idle between calls. With circuit switching, and virtual circuit switching, a route is reserved from source to destination. The entire message is sent in order so that it does not have to be reassembled at the destination. Circuit switching can be relatively inefficient because capacity is wasted on connections which are set up but are not in continuous use (however momentarily). On the other hand, the connection is immediately available and capacity is guaranteed until the call is disconnected. Circuit switching contrasts with [[packet switching]], which splits traffic data (for instance, digital representation of sound, or computer data) into chunks, called packets, that are routed over a shared network. Packet switching is the process of segmenting a message/data to be transmitted into several smaller packets. Each packet is labeled with its destination and a sequence number (for ordering related packets), precluding the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination. Each is dispatched and many may go via different routes. At the destination, the original message is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet number. Datagram packet switching networks do not require a circuit to be established and allow many pairs of nodes to communicate almost simultaneously over the same channel. == Examples of circuit switched networks == * [[public switched telephone network|Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)]] * [[ISDN]] B-channel * [[Circuit Switched Data]] (CSD) and [[High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data]] (HSCSD) service in cellular systems such as [[GSM]] * [[Datakit]] * [[X.21]] (Used in the German [[DATEX-L]] and Scandinavian [[DATEX]] circuit switched data network) ==See also== * [[Packet switching]] * [[Message switching]] * [[Call (telecommunications)]] * [[Clos network]] * [[Time-Driven Switching]] * [[Connection-oriented]] ==External links== * [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.10/atm.html ''Netheads vs Bellheads'' by Steve Steinberg] * [http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~mngroup/projects/mpls/documents/thesis/node8.html University of Virginia] * [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3439.txt RFC 3489 ''Some Internet Architectural Guidelines and Philopsophy''] {{Channel access methods}} [[Category:Teletraffic]] [[Category:Network architecture]] [[Category:Physical layer protocols]] [[ar:تحويل عبر دارة]] [[ca:Commutació de circuits]] [[cs:Přepojování okruhů]] [[de:Leitungsvermittlung]] [[es:Conmutacion de circuitos]] [[fa:مدارگزینی]] [[fr:Commutation de circuits]] [[ko:회선 교환]] [[id:Circuit switching]] [[it:Multiplazione#Multiplazione deterministica]] [[he:מיתוג מעגלים]] [[ms:Pensuisan litar]] [[nl:Circuitgeschakeld netwerk]] [[ja:回線交換]] [[pl:Komutacja łączy]] [[pt:Comutação de circuitos]] [[fi:Piirikytkentä]] [[sv:Kretskopplade nätverk]] [[uk:Мережа з комутацією каналів]] [[ur:دورانی_بدیل]] [[vi:Nối chuyển mạch]] [[zh:电路交换]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6298</id> <title>Circumpolar Health Bibliographic Database</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} [[Image:Msc summer.jpg|thumb|right|University of Calgary]] The '''Circumpolar Health Bibliographic Database''' (CHBD) is a free<ref>{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:kgZqMgE9MxUJ:www.lib.flinders.edu.au/resources/databases/sub/hrd.pdf+%22Circumpolar+Health+Bibliographic+Database%22+journal&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=19&gl=us&client=firefox-a|title=Databases for Research in Health|last=Tyndall|first=Jess|date=February 2008|publisher=Flinders University, Australia|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> [[electronic database]] of abstracts, citations, geographic and subject indexing, library codes and their links to full text publications, both peer-reviewed and gray literature.<ref name="ijch">{{cite journal|date=2007|title=Circumpolar Health Bibliographic Database|journal=International Journal of Circumpolar Health|publisher=ijch.fi|volume=66|issue=3|pages=278|url=http://ijch.fi/issues/663/663_News.pdf}}</ref> Established in 2007, it contains more than four thousand records that describe human health in the [[circumpolar Arctic|circumpolar]] region.
