plant-level and enterprise systems is no longer an option for manufacturing and energy companies if they want to remain competitive. Convergence of the IT world with automation and process controls greatly helps in this effort by providing economically and technically competitive solutions. However, the sharing of process information within and between networks must be done in a way that aligns with the overall security policies of the enterprise.<ref>[http://csrp.inl.gov/documents/OPC%20Security%20WP2.pdf Digital Bond from the British Columbia Institute of Technology, "OPC Security White Paper #2: OPC Exposed"], by Byres Research, 13 November 2007</ref> This is why system integrators must find customized solutions that fit the specific company's needs and goals.<ref>[http://www.automation.com/pdf_articles/Process_Control_Network_Security_with_OPC_Tunneling.pdf Automation.com, "OPC NetBrokerTM for Industrial Network Security and connectivity - Tunneling Process Data Securely Through Firewalls - A Solution To OPC - DCOM Connectivity"], by Integration Objects, 2007</ref> == Relevance of knowledge management == Many enterprises across various industries face the same issue - important resources such as [[Data (computing)|data]], [[information]], and [[knowledge]] are embedded in computer systems, documentation, and in the minds of individuals across an organization but accessing it can be both extremely difficult and time-consuming.<ref>[http://dssresources.com/papers/features/demarest07/demarest02172007.html DSSResources.com, "Knowledge Management: An Introduction"], by M. Demarest, 17 February 2007</ref> However, by using intelligent [[Computing platform|computer platforms]] to not only capture and integrate this knowledge, but analyze, organize and store it as well, users can monitor and manage operations and performances and effectively make safe and smart decisions rapidly to improve results.

For example, in case of abnormal plant conditions, knowledge management platforms allow an operator to identify the [[root cause]] of the problem and the correct action that should be taken by automatically reviewing the stored and analyzed data found in the system.<ref>[http://www.pcai.com/Paid/Issues/PCAI-Online-Issues/17.1_OL/New_Folder/TrT4o3/17.1_PA/PCAI-17.1-Paid-pg.28-Art3.htm PC AI Magazine, "Abnormal Condition Management with Real-Time Expert System and Object Technology"], by Hamdy Noureldin and Fulvio Roveta, 2003</ref> Knowledge management can be a strategic asset necessary for an organization to remain competitive.<ref>[[Knowledge management]], Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, 22 March 2010</ref> == Notes == <references/> == External links == *[http://www.integrationobjects.com/ Integration Objects' website] *[http://www.ogfj.com/index/article-display/0246880288/articles/oil-gas-financial-journal/software-technology/business-solutions/integration-objects.html Article: "Saudi Aramco Abqaiq Plant partners with Integration Objects to optimize plant operations" in the Oil&Gas Financial Journal] *[http://www.opcfoundation.org/ The OPC Foundation] *[http://www.mimosa.org/ MIMOSA - Machinery Information Management Open Systems Alliance] [[Category:Interoperability]] [[Category:Enterprise application integration]] [[Category:Interoperable communications]] [[Category:Software architecture]] [[Category:Knowledge management]] [[Category:Companies of Tunisia]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18702</id> <title>Intel Concurrent Collections</title> <text>'''Intel Concurrent Collections''' (known as CnC) is a [[programming language]] and [[software framework]] developed by [[Intel]] to express [[Parallelism_(computing)|parallelism]] in applications. ==External links== * [http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-concurrent-collections-for-cc/ Concurrent Collections Project website at Intel WhatIf site] [[Category:Parallel_computing]] [[Category:Concurrent_programming_languages]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18713</id> <title>Intel Modular Server System</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|orphan =November 2010|wikify=November 2010|expert =November 2010}} [[File:Intel Modular Server System - MFSYS25 Chassis.jpg|thumb|Front view of the Intel Modular Server System’s MFSYS25 Chassis.

The Intel Modular Server System consists of an Intel Modular Server Chassis, up to six diskless Compute Blades, an integrated [[storage area network]] (SAN), and three to five Service Modules. The system was formerly announced in January, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Modine|first=Austin|title=Intel launches modular server platform for SMBs|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/11/intel_modular_server_platform/|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=21 November 2010|date=January 28, 2008}}</ref> The server is aimed at small to medium businesses with "50 to 300 employees".<ref>{{cite web|last=Gonsalves|first=Antone|title=Intel Offers Partners Modular Server System for Small Businesses |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/processors/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=205602960&cid=RSSfeed_IWK_News|work=[[InformationWeek]]|accessdate=November 21, 2010|date=January 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Urquidi|first=Julio|title=Intel’s 24-Core, 14-Drive Modular Server Reviewed |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/mfsys25-smb-server,2138.html|work=[[Tom's Hardware]]|accessdate=November 21, 2010|date=January 30, 2009}}</ref> == Intel Modular Server Chassis == The Modular Server Chassis comes in two versions; the MFSYS25 and MFSYS35. The key difference between these two versions is that the MFSYS25’s integrated [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) bay accommodates fourteen 2.5” HDDs, while the MFSYS35’s integrated HDD bay accommodates six 3.5” HDDs. Both versions have two Main Fan Modules, six Compute Blade bays, five Service Module slots, and up to four power supply units in an [[N+1 redundancy|N+1 configuration]]. == Service Modules == There are three types of Service Modules used in the Intel Modular Server System; the Storage Control Module, the Ethernet Switch Module, and the Chassis Management Module. An Intel Modular Server Chassis accommodates one Chassis Management Module, up to two Storage Control Modules, and up to two Ethernet Switch Modules. The addition of a second Ethernet Switch Module and/or Storage Control Module permits high availability and load balancing. The Chassis Management Module is used to manage the Intel Modular Server Chassis’ integrated SAN, the other two to four Service Modules, and the Compute Blades. The Control Module supports Intel Matrix [[RAID]], and manages the RAID partitioning of the HDDs in the integrated HDD bay; as well as the creation, assignment and destruction of volumes on the HDDs’ partitions. The Ethernet Switch Module is a managed [[Gigabit Ethernet]] switch which provides connectivity to external Ethernet networks to the installed Compute Blades. == Compute Blades == There are two types of Compute Blade which can be used, in any combination, in the Intel Modular Server Enclosure ; the MFS5000SI and the MFS5520VI. Both Compute Modules are dual-socket systems, which each have an integrated SAS HBA (for accessing volumes on the Integrated SAN), an integrated Gigabit Ethernet port, and integrated graphics. The Compute Blades are referred to as ‘’Compute Modules’’ in Intel literature. The MFS5000SI Compute Blade uses up to two Intel Xeon 5100, 5200, 5300 or 5400 processors; and supports up to 32GB of RAM, running at either 1066MHz or 1333MHz. The MFS5520VI Compute Blade uses up to two Intel Xeon 5500 or
