Code entered into the IDE is compiled to an intermediate form, and this intermediate form is immediately interpreted on demand within the IDE.<ref name="GBvsQB"/> It can run under nearly all versions of [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], or through [[DOSBox]]/[[DOSEMU]], on [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penguinpetes.com/b2evo/index.php?title=howto_play_with_your_old_qbasic_programs|title=HOWTO Play With Your Old QBasic Programs on Linux|date=2007-03-31|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref> For its time, QBasic provided a state-of-the-art IDE, including a [[debugger]] with features such as on-the-fly expression evaluation and code modification. Like QuickBASIC, but unlike earlier versions of Microsoft BASIC, QBasic is a [[structured programming]] language, supporting constructs such as [[subroutines]] and [[while loop]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qbasicnews.com/qboho/qcksub.shtml|title=QBASIC Manual: SUB...END SUB Statement QuickSCREEN|date=|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qbasicnews.com/qboho/qckwend.shtml|title=QBASIC Manual: WHILE...WEND Statement QuickSCREEN|date=|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref> [[Line number]]s, a concept often associated with BASIC, are supported for compatibility, but are not considered good form, having been replaced by descriptive [[line label]]s.<ref name="GBvsQB">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|title=Differences Between GW-BASIC and QBasic|date=2003-05-12|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref> QBasic has limited support for user-defined data types ([[record (computer science)|structures]]), and several primitive types used to contain strings of text or numeric data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qbasicnews.com/qboho/qcktype.shtml|title=QBASIC Manual: TYPE Statement QuickSCREEN|date=|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qbasicnews.com/qboho/qckadvr@l8207.shtml|title=QBASIC Manual: Limits - Names, Strings, and Numbers|date=|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref> ==History== QBasic was intended as a replacement for [[GW-BASIC]]. It was based on the earlier [[Microsoft QuickBASIC compiler|QuickBASIC]] 4.5 compiler but without QuickBASIC's compiler and linker elements. Version 1.0 was shipped together with [[MS-DOS]] 5.0 and higher, as well as [[Windows 95]], [[Windows NT 3.1|Windows NT 3.x]], and [[Windows NT 4.0]]. [[IBM]] recompiled QBasic and included it in [[IBM PC-DOS|PC-DOS]] 5.x, as well as [[OS/2]] 2.0 onwards.<ref name="name">{{cite web|url=http://www.emsps.com/oldtools/msbasv.htm#qbasic|title=Microsoft BASIC version information|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> [[eComStation]], descended from OS/2 code, includes QBasic 1.0. QBasic 1.1 is included with MS-DOS 6.x, and, without EDIT, in [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]]. Starting with [[Windows 2000]], Microsoft no longer includes QBasic with their operating systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258265|title=QBasic Missing from Windows 2000|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> (However, some localized versions of [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]] still have it,and it can be given out as freeware.) QBasic (as well as the built-in [[MS-DOS Editor]]) is backward compatible with DOS releases prior to 5.0 (down to at least DOS 3.20). However, if used on any [[Intel 8088|8088]]/[[Intel 8086|8086]] computers, or on some [[Intel 80286|80286]] computers, the QBasic program may run very slowly, or perhaps not at all, due to its memory size. Until MS-DOS 7, MS-DOS Editor required QBasic. The "edit.com" program simply starts QBasic in editor mode only, and this mode can also be entered by running QBASIC.EXE with the /EDIT switch (i.e., command line "QBASIC /EDIT"). ==Examples== QBasic came complete with four pre-written example programs. These were "[[Nibbles (computer game)|Nibbles]]" (a variant of the [[Snake (video game)|Snake]] game), "[[Gorillas (computer game)|Gorillas]]", an [[Artillery game]], "MONEY MANAGER", a personal finance manager and "RemLine", a GW-BASIC code line-number-removing program.<ref name="GBvsQB"/> ==="[[Hello, World!]]"=== <source lang="qbasic"> PRINT "Hello, World!" </source> ===Simple game=== This program challenges the user to guess a randomly selected number within the 1-10 range, without offering the usual hints of "higher"/"lower": <source lang="qbasic"> CLS PRINT "Guess My Number" INPUT "Would you like to play"; choice$ 'An input statement, that takes what the user inputs... choice$ = UCASE$(choice$) ' makes the input completely uppercase (fkld ---> FKLD) IF choice$ <> "YES" AND choice$ <> "Y" THEN ' and decides whether or not they want to play: END END IF guesses% = 5 ' Set up number of guess remaining RANDOMIZE TIMER ' Sets up the random number generator target% = INT(RND * 10) + 1 WHILE guesses% > 0 INPUT "Guess a number: ", guess% ' Takes user input (the guess) IF guess% = target% THEN ' Determines if the guess was correct PRINT "You win!" END ELSE guesses% = guesses% - 1 PRINT "Sorry, please try again. You have ";guesses%;" guesses left." END IF WEND PRINT "You ran out of guesses, the number was "; target% END </source> ==Easter egg== QBasic has a little-known [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]]. To see it, press and hold {{keypress|Left CTRL|Left SHIFT|Left ALT}} and {{keypress|Right CTRL|Right SHIFT|Right ALT}} simultaneously after running QBasic at the DOS prompt but before the title screen loads: this lists ''The Team'' of programmers.<ref name="name">{{cite web|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/817.html|title=QBasic - Developer Credits|date=1999-07-23|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> Note that on modern computers, it is much too fast to perform. It is best done on an old PC (preferably one with a working [[Turbo button]], with the switch on to slow the CPU to 4.77 MHz) or in an emulator like [[Bochs]] or [[DOSBox]] which can be slowed down. ==See also== {{wikibooks|QBasic}} * [[DarkBASIC]] * [[FreeBASIC]] * [[Just Basic]] * [[PowerBASIC]] * [[PureBasic]] * [[QB64]] * [[True Basic]] * [[Visual Basic]] * [[Blitz Basic]] * [[Liberty BASIC]] * [[Run BASIC]] * [[SmallBASIC]] ==References== {{reflist|1}} ==External links== *[http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_s/1.0/w95/en-us/olddos.exe Download QBASIC 1.1 from Microsoft] (included in the "Old MS-DOS Utilities" part of [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/135315 Windows 95 CD-ROM Extras]) *[http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/express/express.shtml QB Express - Online magazine about QBasic programming] *[http://www.qbasicstation.com The QBasic Station ] - Created in 1997 by Jack Thomson, it is one of the oldest, but still active, QBasic sites on the web. {{BASIC}} [[Category:BASIC interpreters]] [[Category:Discontinued Microsoft BASICs]] [[Category:Procedural programming languages]] [[Category:Structured programming languages]] [[Category:DOS software]] [[Category:Articles with example BASIC code]] [[bs:QBasic]] [[bg:QBasic]] [[ca:QBasic]] [[cs:QBasic]] [[de:QBasic]] [[es:QBASIC]] [[fa:کیو بیسیک]] [[fr:QBasic]] [[ko:큐베이직]] [[hr:QBasic]] [[it:QBASIC]] [[ms:QBasic]] [[nl:QBasic]] [[ja:QBasic]] [[no:QBasic]] [[pl:QBasic]] [[pt:QBasic]] [[ru:QBasic]] [[simple:QBasic]] [[sr:QBasic]] [[fi:QBasic]] [[sv:QBasic]] [[tl:QBasic]] [[tg:QBASIC]] [[zh:QBASIC]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30639</id> <title>QCDOC</title> <text>The '''QCDOC''', ''[[Quantum chromodynamics|Quantum ChromoDynamics]] On a Chip'', is a [[supercomputer]] technology focusing on using relatively cheap [[Low-power electronics|low power]] [[Microprocessor|processing elements]] to produce a [[Massive
