up capacity until they were able to decrypt a substantial proportion of German Enigma traffic. This ability lasted until December 1938 when two additional rotors were introduced,<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 c) pp. 242–43</ref> although Rejewski did solve their wiring. ===Early indicator procedures=== The message indicator in the 1930s was a 6-letter sequence comprising the three letters of the message key, enciphered twice using the initial rotor position given in the ground setting (e.g., ''RAO'').<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 171</ref> If the 3-letter message key chosen by the operator was ''IHL'', he would encipher this after having set the rotors to ''RAO''. The resultant ciphertext, say ''OTUNSD'', would be transmitted, followed by the message, enciphered using message key ''IHL''. The receiving operator would use the ground setting ''RAO'' to decipher the first six letters, yielding ''IHLIHL''. The receiving operator would then decipher the message, using message key ''IHL''. In the example of ''OTUNSD'' being the enciphered indicator, it is known that the first letter ''O'' and the fourth letter ''N'' represent the same letter, enciphered three positions apart in the scrambler sequence. Similarly with ''T'' and ''S'' in the second and fifth positions, and ''U'' and ''D'' in the third and sixth. Rejewski exploited this fact by collecting a sufficient set of messages enciphered with the same ground key, and assembling three tables for the 1,4, the 2,5, and the 3,6 pairings. Each of these might look something like the following: {|class="wikitable" | border=1 | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |- ! First letter | A||B||C||D||E||F||G||H||I||J||K||L||M||N||O||P||Q||R||S||T||U||V||W||X||Y||Z |- ! Fourth letter | X||F||E||A||R||B||S||L||H||Q||I||G||C||V||D||Z||W||K||M||N||J||U||O||Y||T||P |} A path from one first letter to the corresponding fourth letter, then from that letter as the first letter to its corresponding fourth letter, and so on until the first letter recurs, traces out a [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle group]].<ref>Also referred to as a ''box shape'' or a ''chain''. See [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Alexander]] (''c.'' 1945) Ch. II Para. 4</ref> The above table contains four cycle groups. {| class="wikitable" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |- ! Cycle group starting at A (12 links) | (A, X, Y, T, N, V, U, J, Q, W, O, D, A) |- ! Cycle group starting at B (2 links) | (B, F, B) |- ! Cycle group starting at C (10 links) | (C, E, R, K, I, H, L, G, S, M, C) |- !

This reduced the number of possibilities for the indicator setting from 10,000 trillion to 105,456.<ref>105,456 is the number of possible rotor settings (17,576) multiplied by the six ''wheel orders'' that were possible at this time. [[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) p. 153</ref> They therfore set about creating a ''card catalog'' of these cycle patterns.<ref>[[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Alexander]] (''c.'' 1945) Ch. II Para. 4</ref> [[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]], in 1934 or 1935, devised a machine to facilitate this task, called a ''[[cyclometer]]''. This "comprised two sets of rotors... connected by wires through which electric current could run. Rotor N in the second set was three letters out of phase with respect to rotor N in the first set, whereas rotors L and M in the second set were always set the same way as rotors L and M in the first set".<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 e) p. 285</ref> Preparation of this catalog, using the cyclometer, was, said Rejewski, "laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready, obtaining daily keys was a question of [some fifteen] minutes".<ref name=RejewskiAppxC242>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 c) p. 242</ref> However, on 1 November 1937, the Germans changed the Enigma [[reflector (cipher machine)|reflector]], necessitating the production of a new catalog&mdash;"a task which [says Rejewski] consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year's time".<ref name=RejewskiAppxC242/> This cycle-pattern method stopped working for German naval Enigma messages on 1 May 1937, when the indicator procedure was changed to one involving special codebooks (see [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Navy 3-rotor Enigma|German Navy 3-rotor Enigma]] below.<ref name = MahonP13>Mahon (1945) p. 13</ref> On 15 September 1938 the indicator procedure for the German Army and Air Force was changed.<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 173</ref> It now comprised a 9-letter sequence. The setting sheet no longer provided the indicator setting. Instead, the operator chose three letters, which were sent unenciphered, as the first three of the nine letters. These constituted the indicator setting for the next six letters, the 3-letter message key, which was still sent twice.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 36, 60</ref><ref>Wilcox (2001) p. 6</ref> ===Perforated sheets=== [[File:Płachta Zygalskiego - decrypting Enigma.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Perforated sheets|Zygalski sheet]]]] {{main|Zygalski sheets}} Although the cycle pattern method no longer worked, the inclusion of the enciphered message key twice, gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst [[Henryk Zygalski]] was able to exploit. Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key enciphered to the same letter on both occasions. These occurrences were called ''samiczki''<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 54; 63, note 2</ref> (in English, ''females''—a term later used at Bletchley Park<ref>[[Gordon Welchman]] suggests that this arose from the nomenclature for plugs (male) and sockets (female) because the success of this method depended on a number of overlying sheets having their apertures in register. Welchman (1984) p. 72</ref><ref>[[Hugh Sebag-Montefiore]] cites [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox]], who attended the 25 July 1939 Warsaw conference, as having given a more frankly biological etymology, discreetly veiled in French. Sebag-Montefiore (2004) p. 362</ref>). Only a limited number of scrambler settings would give rise to females, and these would have been identifiable from the card catalog. If the first six letters of the ciphertext were '''''S'''ZV'''S'''IK'', this would be termed a 1-4 female; if
