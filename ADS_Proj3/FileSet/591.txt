website. Retroactive digitization of earlier conferences is ongoing. In 1997, the association began to hold most conferences in conjunction with the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences’ annual Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities. == Publications == CAIS-ACSI has been publishing since its inception and even before the Letters Patent were issued the first two issues of a projected quarterly journal entitled Information Science in Canada appeared in Winter and Spring of 1970,. For lack of sufficient subscribers, the journal ceased after production of the second issue. From 1971 to 1983, CAIS published 25 numbers of a Newsletter. intended for ephemeral or time related information, covering recent developments. In 1976, the association began publishing Canadian Journal of Information Science/ La Revue canadienne des sciences de l’information, as an annual publication directed at IT and library practitioners. The journal became a peer reviewed quarterly beginning with volume 12 in 1986. In 1993, with volume 18, the title was changed to Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science/ La Revue canadienne des sciences de l’information et de bibliothéconomie (CJILS) The change of name occurred when the Canadian Library Association ceased publishing Canadian Library Journal. In 1987, with volume 12, the association began publishing CJILSl with the University of Toronto Press (UTP). == References == {{Reflist}} *Nilsen, Kirsti. 2007. “The Canadian Association for Information Science: A Look at Its Thirty-five Year History.” The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science 31 (2):163-177. *Nilsen, Kirsti. 2010. “Thirty-seven CAIS-ACSI Conferences, 1973-2009.” The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science 34 (2):131-159. == External links == * CAIS-ACSI [http://www.cais-acsi.ca/] [[Category:Library associations]] [[Category:Organizations based in Canada]] [[Category:Associations]] {{Library-stub}} {{Canada-org-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5407</id> <title>Canadian Computing Competition</title> <text>The '''Canadian Computing Competition''' ('''CCC''') is a national [[Computer programming|programming]] [[competition]] for secondary school students in [[Canada]]. Sponsored by the [[University of Waterloo]], the CCC takes place once a year. Stage 1 is a written at high schools and can be written in the [[programming language]] of the students' choice, with only a few, such as [[Maple (software)|Maple]] and [[Mathematica]], disallowed. There are two levels of problems presented, Junior and Senior. The top 20 (or so) students in the Senior division are invited to the [[University of Waterloo]] to participate in Stage 2. In Stage 2 students are restricted to languages permitted at the [[International Olympiad in Informatics|IOI]], which currently includes only [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. The top 4 students at Stage 2 are selected for the Canadian IOI team. (Since 2005 the contest has also been offered to students in [[Hong Kong]], and since 2007 to students in [[Beijing]] also, but they are not eligible for the Canadian IOI team.) In addition, the top two students (for both Junior and Senior) of each region receives a plaque and $100. In case of a tie, $100 is awarded to each student, rather than splitting the $200 among more than two individuals; this is rare however. The regions are West (BC to Manitoba), Ontario North and East, Ontario Metro, Ontario Central and West, and Quebec and Atlantic. The questions in the CCC are algorithmic in nature, designed to test a student's ability to design and code algorithms rather than their knowledge of [[Application programming interface|APIs]] or language-specific features. Stage 2 is much more difficult than Stage 1, but is still much easier than the IOI. The problems generally have memory, time or stack constraints (especially in recursion) forcing the programmer to find efficient solutions; inefficient solutions are unlikely to earn full marks. ==Contest Layout== ===Stage 1=== The contest is three hours long. There are five questions, each worth 15 points, for a total of 75. The grading is done by teachers, who then send the results to Waterloo to be verified. The tasks proposed in the Senior Division include some two or three 'implementation' tasks , and the final two are IOI - level Questions :) ===Stage 2=== At Stage 2, the contest is two days long, with three hours to do three questions each day (in 2009 four hours were given). There are six questions, each worth 100 points, for a total of 600. This score is added to four times the Stage 1 score (for a total of 900 points) to determine a final selection index for the IOI team. Bronze, silver, and gold medals are awarded, with each competitor receiving a medal; winners of gold medals proceed to the IOI. Cash prizes of $500 (gold), $250 (silver), and $100 (bronze) are awarded also. ==See also== * [[Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing]] * [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] * [[DWITE]] ==External links== *[http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/ccc/ CCC Website] *[http://access.mmhs.ca/ccc/index.htm Solutions to Stage One Problems] [[Category:Programming contests]] {{computing-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5410</id> <title>Canadian Information Processing Society</title> <text>{{Infobox company| company_name = Canadian Information Processing Society<br>L'Association Canadienne de l'Informatique | company_logo = <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CIPS.gif|center|150px|CIPS]] -->| company_type = [[Not for profit]] | foundation = 1958 | location = [[Mississauga, Ontario]], [[Canada]] | key_people = Trekker Armstrong, I.S.P., ITCP/IP3P, is the Chair of the Canadian Council of Information Technology Professionals for CIPS.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cips.ca/node/211 | title = Getting to Know the New CIPS CCITP Chair, Trekker Armstrong, I.S.P., ITCP/IP3P | publisher = CIPS Chartered under [[Industry Canada]] | archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate = March 29, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> | industry = Professional Society | num_employees = 5 (excluding volunteers) | products = [[Professionalism]] | homepage = [http://www.cips.ca www.cips.ca] }} The '''Canadian Information Processing Society''' (C.I.P.S) is the [[Information Technology]] professional society in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/ccc/srch/nvgt.do?sbPrtl=&prtl=1&estblmntNo=123456011536&profile=cmpltPrfl&profileId=21&app=sold&lang=eng | title = Government of Canada, Industry Canada, CIPS - National Office - Complete Profile | publisher = Government of Canada, Industry Canada | archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate = March 29, 2010 }}</ref> The society certifies and regulates the [[Information Systems Professional]] (I.S.P) designation in most provinces.
