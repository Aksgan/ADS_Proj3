The last of FreeBSD 2, 2.2.8-RELEASE, was announced on November 29, 1998. First FreeBSD to be claimed legally free of AT&T UNIX code with approval of Novell. ===FreeBSD 3=== Announced on October 16, 1998. 3.5-RELEASE was announced on June 24, 2000. ===FreeBSD 4=== 4.0-RELEASE appeared in March 2000 and the last 4-STABLE branch release was 4.11 in January 2005 supported until January 31, 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2006-October/004111.html |title=FreeBSD 4.x EoL announcement}}</ref> FreeBSD 4 was a favorite operating system for ISPs and [[web hosting service|web hosting providers]] during the first ''.com'' bubble, and is widely regarded as one of the most stable and high performance operating systems of the whole Unix lineage. Among the new features of FreeBSD 4, [[Kqueue|<code>kqueue(2)</code>]] was introduced (which is now part of other major BSD systems). ===FreeBSD 5=== After almost three years of development, the first 5.0-RELEASE in January 2003 was widely anticipated, featuring support for advanced multiprocessor and application threading, and for the [[UltraSPARC]] and [[IA-64]] platforms. The first 5-STABLE release was 5.3 (5.0 through 5.2.1 were cut from ''-CURRENT''). The last release from the 5-STABLE branch was 5.5 in May 2006. The largest architectural development in FreeBSD 5 was a major change in the low-level kernel locking mechanisms to enable better symmetric multi-processor (SMP) support. This released much of the kernel from the MP lock, which is sometimes called the ''[[Giant lock]]''. More than one process could now execute in kernel mode at the same time. Other major changes included an ''M'':''N'' native threading implementation called [[Kernel Scheduled Entities]]. In principle this is similar to [[Scheduler Activations]]. Starting with FreeBSD 5.3, KSE was the default threading implementation until it was replaced with a 1:1 implementation in FreeBSD 7.0. FreeBSD 5 also significantly changed the block I/O layer by implementing the [[GEOM]] modular disk I/O request transformation framework contributed by [[Poul-Henning Kamp]]. GEOM enables the simple creation of many kinds of functionality, such as mirroring (gmirror) and encryption ([[GBDE]] and [[Geli (software)|GELI]]). This work was supported through sponsorship by [[DARPA]]. The 5.4 and 5.5 releases of FreeBSD confirmed the FreeBSD 5.x branch as a highly stable and high-performing release, although it had a long development period due to the large feature set. Earlier releases on the 5.x branch are not considered stable enough for production deployment. ===FreeBSD 6=== FreeBSD 6.0 was released on November 4, 2005. The most recent FreeBSD 6 release was 6.4, on November 11, 2008. These versions continue work on SMP and threading optimization along with more work on advanced [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] functionality, TrustedBSD security event auditing, significant network stack performance enhancements, a fully preemptive kernel and support for hardware performance counters (HWPMC). The main accomplishments of these releases include removal of the Giant lock from [[Virtual file system|VFS]], implementation of a better-performing optional libthr library with 1:1 threading and the addition of a Basic Security Module (BSM) audit implementation called [[OpenBSM]], which was created by the TrustedBSD Project (based on the BSM implementation found in Apple's [[open source software|open source]] [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]) and released under a [[BSD licenses|BSD-style license]]. ===FreeBSD 7=== FreeBSD 7.0 was released on 27 February 2008. The most recent FreeBSD 7 release was 7.3, on March 23, 2010. New features include [[SCTP]], [[Unix File System|UFS]] [[Journaling file system|journaling]], an experimental port of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]'s [[ZFS]] file system, [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC4]], improved support for the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[CPU architecture|architecture]], jemalloc (a [[malloc|memory allocator]] optimized for [[parallel computation]],<ref>{{cite web |title=A Scalable Concurrent malloc(3) Implementation for FreeBSD |first=Jason |last=Evans |url=http://people.freebsd.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf |format=PDF |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> which was ported to [[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3]]),<ref name="FreeBSD-7-RELEASE">{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/announce.html|title=FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE Announcement|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> and major updates and optimizations relating to network, audio, and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2008/02/26/whats-new-in-freebsd-70.html?page=1|title=What's New in FreeBSD 7.0|first=Federico|last=Biancuzzi|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher=onlamp.com}}</ref> Benchmarks have shown significant speed improvements over previous FreeBSD releases as well as Linux.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.freebsd.org/~kris/scaling/7.0%20Preview.pdf|title=Introducing FreeBSD 7.0|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> The new
