in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called [[Mark Granovetter#The strength of weak ties|"the strength of weak ties"]]. [[Guanxi]] (关系）is a central concept in Chinese society (and other East Asian cultures) that can be summarized as the use of personal influence. It is loosely analogous to "clout" or "pull" in the West. Guanxi can be studied from a social network approach.<ref>Barry Wellman, Wenhong Chen and Dong Weizhen. “Networking Guanxi." Pp. 221–41 in Social Connections in China: Institutions, Culture and the Changing Nature of Guanxi, edited by Thomas Gold, Douglas Guthrie and David Wank. Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref> The [[small world phenomenon]] is the [[hypothesis]] that the chain of social acquaintances required to connect one arbitrary person to another arbitrary person anywhere in the world is generally short. The concept gave rise to the famous phrase [[six degrees of separation]] after a 1967 ''small world experiment'' by psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]]. In Milgram's experiment, a sample of US individuals were asked to reach a particular target person by passing a message along a chain of acquaintances. The average length of successful chains turned out to be about five intermediaries or six separation steps (the majority of chains in that study actually failed to complete). The methods (and ethics as well) of Milgram's experiment was later questioned by an American scholar, and some further research to replicate Milgram's findings had found that the degrees of connection needed could be higher.<ref>[http://www.judithkleinfeld.com/ar_bigworld.html ''Could It Be A Big World After All?'']: [[Judith Kleinfeld]] article.</ref> Academic researchers continue to explore this phenomenon as Internet-based communication technology has supplemented the phone and postal systems available during the times of Milgram. A recent electronic small world experiment at [[Columbia University]] found that about five to seven degrees of separation are sufficient for connecting any two people through e-mail.<ref>Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, Duncan Watts.</ref> [[Collaboration graph]]s can be used to illustrate good and bad relationships between humans. A positive edge between two nodes denotes a positive relationship (friendship, alliance, dating) and a negative edge between two nodes denotes a negative relationship (hatred, anger). Signed social network graphs can be used to predict the future evolution of the graph. In signed social networks, there is the concept of "balanced" and "unbalanced" cycles. A balanced cycle is defined as a [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] where the product of all the signs are positive. Balanced graphs represent a group of people who are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, but C and A have a negative relationship is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to morph into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concept of balances and unbalanced cycles, the evolution of [[sign]]ed [[social network graph]]s can be predicted. One study has found that [[happiness]] tends to be correlated in social networks. When a person is happy, nearby friends have a 25 percent higher chance of being happy themselves. Furthermore, people at the center of a social network tend to become happier in the future than those at the periphery. Clusters of happy and unhappy people were discerned within the studied networks, with a reach of three degrees of separation: a person's happiness was associated with the level of happiness of their friends' friends' friends.<ref>[[James H. Fowler]] and [[Nicholas A. Christakis]]. 2008.

Existing models of network formation cannot account for this intrinsic node variation, so the researchers propose an alternative "Attract and Introduce" model that can explain heritability and many other features of human social networks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Model of Genetic Variation in Human Social Networks |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1720–1724 |date=10 February 2009 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0806746106 |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/genes_and_social_networks.pdf|format=PDF|author=Fowler, J.
