Its mobile version runs on [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]], while its desktop version runs on [[Mac OS X]] Leopard and Snow Leopard (respectively 10.5 and 10.6). On April 9, 2010, Twitter acquired Tweetie, the mobile version of which was renamed '''Twitter''' (originally to be called 'Twitter for iPhone'<ref name="twitter1">{{cite web|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-iphone.html |title=Twitter Blog: Twitter for iPhone |publisher=Blog.twitter.com |date=2010-04-09 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>) and released on May 17, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8 |title=Twitter for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad on the iTunes App Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> ==Added value== It is one of the few iPhone clients that allow users to manage multiple accounts. Tweetie features a "native" iPhone look and feel, and aims to be lightweight and full-featured. The design has changed a fair bit in the second inception of the iPhone app; however, it retains a high amount of [[usability]]. The vast majority of the Twitter [[REST]] [[API]] is supported in Tweetie, and it also supports the new search API. ==History== Similar applications include [[Seesmic]], [[Twitterrific]] and [[TweetDeck]]. The Mac OS X version of Tweetie has many of the same features as its portable sibling. It has a free ad supported version. The registered version costs $19.95. The beta of the Mac version was leaked to the popular torrent site [[Demonoid]] a week before the official release. Tweetie 2 is currently available for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/atebits_support/status/3408549558|title=Atebits Support reply to user on twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> ==Acquisition by Twitter== On April 9, 2010, Twitter announced through a blog post that the company had acquired Tweetie. Twitter stated that the acquisition stemmed from the lack of an official, Twitter-branded app. The blog post also stated that the app would be rebranded as "Twitter for iPhone" and would be released in the coming weeks. Loren Brichter will be given a position on the Twitter Mobile team and will also assist in launching the "Twitter for iPad" application.<ref name="twitter1"/> On January 6, 2011, Twitter announced through a blog post that the company had also acquired the desktop version of Tweetie, changing the name to "Twitter for Mac". "Twitter for Mac" was launched on the new [[Mac App Store]] the same day. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/11/20/tweetie-10 Review] at [[Daring Fireball]] by [[John Gruber]] *[http://tweetcrunch.com/2008/11/15/tweetie-the-new-twitter-app-for-the-iphone-preview/ Review] at [[tweetcrunch]] *[http://smokingapples.com/iphone/app-store-iphone/review-tweetie-twitter-client/ Review] at [[Smoking Apples]] *[http://www.atebits.com/ Developer's Site] {{Twitter Navigation}} [[Category:2008 software]] [[Category:Blog software]] [[Category:IOS software]] [[Category:Twitter]] [[it:Tweetie]] [[pt:Tweetie]] [[zh:Tweetie]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38442</id> <title>Twelve Olympians</title> <text><!-- Please see talk before modifying list.--> [[Image:Olympians.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Twelve Olympians by [[Nicolas-André Monsiau|Monsiau]], circa late 18th century.]] :''Greek pantheon redirects here''. The '''Twelve Olympians''', also known as the ''Dodekatheon'' ({{lang-el|'''Δωδεκάθεον''' < δώδεκα}},<ref>Used comparatively rarely, in [[Byzantine Greek]], e.g. by [[Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] or [[Doukas (historian)|Ducas]].</ref> dōdeka, "twelve"+ θεοί, theoi, "gods"), in [[Greek mythology]], were the principal [[Greek Gods|god]]s of the Greek [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], residing atop [[Mount Olympus]]. The Twelve Olympians gained their supremacy in the world of gods after Zeus led his siblings to victory in [[Titanomachy|war]] with the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]. [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], [[Hades]], and [[Chiron]] (who was not a god, but a trainer to the children of the gods, also known as [[demigods]]) were siblings. Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, the Charites, Heracles, Dionysus, Hebe, and Persephone were children of Zeus. Some versions of the myths state that Hephaestus was born of Hera alone, and that Aphrodite was born of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]' blood. The first ancient reference of religious ceremonies for them is found in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Hermes. The Greek cult of the Twelve Olympians can be traced to the 6th century BC Athens and probably has no precedent in the Mycenaean period. The altar to the Twelve Olympians at Athens is usually dated to the archonship of the younger [[Pesistratos]], in 522/521 BC. The concept of the "Twelve Gods" is older than any of our Greek or Roman sources, and is likely of Anatolian origin. There seems to have been a great deal of fluidity when it came to who was counted among their number in antiquity.<ref name="Stoll">According to {{Cite book| last=Stoll | first=Heinrich Wilhelm (translated by R.

[[Hades]] (Roman: [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto)]] was not generally included in this list. He did not have a seat in the pantheon because he spent almost all of his time in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]].

The difference in the list is explained{{By whom|date=September 2010}} by the story that when Dionysus was offered a seat among the Olympians, the total number of Olympians became thirteen. Believing this would create a fight amongst the gods, Hestia stepped down.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[Herodotus]] included in his Dodekatheon the following deities: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hermes, Athena, Apollo, [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]], [[Cronus]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and the [[Charites]].<ref name="Pap">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dodekatheon|encyclopedia=Papyros-Larousse-Britanicca|year=2007|language=Greek}}</ref><ref name="Wil">{{Cite book|title=Der Glaube der Hellenen (Volume 1) |last=Wilamowitz-Moellendorff |first=Ulrich von |authorlink=Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff |coauthors= |year=1931–1932 |publisher=Weidmansche Buchhandlung|location=Berlin |language=Deutch|pages=329}}</ref> [[Herodotus]] also includes [[Heracles]] as one of the Twelve.{{Clarify|date=September
