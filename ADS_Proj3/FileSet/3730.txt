The length of time needed to complete the task may be longer or shorter depending on the skill of the person performing the task, so it is in the employer's best interests to find the fastest worker possible. Assume that the cost of another day of interviewing the candidates is $100. If the employer had deduced from the interviews so far that both candidates would complete the task in somewhere between 195 and 205 hours, it would be in the employer's best interests to choose one or the other by some easily-applied metric (for example, flipping a coin) rather than spend the $100 on determining the better candidate, saving at most $100 in labor. In many cases, the decision may be made on the basis of [[heuristic]]; a simple decision model which may not be completely accurate. For example, in deciding which brand of prepared food is most nutritious, a shopper might simply choose the one with (for example) the lowest amount of sugar, rather than conducting a research study of all the positive and negative factors in nutrition. ==Applications== Marketers can take advantage of rational ignorance by increasing the complexity of a decision. If the difference in value between a quality product and a poor product is less than the cost to perform the research necessary to differentiate between them, then it is more rational for a consumer to just take his chances on whichever of the two is more convenient and available. Thus, it is in the interest of the producer of a lower value product to proliferate features, options, and package combinations until the average shopper finds it too much trouble to make an informed decision. This also works for politics. By increasing the number of issues that a person needs to consider in order to make a rational decision between candidates, they can level the playing field by encouraging [[Theory of issue voting|single-issue voting]], party-line voting, and other habits that tend to ignore a candidate's actual qualifications for the job. Another, more nuanced, political application involves a voter's identification with a political party, much like the adoption of a favorite movie critic. Based on prior experience a reasonably responsible voter will find politicians or a political party that will draw conclusions similar to their own conclusions when the voter had the time to do the analysis. ==Criticism== Much of the empirical support for the idea of rational ignorance was drawn from studies of voter [[apathy]], which reached particularly strong conclusions in the 1950s.<ref>Campbell, A., Converse, P., Miller, W. and Stokes. D. (1960), 'The American Voter', Wiley, N.Y.</ref> However, apathy appeared to decline sharply in the 1960s as concern about issues such as the [[Vietnam War]] mounted , and political [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] increased<ref>Nie, N., Verba, S. and Petrocik, J. (1976), 'The Changing American Voter', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass.</ref>. This suggests that voters' interest in political information increases with the importance of political choices. Additionally, rational ignorance is scrutinized for its broadening effect on the decisions that individuals make in different matters. The investment of time and energy on the specified subject has ramifications on other decision areas. Individuals sometimes forget to take this into account when unconsciously assessing the investment cost versus payout. The external benefits are therefore not adequately taken into account. ==See also== {{Portal|Philosophy}} * [[Bounded rationality]] * [[Satisficing]] * [[Categorical imperative]] * [[Rationality and power]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.strom.clemson.edu/teams/ced/econ/8-3No29.pdf The Theory of Rational Ignorance] *[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/ratirnew.doc Rational Ignorance vs. Rational Irrationality] *[http://www.jstor.org/view/00129682/di952648/95p0129t/0 Rational Behavior Under Complete Ignorance] (account needed) *[http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&q=http://bbs.cenet.org.cn/uploadImages/200332715474972903.pdf Rational Irrationality: Some Economics of Self-Management] *[http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.jet.2005.02.005 Would Rational Voters Acquire Costly Information?] *[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00182-006-0051-4 Rational Ignorance and Voting Behavior] {{DEFAULTSORT:Rational Ignorance}} [[Category:Public choice theory]] [[Category:Epistemology]] [[Category:Game theory]] [[fr:Ignorance rationnelle]] [[it:Ignoranza razionale]] [[pl:Racjonalna ignorancja]] [[ru:Рациональное невежество]] [[fi:Rationaalinen ignoranssi]] [[nl:Rationele onwetendheid]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31339</id> <title>Ravindra K.

Ahuja ''' is a world-renowned{{Peacock term|date=May 2010}} researcher and academician. He has contributed to the theory and applications of [[Network theory#Network_optimization|network optimization]] and his research papers are widely cited. Dr. Ahuja publishes widely and is a coauthor of more than 100 research papers and book chapters in the areas of [[Industrial Engineering]], [[Operations Research]], and [[Computer Science]]. He is also a coauthor of three textbooks and an Associate Editor of three prestigious{{Peacock term|date=May 2010}} journals: ''[[Operations Research]], [[Transportation Science]]'', and ''[[Networks (journal)|Networks]]''. ==Biography== Dr. Ahuja holds a joint appointment of Professor in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the [[University of Florida]], Gainesville, and President & CEO of Innovative Scheduling, Inc. He obtained his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Industrial and Management Engineering from the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]]. He has served as a Professor at the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]], [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], and the [[Rutgers Business School]]. Dr. Ahuja founded [http://www.InnovativeScheduling.com Innovative Scheduling Inc.], in 2000 to bring cutting-edge [[Operations Research]] techniques to the field of transportation and scheduling. He has developed innovative models and algorithms for several airline scheduling, railroad scheduling, and logistics problems that were previously considered intractable. These models have now been packaged into interactive web-enabled decision support systems. Innovative Scheduling received seed grants from the NSF ([[National Science Foundation]]) [[SBIR]] Program (Small Business Innovations Research) to build two railroad decision support systems: Railroad Blocking and Train Scheduling. The company began commercializing the systems built through these NSF grants, and invested this revenue to fund the research and development of new decision support systems. The company now has eight decision support systems for various railroad planning and scheduling problems, several of these are
