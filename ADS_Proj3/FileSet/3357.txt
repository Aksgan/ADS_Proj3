hunter [[Lord Cholmondeley]] set his sights on the ultimate trophy, the head of Optimus Prime. In order to lure Optimus in, Cholmondeley captured the Autobots [[Tracks (Transformers)|Tracks]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], [[Grapple (Transformers)|Grapple]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]]. [[Windcharger]] and [[Huffer (Transformers)|Huffer]] were able to avoid being trapped. When [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] learned of the location Cholmondeley was keeping the captured Transformers, Optimus Prime accepted Cholmondeley's challenge to meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons [[Astrotrain]] and [[Blitzwing]]'s attempt to ally the Decepticons with Cholmondeley, Optimus defeated the big game hunter and freed the Autobots. Cholmondeley and the stolen jet were handed over to the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions. Throughout the first two seasons, Optimus Prime has led the Autobots to many victories, like stopping Megatron from controlling the crystal of power ("Fire on the Mountain"), stopping the [[Dinobots]]' rebellion by saving [[Grimlock]] ("War of the Dinobots"), defeated [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]] with his detach arm ("City of Steel"), helped capture [[Nightbird (Transformers)|Nightbird]] ("Enter the Nightbird"), rescued [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] from the Decepticons on the [[Moon]] with the help of [[Omega Supreme]] ("Blaster Blues"), and help saved [[Perceptor]] and the other Transformers from the cosmic rust disease ("Cosmic Rust"). Over the course of the next twenty years, the Decepticons succeeded in seizing control of all of Cybertron, forcing the Autobots to operate from their new city on Earth, and from two bases on Cybertron's moons. In the Earth year 2005 A.D., Prime was stationed on Moonbase One, and dispatched troops to Earth to acquire energy for an upcoming strike on Cybertron. The Decepticons, however, got wind of the plan and used the shuttle run to attack Autobot City; a distress call summoned Prime and support troops to Earth, and in the fearsome ensuing fight with Megatron, Optimus Prime sustained fatal injuries, but not before turning the tide of battle and forcing the Decepticons to flee. Despite the efforts of Perceptor, Optimus Prime went offline. The Matrix, and with it leadership of the Autobots, fell into the hands of [[Ultra Magnus]], [[Galvatron]], and subsequently to [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]]. His last words were "''Until that day... 'till all are one.''" Prime's body was entombed in a massive deep-space mausoleum with the many other fallen Autobots, but his corpse was desecrated by the [[Quintessons]] in 2006, when they reanimated it as part of an attempt to destroy the Autobots by using Prime to lure their space fleet into a trap. However, the Matrix was able to purify Prime of the Quintesson influence, and he ordered the other Autobots to clear out while he piloted his flagship into the Quintessons' detonator, triggering the explosion of a nearby sun. Prime was believed to have been destroyed in the explosion. According to "[[The Return of Optimus Prime]]", Prime's body was recovered from the craft by two human scientists, Jessica Morgan and Gregory Swofford, just minutes before the explosion. However, as their ship departed, it was coated with solar spores released by the explosion of the sun. Jessica's father, Mark Morgan, loathed the Transformers (both Autobot and Decepticon), and his hatred only grew when an attempt by the Decepticons to steal a heat-resistant alloy he had developed resulted in Jessica being paralyzed. Swofford and Morgan reconstructed Optimus Prime's body in an attempt to use it as a delivery system for the spores, which induced [[enmity]] and madness in every sentient being they came into contact with, in order to destroy the Transformers. However, when they could not reanimate him, they used his body as a lure instead, bringing the Autobots to their lab, where they were infected. As this "[[Hate Plague]]" proceeded to spread across the galaxy, [[Sky Lynx]] retrieved a Quintesson, who fully restored Optimus Prime to life. Coating himself in Morgan's heat-resistant alloy, Prime reclaimed the Matrix from Rodimus and unleashed its concentrated wisdom to destroy the Hate Plague. In 2007, Prime began to suffer from visions following the release of the Matrix's energy, which foretold a great transformation for Cybertron. Events began with the Decepticons' theft of the key to the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]], which forced Prime to consult Alpha Trion within [[Vector Sigma]], and Prime learned that the mega-computer had orchestrated events in order to restore Cybertron's Golden Age. When the Plasma Energy Chamber was opened and threatened to drive Earth's Sun supernova, [[Spike Witwicky]] and the [[Nebulon|Nebulans]] who had become involved in the conflict as a result of these events were able to drain off the excess solar energy and revitalize Cybertron. With the Decepticons driven off Cybertron, and Nebulon free from tyranny, Cybertron enters into a Golden Age of peace and prosperity under the leadership of Optimus Prime and the Autobots. The seldom-seen "5th season" re-airing of the show featured the G1 episodes retold by a stop-motion Powermaster Optimus Prime to the live-action youngster Tommy Kennedy. No real back story was ever established for Prime becoming a Powermaster, but the new sequences were said to take place after the four previous seasons, indicating that in the original Sunbow continuity at least, Prime became a Powermaster at some point. Although the animated series ended in the U.S. after ''The Rebirth'', Optimus Prime continued to appear in animated sequences in the Transformers toy commercials, progressing from Powermaster to Action Master, and even appearing as a computer-generated Combat Hero Optimus Prime. Many episodes of the series are re-aired again to promote ''Transformers: Generation 2''. During these sequences, computer-generated scenes featuring key (recolored) G1 characters are borrowed from Generation 2 commercials to serve as an opening, closing, and commercial bumpers. Optimus Prime is shown in the opening and closing fighting Generation 2's [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]]. While the ''Transformers'' animated series came to an end in America with ''The Rebirth'' in 1987, across the [[Pacific]], in Japan, it was decided to continue production of the show with three new, exclusive animated series (spin-offs) to continue the story. The first of these series, ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]'', supplanted the events of ''The Rebirth'',
