to the Asiatic Society in 1786, [[Karl Verner]]'s ''Eine Ausnahme der ersten Lautvershiebung'' in 1875 and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de Linguistique Générale]]'' in 1916.<ref>Hockett 1965:185</ref> But shortly thereafter he became a sharp critic of Chomskyan linguistics. By 1966, Hockett rejected "[Chomsky's] frame of reference in almost every detail".<ref>Hockett 1966: 156</ref> In his 1968 book ''The State of the Art'', Hockett writes that Chomsky's main fallacy is that he treats language as a formal, well-defined, stable system and proceeds from this idealized abstraction. Hockett believes such an idealization is not possible, since there is no empirical evidence that our language faculty is, in reality, a well-defined underlying system. The sources that give rise to language faculty in humans, e.g. physical genetic transmission and cultural transmission, are themselves ill-defined. In Hockett's view, "we must not promote our more or less standardized by-and-large characterization of the language to the status of a monolithic ideal, nor infer that because we can achieve a fixed characterization some such monolithic ideal exists, in the lap of God or in the brain of each individual speaker." <ref>Hockett 1968: 83</ref> Hockett critiques other aspects of Chomskyan theory presented in ''Syntactic Structures'' as well, including syntax's complete autonomy from semantics. British linguist [[Geoffrey Sampson]], who is another long-standing critic of Chomskyan brand of linguistics, maintains that Chomsky's intuition-based, non-empirical view of language presented in ''Syntactic Structures'' came to become the dominant theoretical paradigm in the following years partly because of Chomsky's charisma as an authoritative, trustworthy figure. Sampson notes that there are many references in ''Syntactic Structures'' to Chomsky's own ''LSLT'' in matters regarding the formal underpinnings of Chomsky's approach, but ''LSLT'' was not widely available in print for decades. ''Syntactic Structures'', albeit "sketchy", derived its "aura of respectability" from ''LSLT'' lurking in the background. In turn, the acceptance of Chomsky's future works rested on the success of ''Syntactic Structures''.<ref>Sampson 2001: 152</ref> ==Honor== In 2000, [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Cognitive Sciences compiled a list of the 100 most influential works in [[cognitive science]] from the 20th century. In total, 305 scholarly works and one movie were nominated via the internet. ''Syntactic Structures'' was ranked number one on this list, marking it as the most influential work of the century.<ref>See the list online here: http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/final.html</ref> ==Bibliography== * {{citation |last=Barsky |first=Robert |author= |authorlink= Robert Barsky |title= Noam Chomsky: A life of Dissent |url=http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/ |year=1997 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts }} * {{citation |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |author= |authorlink= Noam Chomsky |title=Syntactic Structures |url=http://www.google.com/books?id=a6a_b-CXYAkC |year=1957 |publisher=Mouton |location=The Hague/Paris }} * {{citation |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |author= |authorlink= Noam Chomsky |title=[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]] |url= |year=1965 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts }} *{{citation |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |author= |authorlink= |chapter= Introduction |title=The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory |url=http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Structure-Linguistic-Theory/dp/030630760X |year=1975 |publisher=Plenum |location=New York }} * {{Citation | last=Cook | first=Vivian | authorlink= | title=Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' fifty years on | journal=International Journal of Applied Linguistics | volume=17 | issue=1 | year=2007 | pages=120–131 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118505208/abstract | doi=10.1111/j.1473-4192.2007.00137.x }} * {{Citation | doi = 10.1590/S0102-44501997000300007 | last = Dillinger | first =Mike | last2 =Palacio | first2 =Adair | chapter=Lingüística gerativa: Desenvolvimento e Perspectivas uma Entrevista com Noam Chomsky | pages= 199–235 | year=1997 | title=DELTA: Documentação de Estudos em Lingüística Teórica e Aplicada | volume=13 | issue = No. Especial São Paulo | journal = DELTA: Documentação de Estudos em Lingüística Teórica e Aplicada | publisher= | publication-date= | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-44501997000300007&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=pt }} {{pt icon}} * {{Citation | last = Hockett | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Hockett | coauthors = | title = Sound Change | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/411873 | journal = Language | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–204 | year = 1965 | doi =10.2307/411873 | postscript = . }} * {{Citation | last = Hockett | first =Charles | editor = | chapter= Language, mathematics and linguistics | pages= 155–304 | year=1966 | title=Current Trends in Linguistics | volume= 3.
