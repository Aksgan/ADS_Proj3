Note fill port in center.]] A '''fill device''' is an electronic module used to load [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] into electronic [[encryption]] machines. Fill devices are usually hand held and battery operated. Older mechanical encryption systems, such as [[rotor machine]]s, were keyed by setting the positions of wheels and plugs from a printed keying list. Electronic systems required some way to load the necessary cryptovariable data. In the 1950s and 1960s, systems such as the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Security Agency]] [[KW-26]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Fialka]] used [[punched card]]s for this purpose. Later [[NSA encryption systems]] incorporated a [[serial port]] fill connector and developed several '''common fill devices''' (CFDs) that could be used with multiple systems. A CFD was plugged in when new keys were to be loaded. Newer [[National Security Agency|NSA]] systems allow "[[Over the Air Rekeying|over the air rekeying]]" (OTAR), but a master key often must still be loaded using a fill device. NSA uses two serial protocols for key fill, '''DS-101''' and '''DS-102'''. Both employ the same [[U-229]] 6-pin connector type used for U.S. military audio [[handset]]s, with the DS-101 being the newer of the two serial fill protocols. The DS-101 protocol can also be used to load cryptographic algorithms and software updates for crypto modules. Besides encryption devices, systems that can require key fill include [[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF]], [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[frequency hopping]] radios such as [[Have Quick]] and [[SINCGARS]]. Common fill devices employed by NSA include: *[[AN/CYZ-10]] Data Transfer Device - a small [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like unit that can store up to 1000 keys. *[[Secure DTD2000 System]] (SDS) - Nomenclatured KIK-20 is the next generation common fill device replacement for the DTD. *[[AN/PYQ-10]] Simple Key Loader (SKL) - a simpler replacement for the DTD. *[[KOI-18]] [[paper tape]] reader. The operator pulled 8-level tape through this unit by hand. *[[KSD-64]] Crypto ignition key (CIK) *[[KYK-13]] Electronic Transfer Device *KYX-15 Net Control Device *MX-10579 ECCM Fill Device ([[SINCGARS]]) Only the KSD-64, CYZ-10, Secure DTD2000, PYQ-10 and KOI-18 can handle modern 128-bit keys. Older units are apparently limited to 90-bit keys. A newer fill device, the [[Secure DTD2000 System]] (or SDS), which employs the [[Windows CE]] operating system, began production in 2006.[http://www.sypriselectronics.com/electronics/content.asp?page_id=34] ==See also== *[[List of cryptographic key types]] ==External links== *[http://www.pacificsites.com/~brooke/CryptoM.shtml#FHw Fill devices] *[http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/kyx15.html KYX-15 pictures] [[Category:Key management]] [[Category:Encryption device accessories]] [[Category:National Security Agency encryption devices]] {{crypto-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>13559</id> <title>Filmation engine</title> <text>[[Image:Knight lore 3.gif|thumb|300px|''[[Knight Lore]]'', Ultimate Play The Game's first title to utilise the Filmation engine]] '''Filmation''' is the [[trademark]] name of the [[Isometric projection|isometric]] graphics engine employed in a series of games developed by [[Ultimate Play The Game]] during the [[1980s#Video games|1980s]], primarily on the [[8-bit]] [[ZX Spectrum]] platform, but various titles also appeared on the [[BBC Micro]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]] and [[Commodore 64]] platforms. The Filmation engine allowed the creation of [[forced perspective]] 3D [[flip-screen]] environments, ideally suited to [[platform game|platform-based]] [[arcade adventure]]s. [[Player character#Computer and video games|Player characters]] could move in four diagonal (from the player's perspective) directions, were able to jump over or onto obstacles, and even push objects around the game environment. == Precursors == [[Image:3d ant attack 1.gif|thumb|Sandy White's ''[[Ant Attack]]'' used a similar isometric style to Ultimate's Filmation and Filmation II titles]] At least three games had used an isometric perspective before Filmation's first appearance in 1984; the arcade games ''[[Q*bert]]'' and ''[[Zaxxon]]'' (both 1982) from [[Gottlieb]] and [[Sega]] respectively, and the [[ZX Spectrum]] title ''[[Ant Attack]]'' (1983) by [[Sandy White]]. ''Q*bert'' and ''Zaxxon'' have little else in common with Filmation, though ''Ant Attack'' was a [[platform game]] of similar style, and was the first of these games to feature an extra [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degree of freedom]] (the ability to move up and down as well and north, south, east and west). It was claimed by White that ''Ant Attack'' was "the first true isometric 3D game".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sandywhite.co.uk/fun/ants | title=Sandy White - an Ant Attack homepage | accessdate=2006-03-28}}</ref> == Development == When Filmation was introduced a year later, it featured far more complex graphics and environments than any isometric title yet, garnering ''[[Knight Lore]]'' much attention and critical acclaim. Ultimate Play The Game first described the engine in the ''Knight Lore'' manual thus: {{cquote2|KNIGHT LORE features filmation [''sic''] © a unique process whereby you have complete freedom within the confines of your imagination, to do as you wish with any of the objects found within KNIGHT LORE|Ultimate Play The Game|''Knight Lore'' documentation<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ultimate-wurlde.com/games/knightloreinstr.shtml | title=''Knight Lore'' documentation | accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref>}} ''Knight Lore'' was followed six months later by ''[[Alien 8]]'' and in 1986 by ''[[Pentagram (video game)|Pentagram]]''. A second engine, '''Filmation II''', was introduced in 1985 and used in two titles, ''[[Nightshade (video game)|Nightshade]]'' and ''[[Gunfright]]''. This new version of the engine introduced large [[scrolling]] environments (much like ''Ant Attack''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s) rather than flip-screens. To avoid obscuring the player character, streets and buildings rendered by this engine would disappear to their outlines when the player character walked behind them, and the ability to flip the viewpoint through 180 degrees with a press of the Z key was introduced. Although Filmation II increased the graphical complexity of the titles that used it, the gameplay was simplified; the player was no longer able to jump (and indeed had no reason to) and was confined to essentially simpler environments, with no obstacles other than the buildings themselves. This simplification resulted in ''Nightshade'' and ''Gunfright'' being more straightforward [[shooter game]]s than the puzzle based Filmation I titles. Two later games, ''[[Martianoids]]'' and ''[[Bubbler (video game)|Bubbler]]'', were developed by [[U.S. Gold]] (and published on the Ultimate Play The Game label) which also used scrolling 3D environments, though neither made explicit use of the Filmation II engine. Both had similarities to Filmation II, though ''Martianoids'' did not use a true isometric perspective
