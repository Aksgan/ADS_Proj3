[[Image:Datacenter Backup Batteries.jpg|thumb|right|A bank of batteries in a large data center, used to provide power until diesel generators can start.]] ===Environmental control=== {{main|Data center environmental control}} The physical environment of a data center is rigorously controlled. [[Air conditioning]] is used to control the temperature and humidity in the data center. [[ASHRAE]]'s "Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tc99.ashraetcs.org/documents/ASHRAE_Extended_Environmental_Envelope_Final_Aug_1_2008.pdf|format=PDF|title=ASHRAE's "Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments"}}</ref> recommends a temperature range of {{convert|16|–|24|C|F}} and humidity range of 40–55% with a maximum dew point of 15°C as optimal for data center conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serverscheck.com/blog/2008/07/why-monitor-humidity-in-computer-rooms.html|title=ServersCheck's Blog on Why Humidity Monitoring|date=July 1, 2008}}</ref> The temperature in a data center will naturally rise because the electrical power used heats the air. Unless the heat is removed, the ambient temperature will rise, resulting in electronic equipment malfunction. By controlling the air temperature, the server components at the board level are kept within the manufacturer's specified temperature/humidity range. Air conditioning systems help control [[humidity]] by cooling the return space air below the [[dew point]]. Too much humidity, and water may begin to [[condensation|condense]] on internal components. In case of a dry atmosphere, ancillary humidification systems may add water vapor if the humidity is too low, which can result in [[electrostatics|static electricity]] discharge problems which may damage components. Subterranean data centers may keep computer equipment cool while expending less energy than conventional designs. Modern data centers try to use economizer cooling, where they use outside air to keep the data center cool.<ref>Detailed expanation of economizer-based cooing{{cite web|url=http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Economizer%20Fundamentals%20-%20Smart%20Approaches%20to%20Energy-Efficient%20Free-Cooling%20for%20Data%20Centers.pdf|format=PDF|title=Economizer Fundamentals: Smart Approaches to Energy-Efficient Free-Cooling for Data Centers}}</ref> Washington state now has a few data centers that cool all of the servers using outside air 11 months out of the year. They do not use chillers/air conditioners, which creates potential energy savings in the millions.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS141369+14-Sep-2009+PRN20090914 | work=Reuters | title=tw telecom and NYSERDA Announce Co-location Expansion | date=2009-09-14}}</ref> Telcordia [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&DOCUMENT=GR-2930& GR-2930, ''NEBS: Raised Floor Generic Requirements for Network and Data Centers''], presents generic engineering requirements for raised floors that fall within the strict NEBS guidelines. There are many types of commercially available floors that offer a wide range of structural strength and loading capabilities, depending on component construction and the materials used. The general types of raised floors include stringerless, stringered, and structural platforms, all of which are discussed in detail in GR-2930 and summarized below. *'''''Stringerless Raised Floors''''' - One non-earthquake type of raised floor generally consists of an array of pedestals that provide the necessary height for routing cables and also serve to support each corner of the floor panels. With this type of floor, there may or may not be provisioning to mechanically fasten the floor panels to the pedestals. This stringerless type of system (having no mechanical attachments between the pedestal heads) provides maximum accessibility to the space under the floor. However, stringerless floors are significantly weaker than stringered raised floors in supporting lateral loads and are not recommended. *'''''Stringered Raised Floors''''' - This type of raised floor generally consists of a vertical array of steel pedestal assemblies (each assembly is made up of a steel base plate, tubular upright, and a head) uniformly spaced on two-foot centers and mechanically fastened to the concrete floor. The steel pedestal head has a stud that is inserted into the pedestal upright and the overall height is adjustable with a leveling nut on the welded stud of the pedestal head. *'''''Structural Platforms''''' - One type of structural platform consists of members constructed of steel angles or channels that are welded or bolted together to form an integrated platform for supporting equipment. This design permits equipment to be fastened directly to the platform without the need for toggle bars or supplemental bracing. Structural platforms may or may not contain panels or stringers. ===Electrical power=== Backup power consists of one or more [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]] and/or [[Electrical generator|diesel generator]]s.<ref>Detailed expanation of UPS topologies {{cite web|url=http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Evaluating%20the%20Economic%20Impact%20of%20UPS%20Technology.pdf|format=PDF|title=EVALUATING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF UPS TECHNOLOGY}}</ref> To prevent [[single point of failure|single points of failure]], all elements of the electrical systems, including backup systems, are typically fully duplicated, and critical servers are connected to both the "A-side" and "B-side" power feeds. This arrangement is often made to achieve [[N+1 Redundancy]] in the systems. Static switches are sometimes used to ensure instantaneous switchover from one supply to the other in the event of a power failure. Data centers typically have [[raised floor]]ing made up of {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on|0}} removable square tiles. The trend is towards {{convert|80|-|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} void to cater for better and uniform air distribution. These provide a [[plenum]] for air to circulate below the floor, as part of the air conditioning system, as well as providing space for power cabling. ===Low-voltage cable routing=== Data cabling is typically routed through overhead [[cable tray]]s in modern data centers. But some are still recommending under raised floor cabling for security reasons and to consider the addition of cooling systems above the racks in case this enhancement is necessary. Smaller/less expensive data centers without raised flooring may use anti-static tiles for a flooring surface. Computer cabinets are often organized into a [[hot aisle]] arrangement to maximize airflow efficiency. ===Fire protection=== Data centers feature [[fire protection]] systems, including [[passive fire protection|passive]] and [[active fire protection|active]] design elements, as well as implementation of [[fire prevention]] programs in operations. [[Smoke detectors]] are usually installed to provide early warning of a developing fire by detecting particles generated by smoldering components prior to the development of flame. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual fire suppression using hand held fire extinguishers before the fire grows to a large size. A [[fire sprinkler system]] is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. Fire
