If properly done, this precludes undesired third-parties from forcing a key choice on the agreeing parties. Protocols that are useful in practice also do not reveal to any eavesdropping party what key has been agreed upon. ==Exponential key exchange== The first publicly-known<ref>See [[Diffie-Hellman]] for a more complete history of both the secret and public development of public-key cryptography. </ref> public-key agreement protocol that meets the above criteria was the [[Diffie-Hellman]] exponential key exchange, in which two parties jointly [[Exponentiation|exponentiate]] a generator with random numbers, in such a way that an eavesdropper has no way of guessing what the key is. However, exponential key exchange in and of itself does not specify any prior agreement or subsequent authentication between the participants. It has thus been described as an anonymous key agreement protocol. ==Authentication== Anonymous key exchange, like Diffie-Hellman, does not provide authentication of the parties, and is thus vulnerable to [[Man-in-the-middle]] attacks. A wide variety of cryptographic authentication schemes and protocols have been developed to provide authenticated key agreement to prevent man-in-the-middle and related attacks. These methods generally mathematically bind the agreed key to other agreed-upon data, such as the following: * Public/private key pairs * Shared secret keys * Passwords ===Public keys=== A widely-used mechanism for defeating such attacks is the use of [[digital signature|digitally signed]] keys that must be integrity-assured: if Bob's key is signed by a [[trusted third party]] vouching for his identity, Alice can have considerable confidence that a signed key she receives is not an attempt to intercept by Eve. When Alice and Bob have a public-key infrastructure, they may digitally sign an agreed Diffie-Hellman agreed key, or exchanged Diffie-Hellman public keys. Such signed keys, sometimes signed by a [[certificate authority]], are one of the primary mechanisms used for secure [[web traffic]] (including [[HTTPS]], [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] or [[Transport Layer Security]] protocols). Other specific examples are [[MQV]], [[YAK (cryptography) | YAK]] and the [[Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol|ISAKMP]] component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications. However, these systems require care in endorsing the match between identity information and public keys by certificate authorities in order to work properly. ===Hybrid systems=== Hybrid systems use public-key cryptography to exchange secret keys, which are then used in a symmetric-key cryptography systems. Most practical applications of cryptography use a combination of cryptographic functions to implement an overall system that provides all of the four desirable features of secure communications (Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Non-repudiation). ===Passwords=== [[Password-authenticated key agreement]] protocols require the separate
