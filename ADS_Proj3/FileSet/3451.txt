He is also the former Head of the [[UNSW School of Computer Science and Engineering]]. He is known for proposing [[Ripple Down Rules]]. ==Career== Paul Compton worked at the Garvin Institute before his appointment at UNSW. He became the Head of School from 1996–1998, and again from 2003-2010. He was very popular as Head of School, and upon his retirement a large gathering fare-welled him, as well as creating a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz2Lp_5aGwk&feature=digest YouTube] slide-show tribute. ==Research== Paul Compton along with R.
