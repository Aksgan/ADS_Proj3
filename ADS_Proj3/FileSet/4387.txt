However, as good as automatic test design can be, it is not appropriate for all circumstances. If the complexity becomes too high, then human test design must come into play as it is far more flexible and it can concentrate on generating higher level test suites. == References == <references/> [[Category:Software testing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37116</id> <title>Test for structural change</title> <text>'''Test for structural change''' is an [[econometrics|econometric]] test.

The game was released in Japan on October 14, 2008, in North America on October 20, 2008,<ref>[http://www.wiiware-world.com/news/2008/10/usa_wiiware_update_tetris_party_and_the_incredible_maze USA WiiWare Update: Tetris Party & The Incredible Maze]</ref> and in Europe and Australia on October 24, 2008.<ref>[http://www.wiiware-world.com/news/2008/10/eu_wiiware_update_tetris_party_the_incredible_maze_and_home_sweet_home EU WiiWare Update: Tetris Party, The Incredible Maze and Home Sweet Home]</ref> A retail version called ''Tetris Party Deluxe'', which was announced by Tetris Online, [[Hudson Soft]], [[Nintendo Australia]] and [[Majesco]], was released in North America on June 1st, 2010, in Europe on September 3rd, 2010 and in Australia on October 14th, 2010 for the [[Wii]] and the [[Nintendo DS]] systems.<ref>[http://wii.nintendolife.com/news/2010/02/tetris_party_deluxe_dropping_into_wii_and_ds Tetris Party Deluxe Dropping Into Wii and DS]</ref> There is also a version from the [[DSiWare]] called ''Tetris Party Live'', which was released in North America on November 22, 2010 and later in the PAL region on December 3, 2010. ==Game modes== ''Tetris Party'' introduces a number of new game modes. In addition to the 15-level traditional single player only marathon mode, the single and multiplayer versus modes, and Vs. Hot Lines and Team Battle modes returning from earlier games,<ref name=ignhands>[http://wii.ign.com/articles/916/916625p1.html IGN: Tetris Party Hands-on]</ref> these new modes include:<ref name=ignblog>[http://wii.ign.com/articles/915/915956p1.html Live Blog: Nintendo Fall Media Summit: Day 2]</ref> * '''Beginner's Tetris''': The traditional 15-level game with larger blocks, a smaller play field and new [[Tetromino|Tetrimino]]s such as a three-block line, a two-block line and a small three-block L-shape. * '''Wii Balance Board Tetris''': A variation of Beginner's Tetris in which players control falling Tetriminos using the Balance Board, leaning left and right to move the Tetrimino, leaning forward or backward to drop it, and squatting to rotate it in a clockwise direction. This game type also includes a 3-minute high-score mode called "Balance Ultra" and a Vs. Computer battle mode. * '''Co-op Tetris''': Two players work together simultaneously on a double size play field to clear lines. * '''Field Climber''': The player builds layers of blocks to help a tiny man reach the top of the screen. The mode is time-based, and also available in online versus play. * '''Shadow''': Players must race to fill in a background image with Tetriminos, while not allowing any pieces to lie outside of the puzzle in the process. This mode features new Tetrimino shapes, and a total of 30 puzzles.<ref name=ignhands/> * '''Stage Racer''': The player guides a single Tetrimino downward through a narrow twisting passage, being sure not to get it caught on the sides. * '''Dual Spaces''': A [[Reversi]]-inspired mode where players section off empty space, and gain points for every empty space they lock out by placing their Tetriminos to create larger areas of their own color. The multiplayer versus modes support up to four players offline and six players online through the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], and feature new powerups that utilize the pointer and motion functions of the [[Wii Remote]]. The game also keeps skill charts and statistics, and features online leaderboards and more than 130 achievements for players to monitor their progress.<ref name=ign2>[http://wii.ign.com/articles/921/921279p1.html IGN: Tetris Party Hands-on 2]</ref> The game does not include any multiplayer marathon modes. Garbage is not optional in multiplayer mode as it was in ''[[The New Tetris]]''. ===Tournament play=== Both Hudson and Tetris Online have organized tournaments for players of the game, with the first held in December 2008. Each tournament involves the different game modes in ''Tetris Party'', with the first and third tournaments featuring four rounds with four different game modes contested in each.<ref>[http://tetrisparty.com/en_US/tournament Hudson Soft Tournament]</ref><ref>[http://www.wiiware-world.com/news/2008/11/more_tetris_party_tournament_details More Tetris Party Tournament Details]</ref> There was a total of four tournaments where the top 500 in the first and third tournaments and top 100 in the second and fourth tournaments would be credited with 1,200 Nintendo points to use for either the Wii Shop or DSiWare Shop. ==Reception== [[IGN]] scored the game a 9/10, calling it "the best console version [of ''Tetris''] we've seen in years" and a "must buy", though they were slightly disappointed in the somewhat limited online multiplayer.<ref>[http://wii.ign.com/articles/921/921717p1.html IGN: Tetris Party Review]</ref> WiiWare World gave it 8/10, praising the online play in general and calling it "the most robust online ''Tetris'' experience money can buy" next to ''[[Tetris DS]]'', though they were also disappointed in the limited online play modes and felt the game is geared more towards local multiplayer than for solo players.<ref>[http://www.wiiware-world.com/reviews/2008/10/tetris_party WiiWare World Tetris Party Review]</ref>. The [[Official Nintendo Magazine]] gave the game 91%. They were very impressed by
