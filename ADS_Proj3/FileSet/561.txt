[[UNESCO]]. It was first released in 1985 and since then over 20,000 [[license|licences]] have been issued by UNESCO and a worldwide network of distributors. It is particularly suited to bibliographical applications and is used for the [[library catalog|catalogues]] of many small and medium-sized [[library|libraries]]. Versions have been produced in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish amongst other languages. UNESCO makes the software available free for non-commercial purposes, though distributors are allowed to charge for their expenses. CDS/ISIS is an acronym which stands for Computerised Documentation Service / Integrated Set of Information Systems. In 2003 it was stated that "This package is accepted by libraries in the developing countries as a standard software for information system development". <ref> National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka. "CDS ISIS Library Software" [Last Update 10th January 2003.] http://www.nsf.ac.lk/slstic/isis.htm Accessed June 20, 2007.</ref> The original CDS/ISIS ran on an [[IBM]] [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] and was designed in the mid 1970s under Mr Giampaolo Del Bigio for UNESCO's Computerized Documentation System (CDS). It was based on the internal ISIS (Integrated Set of Information Systems) at the [[International Labour Organization]] in Geneva. In 1985 a version was produced for mini- and microcomputers programmed in Pascal. It ran on an [[IBM PC]] under [[MS-DOS]]<ref>Buxton, Andrew and Hopkinson, Alan. ''The CDS/ISIS handbook''. London: Library Association, 1994</ref> . ''Winisis'', the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version, first demonstrated in 1995, may run on a single [[computer]] or in a [[local area network]]. The ''JavaISIS'' client/server components allow remote [[database management system|database management]] over the [[Internet]] and are available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. Furthermore, ''GenISIS'' allows the user to produce [[HTML]] Web forms for CDS/ISIS database searching. The ''ISIS_DLL'' provides an [[API]] for developing CDS/ISIS based applications. [[OpenIsis]] library provides another [[API]] for developing CDS/ISIS based applications with some improvements. == See also == * [[IDAMS]] - Statistical Software * [[IDIS]] is a tool for direct data exchange between CDS/ISIS and IDAMS. * [[OpenIsis]] the opensource alternative for CDS/ISIS. == External links == * [http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=2071&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html CDS/ISIS database software (UNESCO)] * [https://listserv.surfnet.nl/archives/cds-isis.html Archives of CDS-ISIS@NIC.SURFNET.NL] * http://openisis.org/ * http://sourceforge.net/projects/isis * [http://pecl.php.net/package/isis PHP extension for reading CDS/ISIS databases] * [http://projectkenai.com/projects/j-isis/pages/Home J-ISIS New UNESCO Java CDS/ISIS Software] == References == {{Reflist}} {{database-software-stub}} [[Category:Knowledge representation]] [[Category:Proprietary database management systems]] [[de:CDS/ISIS]] [[id:CDS/ISIS]] [[it:CDS/ISIS]] [[uk:CDS/ISIS]] [[es:CDS/ISIS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4994</id> <title>CDXL</title> <text>'''CDXL''' is an obsolete motion video [[file format]] developed by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the [[Amiga]] computer platform. It is notable for being one of the earliest formats created for motion video playback from [[CD-ROM]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sassenrath.com/carl.html|title=Former Commodore Engineer, Carl Sassenrath's home page}}</ref>. ==Background== In an era shortly after the introduction of CD-ROM drives and before low cost [[MPEG]] decoding hardware became available the CDXL format was created primarily for the [[Amiga CDTV]] to permit playback of video from CD-ROM. CDXL was tailored for the [[Amiga Original chipset|Amiga chipset]] and took advantage of [[Direct memory access|DMA]] transfers and relied little on the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5293606.html|title=Free Patents Online}}</ref>. As a result CDXL could only support weak [[video compression]] and therefore relatively low video resolutions and moderate [[frame rate]]s. The CDXL format initially allowed playback of up to 24 frames per second with up to 4096 colors encoded in [[Hold And Modify#HAM6 operation|HAM-6]]. Audio support allowed for 8-bit mono or stereo sound. When the [[Amiga CD32]] was released the format was able to support [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] color modes (up to 262,144 on-screen colors from a 24-bit color palette) and higher display resolutions. Designed as a streaming format CDXL consists of linear concatenated chunks (packets), each with an uncompressed frame and associated audio data. There is no overall file header, just the header of each chunk. The FPS rate is constant but not stored in the file, so it is necessary to set the playback speed in the player software manually. CDXL is not related to [[ANIM]] file format (a subset of [[Interchange File Format]]) It is supported by [[AmigaOS]] through '''CDXL.datatype''' which allows playback of CDXL files on compatible Amiga computers through standard universal, datatype-loader based, multimedia tool of AmigaOS called [[Amiga_support_and_maintenance_software#MultiView|Multiview]]. ==Usage== A number of Amiga CD-ROM games and entertainment software from the era used CDXL for motion video. ==Performance== Playback was moderately impressive at the time of release given the CDTV's [[Motorola 68000]] processor, [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] chipset and single-speed CD-ROM drive. A single-speed (150 [[KiloByte|kB]]/s) CD-ROM drive permitted resolutions equivalent to 160×100 with 4,096 colors at 12 [[Frame rate|FPS]] with 11025 Hz 8-bit mono audio. At these settings audio and visual quality would be perceived as considerably worse than [[VHS]]. A CDXL stream at 300 kB/s (equivalent to 256×128 at 12 FPS) allows approximately 36 minutes of video to fit on CD-ROM. In comparison, a [[Video CD]] encoded in [[MPEG-1]] format allows approximately 72 minutes of 384×280 24-bit color video at 25 FPS [http://ninjaw.ifrance.com/cd32/_docs/cdxl/cdxl.html]. ==External links== *[http://www.a500.org/downloads/video/cdxlplay-sdl_zip.readme CDXL player software] == References == <references/> {{AmigaOS}} {{Compression Formats}} {{Media player (application software)}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Cdxl}} [[Category:Graphics file formats]] [[Category:Amiga]] [[Category:Computer and telecommunication standards]] [[Category:Computer file formats]] [[Category:Container formats]] [[Category:Film and video technology]] [[ru:CDXL]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4996</id> <title>CD Player (Windows)</title> <text>{{Infobox Windows component | name = CD Player | logo = CDPlayer Icon.png | screenshot = CD_Player_in_Windows.png | caption = CD Player running in Windows Vista with no disc inserted | type = [[Media player (application software)|Media Player]] | included_with = [[Windows 98]]<br />[[Windows NT 3.51]]<br />[[Windows NT 4.0]]<br />[[Windows 2000]] (as Deluxe CD Player) | also_available_for = [[Windows 95]]<br />[[Windows Me]]<br />[[Windows XP]]<br />[[Windows Vista]]<br />[[Windows 7]] | replaces = | replaced_by = [[Windows Media Player]] | related_components = [[DVD Player (Windows)|DVD Player]]<br />[[Media Player (Microsoft)|Media Player]] | support_status = Discontinued }} '''CD Player''' is a [[computer program]] that plays audio [[CD]]s using the computer's [[sound card]]. It was included in [[Windows 98]], [[Windows NT 3.51]], [[Windows NT 4.0]] and [[Windows 2000]]. CD Player can be downloaded separately for other versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] as well. It has been removed from modern versions of Windows, starting with [[Windows Me]]. ==Features==
