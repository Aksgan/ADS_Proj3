first where operators had direct control over programs running in real-time. These had started in 1944 with the famed [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] which was originally developed to make a [[flight simulator]] for the [[US Navy]], although this was never completed.<ref>[http://www.mitre.org/news/releases/09/whirlwind_07_01_2009.html "MITRE's Project Whirlwind Computer Collection Transferred to MIT"], MITRE, 1 July 2009</ref> Instead, this effort evolved into the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system for the [[US Air Force]], which used large screens and [[light gun]]s to allow operators to interact with [[radar]] data stored in the computer.<ref>[http://www.mitre.org/about/sage.html "Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE)"], MITRE, 25 January 2005</ref> When the Air Force project wound down, the Lab turned their attention to an effort to build a version of the Whirlwind using [[transistor]]s in place of [[vacuum tube]]s. In order to test their new circuitry, they first built a small [[18-bit]] machine known as [[TX-0]] which first ran in 1956.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/XD154.75 "TX-0 Computer"], Computer History Museum</ref> When the TX-0 successfully proved the basic concepts, attention turned to a much larger system, the [[36-bit word length|36-bit]] [[TX-2]] with a then-enormous 64 kWords of [[core memory]]. Core was so expensive that parts of TX-0's memory were stripped for the TX-2, and what remained of the TX-0 was then given to [[MIT]] on permanent loan.<ref name=cm>[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/TheCompMusRep/TCMR-V08.html Highlights from ''The Computer Museum Report'' Volume 8 Spring 1984], [[The Computer Museum]], Boston, MA, archived at ed-thelen.org, retrieved 2010-2-19</ref> At MIT, Olsen and Anderson noticed something odd: students would line up for hours to get a turn to use the stripped-down TX-0, while largely ignoring a faster [[IBM]] machine that was also available. The two decided that the draw of interactive computing was so strong that they felt there was a market for a small machine dedicated to this role, essentially a commercialized TX-0. They could sell this to users where graphical output or realtime operation would be more important than outright performance. Additionally, as the machine would cost much less than the larger systems then available, it would also be able to serve users that needed a lower-cost solution dedicated to a specific task, where a larger 36-bit machine wouldn't be needed.<ref name=companyhistory/> In 1957 when the pair and Ken's brother Stan went looking for capital, they found that the American business community was hostile to investing in computer companies. Many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the 1950s, wiped out when new technical developments rendered their platforms obsolete, and even large companies like [[RCA]] and [[General Electric]] were failing to make a profit in the market. The only serious expression of interest came from [[Georges Doriot]] and his [[American Research and Development Corporation]] (AR&D). Worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing, Doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers, and even change their name from "Digital Computer Corporation".<ref name=companyhistory/> The pair returned with an updated [[business plan]] that outlined two-phases for the company's development. They would start by selling [[computer module]]s as stand-alone devices that could be purchased separately and wired together to produce a number of different digital systems for lab use. Then, if these "digital modules" were able to build a self-sustaining business, the company would be free to use them to develop a complete computer in their Phase II.<ref name=proposal>[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/dec/pdp-1/DEC.pdp_1.1957.102664472.pdf "A Proposal to American Research and Development Corporation 27 May 1957"]</ref> The newly christened DEC received $70,000 from AR&D for a 70% share of the company,<ref name=companyhistory/> and began operations in a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era textile mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]], where plenty of inexpensive manufacturing space was available. ===Digital modules=== [[Image:Dec SYSTEM BUILDING BLOCKS 1103.jpg|thumb|System Building Blocks 1103 hex-inverter card (both sides)]] In early 1958 DEC shipped its first products, the "Digital Laboratory Module" line. The Modules consisted of a number of individual electronic components and [[Bipolar_junction_transistor#Germanium_transistors|germanium transistors]] mounted to a [[circuit board]], the actual circuits being based on those from the TX-2.<ref name=modules>Richard Best, Russell Doane and John McNamara, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/computer_engineering/00000125.htm"Digital Modules, The Basis for Computers"], ''Computer Engineering, A DEC view of hardware systems design", Digital Press, 1978</ref> The Laboratory Module were packaged in an extruded aluminum housing,<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102633142 "DEC Laboratory Module â€“ FLIP-FLOP 201"], Computer History Museum</ref> intended to sit on an engineer's workbench. They were then connected together using [[4 mm plug|banana plug]] [[patch cord]]s inserted at the front of the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5 MHz (1957), 500 kHz (1959), or 10 MHz (1960).<ref name=modules>Richard Best, Russell Doane and John McNamara, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/computer_engineering/00000125.htm"Digital Modules, The Basis for Computers"], in ''Computer Engineering, A DEC view of hardware systems design", Digital Press, 1978</ref> The Modules proved to be in high demand in other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone, turning a profit at the end of its first year.<ref name=companyhistory/> The original Laboratory Modules were soon supplemented with the "Digital Systems Module" line, which were identical internally but packaged differently. The Systems Modules were designed with all of the connections at the back of the module using 22-pin Amphenol connectors, and were attached to each other by inserting them into a custom [[19-inch rack]]. These versions allowed 25 modules be to inserted into a single 5-1/4 inch section of racking, and allowed the high densities needed to build a computer.<ref name=modules/> DEC used the Systems Modules to build their "Memory Test" machine for testing core memory systems, selling about 50 of these pre-packaged units over the next eight years.<ref name=present3>''Present'' 1978, pg. 3</ref> Modules were part of DEC's product line into the 1970s, although they went through several evolutions during this time as technology changed. The same circuits were then packaged as the first "R" (red) series "[[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip-Chip]]" modules. Later, other module series provided additional speed, much higher logic density, and industrial I/O capabilities.<ref name=present10/> Digital published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular. ===PDP-1 family===
