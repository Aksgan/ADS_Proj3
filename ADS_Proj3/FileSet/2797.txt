leave Endurance crater, visit its discarded heat shield, and proceed to [[Victoria (crater)|Victoria crater]]. ''Spirit'' was to attempt to climb to the top of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]]. With the two rovers still functioning well, NASA later announced another 18 month extension of the mission to September 2006. ''Opportunity'' was to visit the "Etched Terrain" and ''Spirit'' was to climb a rocky slope toward the top of [[Husband Hill]]. On August 21, 2005, ''Spirit'' reached the summit of Husband Hill after 581 [[Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols|sols]] and a journey of 4.81 kilometers (2.99 mi). [[Image:Sol582A P2299 L456-A590R1 br.jpg|thumb|left|''Spirit'''s "postcard" view from the summit of Husband Hill: a windswept plateau strewn with rocks, small exposures of outcrop, and sand dunes. The view is to the north, looking down upon the "Tennessee Valley".

''Opportunity'' celebrated its anniversary on December 12, 2005. At the beginning of the mission, it was expected that the rovers would not survive much longer than 90 Martian days. The Columbia Hills were "just a dream", according to rover driver Chris Leger. ''Spirit'' explored the semicircular rock formation known as [[Home Plate (Mars)|Home Plate]]. It is a layered rock outcrop that puzzles and excites scientists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} It is thought that its rocks are explosive volcanic deposits, though other possibilities exist, including impact deposits or sediment borne by wind or water. ''Spirit'''s front right wheel ceased working on March 13, 2006, while the rover was moving itself to [[McCool Hill]]. Its drivers attempted to drag the dead wheel behind Spirit, but this only worked until reaching an impassable sandy area on the lower slopes. Drivers directed ''Spirit'' to a smaller sloped feature, dubbed "Low Ridge Haven", where it spent the long Martian winter, waiting for spring and increased solar power levels suitable for driving. That September, ''Opportunity'' reached the rim of Victoria crater, and Spaceflight Now reported that NASA had extended mission for the two rovers through September 2007.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20060927.html | title = NASA Mars Rover Arrives at Dramatic Vista on Red Planet | publisher =nasa.gov | accessdate = 2006-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0609/26rovers/ | title = Mars rover, Global Surveyor, Odyssey missions extended | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-09-27}}</ref> On February 6, 2007, ''Opportunity'' became the first spacecraft to traverse ten kilometers (10,000 meters) on the surface of Mars.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/images/opp-20070207.html | title = Opportunity Passes 10-Kilometer Mark | publisher =nasa.gov | accessdate = 2007-02-08}}</ref> ''Opportunity'' was poised to enter Victoria Crater from its perch on the rim of Duck Bay on June 28, 2007,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070628a.html | title = NASA Mars Rover Ready For Descent Into Crater | publisher = jpl.nasa.gov | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}</ref> but due to extensive dust storms, it was indefinitely delayed until the dust had cleared and power returned to safe levels.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_opportunityAll.html#sol1220 | title = Opportunity Waiting for Dust to Settle | publisher = jpl.nasa.gov | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}</ref> Two months later, ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' resumed driving after hunkering down during raging dust storms that limited solar power to a level that nearly caused the permanent failure of both rovers.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070824.html | title = Mars Exploration Rover Status Report: Rovers Resume Driving | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2007-08-30}}</ref> On October 1, 2007,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol1337 | title = Hardy Rover Continues to Celebrate Milestones | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2007-10-16}}</ref> both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' entered their fifth mission extension that could possibly extend operations into 2009,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/071015-marsrover-extendedmission.html | title = NASA Extends Mars Rover Mission a Fifth Time | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2007-10-16}}</ref> allowing the rovers to have spent five years exploring the Martian surface, pending their continued survival. On August 26, 2008, ''Opportunity'' began its three-day climb out of Victoria crater amidst concerns that power spikes, similar to those seen on ''Spirit'' before the failure of its right-front wheel, might prevent it from ever being able to leave the crater if a wheel failed. Project scientist Bruce Banerdt also said, "We've done everything we entered Victoria Crater to do and more." ''Opportunity'' will return to the plains in order to characterize Meridiani Planum's vast diversity of rocks&mdash;some of which may have been blasted out of craters such as Victoria.
