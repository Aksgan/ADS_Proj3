It has influenced later subset languages, such as ADsafe and [[Caja project|Caja/Cajita]], subsets of Javascript. It is also notable for allowing methods to be verified as [[pure function|functionally pure]], based on their method signatures.<ref>[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/pure-ccs08.pdf Verifiable Functional Purity in Java], Matthew Finifter, Adrian Mettler, Naveen Sastry, David Wagner; October 2008, Conference on Computer and Communications Security.</ref> The restrictions imposed by the Joe-E verifier include: * Classes may not have mutable static fields, because these create global state. * Catching out-of-memory exceptions is prohibited, because doing so allows non-deterministic execution. For the same reason, <tt>finally</tt> clauses are not allowed. * Methods in the standard library may be blocked if they are deemed unsafe according to taming rules. For example, the constructor <tt>new File(filename)</tt> is blocked because it allows unrestricted access to the filesystem. [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cup_of_joe Cup of Joe] is slang for coffee, and so serves as a trademark-avoiding reference to Java. Thus, the name Joe-E is intended to suggest an adaptation of ideas from the [[E (programming language)|E programming language]] to create a variant of the Java language.

The name by which he is more commonly known is derived from his native town of [[Trittenheim]] on the [[Mosel]] in [[Germany]]. ==Life== He studied at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Travelling from university to his home town in 1482, he was surprised by a [[snowstorm]] and took refuge in the [[Benedictine]] abbey of [[Sponheim]] near the [[Bad Kreuznach]]. He decided to stay and was elected [[abbot]] in 1483, at the age of twenty-one. He set out to transform the abbey from a neglected and undisciplined place into a centre of learning. In his time, the abbey [[library]] increased from around fifty items to more than two thousand. However, his efforts did not meet with praise, and his reputation as a [[magic and religion|magician]] did not further his acceptance. Increasing differences with the [[convent]] led to his [[resignation]] in 1506, when he decided to take up the offer of the [[Bishop of Würzburg]], [[Lorenz von Bibra]] (bishop from 1495 to 1519), to become the abbot of [[St. James's Abbey, Würzburg]], the ''[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Schottenkloster]]'' in Würzburg. He remained there until the end of his life. Trithemius was buried at the Schottenkirche St. Jakob with a tombstone by the famous [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]. In 1825 the tombstone was moved to the Neumünster church, next to the cathedral. In 1945 it was damaged in the firebombing and subsequently restored by the workshop of Theodor Spiegel. Among his pupils were [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486-1535) and [[Paracelsus]] (1493-1541). == Steganographia ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Goetia]] --> Trithemius' most famous work is ''Steganographia'' (written ''c.''1499; published [[Frankfurt]], 1606, placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in 1609<ref>{{cite book |title = Indice de Libros Prohibidos (1877) |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Yq8XAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA309&dq=index+librorum+prohibitorum+trithemius&lr=&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |language = Spanish |trans_title = Index of Prohibited Books of Pope Pius IX (1877) |accessdate = 2 August 2009 |publisher = Vatican}}</ref>, removed in 1900<ref>{{cite book |title = Index Librorum Prohibitorum (1900) |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=pM0XAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA298&dq=index+librorum+prohibitorum+tricassinus&lr=&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |page = 298 |language = Latin |trans_title = Index of Prohibited Books of Pope Leo XIII (1900) |accessdate = 2 August 2009 |publisher = Vatican}}</ref>). This book is in three volumes, and appears to be about [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] - specifically, about using [[spiritual being|spirit]]s to communicate over long distances. Since the publication of the decryption [[key (cryptography)|key]] to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with [[cryptography]] and [[steganography]]. Until recently, the third volume was widely still believed to be about magic, but the "magical" formulae have now been shown to be [[stegotext|covertext]]s for yet more cryptography content.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3926/is_/ai_n8820687 | work=Cryptologia | title=Solved: The ciphers in book III of Trithemius's Steganographia | first=Jim | last=Reeds | year=1998}}</ref> The work has lent its name to the modern field of steganography.
