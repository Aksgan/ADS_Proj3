presentation technology for use on other platforms. Dave's ability to switch-hit hardware and software was useful; Scala planned a hardware project, but not initially. He designed Scala's "Class Definition Language" and compiler, some high level tools for the operating system Scala was defining for portable multimedia. But the hardware projects never came around.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1995, Haynie did some consulting, along with [[Andy Finkel]], for [[Amiga Technologies]], the company resulting from [[Escom]]'s acquisition of the Commodore assets. He and Finkel defined a next generation Amiga platform, based on a $500 PowerPC platform and a whole new version of AmigaOS. However, ESCOM's own financial problems killed this before it went very far.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ==The set-top revolution== [[File:Metabox1000.jpg|thumb|Metabox 1000]] The [[Amiga Technologies]] experience, however, wasn't for naught. Some of the managers liked what they saw in Haynie and Finkel. In June 1996 he joined managers [[Stefan Domeyer]] and [[Geerd Ebeling]] a German startup company initially called [[PIOS Computer]], later renamed to [[Metabox]]. Metabox was initially selling [[Apple Macintosh]] [[Clone (computer science)|clones]] and attempting to sell Amiga follow-on systems based on the [[PowerPC]] processor. An attempt to get a license to [[AmigaOS]] failed. Instead the company sold [[BeOS]] to [[Apple Macintosh]] [[Clone (computer science)|clones]] and [[BeBox]] to the German market. Thanks to a lucky hire of [[Thomas Rudloff]], an Amiga/Macintosh CPU board wizard, Metabox shipped the first commercial Macintosh-compatible system to run at 300 MHz.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} After [[Steve Jobs]] shut down Macintosh compatibles, Metabox went in a different direction: the advanced [[set-top box]]. The first effort, the [[Metabox 100]], simply enabled users to cheaply access Metabox's [[Internet service provider|ISP]] serviceâ€”kind of a German [[WebTV]]. The follow up [[Metabox 500]] was one of the first [[multimedia]] STB's around, adding video and high quality audio.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The big plan, however, was for the [[Metabox 1000]], a ground up new design in hardware and software. This system used a smallish 90 MHz [[Coldfire]] as the main processor, but allowed all kinds of modular upgrades: for video, for DTV, for encryption. It tuned analog TV, [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], played [[DVD]], [[MP3]], accessed network resources, did fully functional Web browsing and email, etc. In short, one of the first multi-function STBs. The home grown system design was enhanced by an AmigaOS-like [[operating system]] designed by [[Andy Finkel]] and [[Carsten Schlote]]. This system won much praise from Metabox's targets (large cable and satellite companies), but the company started failing. This was due to both the bad financial climate of 2000-2001, rumors of fraud and other monkey business, and German local law which was forcing the company to stop paying the development team (many consultants and non-Germans), while they kept the local people (at their peak, Metabox employed about 260 people). Haynie was quoted as saying, at their peak, his shares were worth about US$5.6million (sales were locked out from the IPO); but by the time he left the company, they owed him US$75,000, which was never repaid.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://landley.net/history/mirror/commodore/haynie.html | title=Dave Haynie - October 01, 2003 (archived) | author=Amiga.org | date=1 October 2003 | accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> ==Fortele== After Metabox, Haynie did a number of [[Consultant|consulting]] gigs. Some paid well, some didn't pay, and none of it was terribly exciting. In 2002 he got back together with [[Andy Finkel]] and two other ex-[[Commodore International|Commodore]] people, [[Robert Russell]]{{dn}} and Neil Harris, to form [[Fortele]], Inc. The plan here was whole house media networking. Their approach was to make every audio/video appliance just a node on the network, make the system know the user and learn his habits, etc. But despite the technology working well, the business part failed even before the [[dog and pony show]] had been finished.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ==Robots and radios== After Fortele, Haynie started working for Nomadio, Inc. Nomadio, Inc. is founded by [[Bhana Grover]] and [[Alex Gizis]], both veterans of 1990s [[Internet]] startups. Haynie was initially hired on to work on a full [[robot]] project. However, Nomadio decided it was better to create a radio platform that would control radio control cars or cost effective robots. Nomadio had released the first all-digital controller for high performance [[Radio control|radio-controlled]] cars. At the same time Nomadio began producing hardened version of digital controller for military robots.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}Dave Haynie was instrumental in producing the Nomadio GC-205 , the radio controller that is used to operate the Bombot and other robots. Dave Haynie has also an engineering and multimedia company called [[Frog Pond Media]], which has served to indulge his love of digital audio and video studio work, and fill in the gaps between startup companies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [[:de:Metabox|Wikipedia DE on Metabox]] * [http://obligement.free.fr/articles/itwhaynie_3.php Long interview with Dave Haynie (Not in english)] * [http://www.vahanus.net/~csc/wiki/index.php/Projects Carsten Schlote's homepage with details on the Metabox 1000 OS 'CaOS'] ([http://www.microkernel.mine.nu/~csc/projects.html Old Link]) * [http://web.archive.org/web/20071024031740/http://amigaguiden.info/davehaynie.html Interview (in Norwegian) with Dave Haynie] (''archive version'') * [http://www.frogpondmedia.com/index.html Frog Pond Media] * [http://www.frogpondmedia.com/dbv Deathbed Vigil DVD] * [http://www.nomadio.net Nomadio, Inc.] * [http://www.thule.no/haynie/ The Dave Haynie Archives] * [http://worldcat.org/isbn/0973864907 "On the Edge: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore"] ISBN 0-9738649-0-7 {{DEFAULTSORT:Haynie, Dave}} [[Category:Computer programmers]] [[Category:Amiga people]] [[Category:Living people]] [[de:Dave Haynie]] [[sv:Dave Haynie]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9529</id> <title>David A.

Thomas took undergraduate (1969) and graduate (1976) degrees at the [[Carleton University]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]], [[Canada]], and held a number of software development positions in the ensuing years. Thomas is perhaps best known as the founder and past CEO of [[Object Technology International]], Inc., now IBM OTI Labs. OTI was responsible for initial development of the [[Eclipse (computing)|Eclipse]] [[open source]] [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]] and the [[VisualAge|Visual Age Java]] development environment.
