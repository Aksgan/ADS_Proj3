two points (one each north and south of the equator) where that condition would be true. As a practical matter, one would not get an exact position, especially with 1950s electronics, even if one knew the satellite's exact orbit, and the exact time --> The first satellite navigation system, [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]], used by the [[United States Navy]], was first successfully tested in 1960. It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour. In 1967, the U.S. Navy developed the [[Timation]] satellite that proved the ability to place accurate clocks in space, a technology required by GPS. In the 1970s, the ground-based [[Omega Navigation System]], based on phase comparison of signal transmission from pairs of stations,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jerry Proc |url=http://www.jproc.ca/hyperbolic/omega.html |title=Omega |publisher=Jproc.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> became the first worldwide radio navigation system. Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy. While there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those were seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation for a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the US Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the US Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with the US Air Force's strategic bombers and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplier]]. Precise navigation would enable US submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions prior to launching their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate= 2007-10-18 |title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS? |publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd |date= |accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref> The US Air Force with two-thirds of the nuclear triad also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem. To increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation. In 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (Mobile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D [[LORAN]]. A follow-on study called Project 57 was worked in 1963 and it was "in this study that the GPS concept was born." That same year the concept was pursued as Project 621B, which had "many of the attributes that you now see in GPS"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html |title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation |publisher=The Aerospace Corporation |date= |accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs. Updates from the Navy Transit system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation. The Navy Research Laboratory continued advancements with their Timation (Time Navigation) satellites, first launched in 1967, and with the third one in 1974 carrying the first atomic clock into orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://support.radioshack.com/support_tutorials/gps/gps_tmline.htm |title=A Guide To The Global Positioning System (GPS) - GPS Timeline |publisher=Radio Shack |date= |accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref> <!-- Another important predecessor to GPS came from a different branch of the US military. In 1964, the [[US Army]] orbited its first SECOR ([[Sequential Collation of Range]]) satellite used for geodetic surveying. The SECOR system included three ground-based transmitters from known locations that would send signals to the satellite transponder in orbit. A fourth ground-based station at an undetermined position could then use those signals to fix its location precisely. The last SECOR satellite was launched in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.astronautix.com/craft/secor.htm |title=SECOR Chronology |work=Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica |date= |accessdate=2010-1-19}}</ref> Decades later during the early years of GPS, civilian surveying became one of the first fields to make use of the new technology, because they could reap benefits of signals from the less-than-complete GPS constellation years before it was declared operational. GPS can be thought of as an evolution of the SECOR system where the ground-based transmitters have been migrated into orbit. --> With these parallel developments in the 1960s, it was realized that a superior system could be developed by synthesizing the best technologies from 621B, Transit, Timation, and SECOR in a multi-service program. During Labor Day weekend in 1973, a meeting of about 12 military officers at the Pentagon discussed the creation of a ''Defense Navigation Satellite System (DNSS)''. It was at this meeting that "the real synthesis that became GPS was created." Later that year, the DNSS program was named ''Navstar''. With the individual satellites being associated with the name Navstar (as with the predecessors Transit and Timation), a more fully encompassing name was used to identify the constellation of Navstar satellites, ''Navstar-GPS'', which was later shortened simply to GPS.<ref> {{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/?id=mB9W3H90KDUC |title=The Precision Revolution: GPS and the Future of Aerial Warfare |author=Michael Russell Rip, James M.
