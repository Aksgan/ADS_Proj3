with [[BSD/386]] which was developed by [[Berkeley Software Design|BSDi]], a Berkeley spinout, starting in 1991. BSD/386 used the same 386BSD code contributed to the University of California on ''4.3BSD NET/2''. Although Jolitz worked briefly for [[UUNET]] (which later spun out BSDi) in 1991, the work he did for them diverged from that contributed to the University of California and did not appear in 386BSD. Instead, William Jolitz gave regular code updates to Donn Seeley of BSDi for packaging and testing, and returned all materials when William Jolitz left that company following fundamental disagreements on company direction and goals. ==Copyright and use of the code== All rights with respect to 386BSD and JOLIX are now held exclusively by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz. 386BSD public releases ended in 1997 since code is now available from the many 386BSD-derived [[operating system]]s today, along with several derivatives thereof (such as [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] and [[OpenBSD]]). Portions of 386BSD may be found in other open systems such as [[OpenSolaris]]. 386BSD is available for research (non-commercial) purposes. ==References== {{No footnotes|date=July 2009}} {{Portal|Free software}} <references/> ==Further reading== * Jolitz, William F. and Jolitz, Lynne Greer: Porting UNIX to the 386: A Practical Approach, 18-part series in Dr. Dobbs Journal, January 1991 - July 1992. * Jolitz, William F. and Jolitz, Lynne Greer: Operating System Source Code Secrets Vol 1 The Basic Kernel, 1996, ISBN 1-57398-026-9 * Jolitz, William F. and Jolitz, Lynne Greer: Operating System Source Code Secrets Vol 2 Virtual Memory, 2000, ISBN 1-57398-027-7 ==External links== * [http://www.386bsd.org www.386bsd.org : Information by William and Lynne Jolitz] * [http://porting-unix-to-the-386.jolix.com/ Porting UNIX to the 386: A Practical Approach] * [http://porting-unix-to-the-386.jolix.com/designing-the-software-specification Designing the Software Specification] * [http://porting-unix-to-the-386.jolix.com/three-initial-pc-utilities Three Initial PC Utilities] * [http://william.telemuse.net William Jolitz] * [http://lynne.telemuse.net Lynne Jolitz] * [http://jolitz.telemuse.net/2lgj/on386bsd Memories of 386BSD releases by Lynne Jolitz] * [http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/05/17/386bsd/index.html The unknown hackers - Salon.com] * [http://minutepitch.valux.com/386bsddesign 386BSD Design Notes Professional Video Series] * [http://www.386bsd.org/faq Frequently asked questions of 386BSD - active Q/A by authors] * [http://www.jolix.com www.jolix.com] * [http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/bsdisuit.html Remarks and papers on USL v UC Berkeley by Dennis M.

It was released to the public on October 17, 2000 for [[United States dollar|USD]]499 as the first (and only) device in the company's "Ergo" initiative to hit the market.<ref>{{cite web | title=3Com lets Audrey out the door | work=News.com | url= | accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref> Once connected to an appropriate provider, users could access the [[internet]], send and receive [[e-mail]], play audio and video, and synchronize with up to two [[Palm OS]]-based devices. ''Audrey'' was the brainchild of Don Fotsch (formerly of Apple Computer and U.S. Robotics) and Ray Winninger. Don and Ray had a vision for a family of appliances, each designed for a specific room in the house. The brand ''Ergo'' was meant to convey that intent, as in "it's in the kitchen, ''[[ergo]]'' it's designed that way"<ref name="ReferenceA">Direct Knowledge - I was there at the time that it was said. - Rob Hudson</ref>. There were plans to serve other rooms in the house as well. They considered the kitchen to be the heart of the home and the control room for the home manager. Don coined the phrase "Internet Snacking" to describe the lightweight web browsing done in this environment<ref name="ReferenceA"/>. The name ''Audrey'' was given to this first product to honor [[Audrey Hepburn]]. It was meant to deliver the elegance that she exuded. The project codename was "[[Kojak]]", named after the [[Telly Savalas]] character. The follow-on product targeted for the family room was code named "[[Mannix]]". 3Com discontinued the product on June 1, 2001, in the wake of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot.com crash]], after only seven and a half months on the market. 3Com customers received full refunds for the product and accessories. The remaining Audrey hardware was liquidated and embraced by the [[hardware hacker]] community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Audrey's life cut short|work=News.com|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1040-254497.html|accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref> ==Hardware== The Audrey is a [[touchscreen]], passive matrix LCD device and came equipped with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]]. All applications were touch-enabled. Since the standard [[infrared]] keyboard was only needed for typing tasks, it could be hung out of the way on the rear of the unit. The stylus was to be placed in a receptacle on the top of the screen with an [[light-emitting diode|LED]] that flashed when email arrived. Buttons on the right side of the screen were used to access the web browser, email application, and calendar, and a wheel knob at the bottom selected different "channels" of [[push technology|push]] content. The 3Com Audrey is powered by a 200 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] GX 1 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], with 16 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[flash ROM]] and 32 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. It measures 9 x 11.8 x 3.0 inches (22.86 x 29.97 x 7.62 cm), and weighs 4.1 pounds (1.86 kg). It is powered by the [[QNX]] [[operating system]]. The Audrey is equipped with a [[modem]], two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, and a [[CompactFlash]] socket. A USB [[Ethernet]] adapter was commonly used for [[broadband]] subscribers. The Audrey was also available in such shades as "linen" (off-white), "meadow" (green), "ocean" (blue), "slate" (grey), and "sunshine" (light yellow). ==Hacking== After the demise of official support, the Audrey drew the attention of computer enthusiasts. They quickly discovered an [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] to
