It has also been used to study to what extent people with different preferences can cooperate (see [[Battle of the sexes (game theory)|Battle of the sexes]]), and whether they will take risks to achieve a cooperative outcome (see [[Stag hunt]]). It has been used to study the adoption of [[technical standard]]s, and also the occurrence of [[bank run]]s and [[currency crises]] (see [[Coordination game]]). Other applications include traffic flow (see [[Wardrop's principle]]), how to organize auctions (see [[Auction theory]]), and even penalty kicks in [[soccer]] (see [[Matching pennies]]).<ref>P.

''American Economic Review'' 92, pp. 1138-51.</ref> ==History== A version of the Nash equilibrium concept was first used by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in his theory of oligopoly (1838). In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A [[Cournot equilibrium]] occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a [[pure strategy]] Nash Equilibrium. The modern game-theoretic concept of Nash Equilibrium is instead defined in terms of [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]], where players choose a probability distribution over possible actions. The concept of the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium was introduced by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in their 1944 book ''The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior''. However, their analysis was restricted to the special case of [[zero-sum]] games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions. The contribution of [[John Forbes Nash]] in his 1951 article ''Non-Cooperative Games'' was to define a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed strategy) Nash Equilibrium must exist in such a game. Since the development of the Nash equilibrium concept, game theorists have discovered that it makes misleading predictions (or fails to make a unique prediction) in certain circumstances. Therefore they have proposed many related [[solution concept]]s (also called 'refinements' of Nash equilibrium) designed to overcome perceived flaws in the Nash concept. One particularly important issue is that some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not '[[credibility|credible]]'. Therefore, in 1965 [[Reinhard Selten]] proposed [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on [[non-credible threats]]. Other extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept have addressed what happens if a game is [[Repeated game|repeated]], or what happens if a game is played in the [[Global game|absence of perfect information]]. However, subsequent refinements and extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept share the main insight on which Nash's concept rests: all equilibrium concepts analyze what choices will be made when each player takes into account the decision-making of others. ==Definitions== ===Informal definition=== Informally, a set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing his or her strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks himself or herself: "Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?" If any player would answer "Yes", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a [[best response]] to all other strategies in that equilibrium.<ref name="preliminaries"> {{cite web | last = von Ahn | first = Luis | title = Preliminaries of Game Theory | url=http://www.scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture08.pdf | accessdate = 2008-11-07 }}</ref> The Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because it may happen that a Nash equilibrium is not [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto optimal]]. The Nash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in sequential games because players may "threaten" each other with non-rational moves. For such games the [[Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium]] may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis. === Formal definition === Let ''(S, f)'' be a game with ''n'' players, where ''S<sub>i</sub>'' is the strategy set for player ''i'', ''S=S<sub>1</sub> X S<sub>2</sub> ... X S<sub>n</sub>'' is the set of [[Strategy (game theory)|strategy profile]]s and ''f=(f<sub>1</sub>(x), ..., f<sub>n</sub>(x))'' is the payoff function. Let ''<math>x_{-i}</math>'' be a strategy profile of all players except for player ''i''. When each player ''i'' <math>\in</math> <nowiki>{1, ..., n}</nowiki> chooses strategy ''x<sub>i</sub>'' resulting in strategy profile ''x = (x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>)'' then player ''i'' obtains payoff ''f<sub>i</sub>(x)''. Note that the payoff depends on the strategy profile chosen, i.e. on the strategy chosen by player ''i'' as well as the strategies chosen by all the other players. A strategy profile ''x<sup>*</sup>'' <math>\in</math> ''S'' is a Nash equilibrium (NE) if no unilateral deviation in strategy by any single player is profitable for that player, that is :<math>\forall i,x_i\in S_i, x_i \neq x^*_{i} : f_i(x^*_{i}, x^*_{-i}) \geq f_i(x_{i},x^*_{-i}).</math> A game can have either a [[pure strategy|pure-strategy]] or a [[mixed strategy|mixed]] Nash Equilibrium, (in the latter a pure strategy is chosen [[stochastic]]ally with a fixed [[frequentist|frequency]]). Nash proved that if we allow [[strategy (game theory)#Pure and mixed strategies|mixed strategies]], then every game with a finite number of players in which each player can choose from finitely many pure strategies has at least one Nash equilibrium. When the inequality above holds strictly (with <math>></math> instead of <math>\geq</math>) for all players and all feasible alternative strategies, then the equilibrium is classified as a '''strict Nash equilibrium'''. If instead, for some player, there is exact equality between <math>x^*_i</math> and some other strategy in the set <math>S</math>, then the equilibrium is classified as a '''weak Nash equilibrium'''.
