for the same reason.) Gold Hill Lisp was too unstable, and its weak architecture made it impossible for Gold Hill to eliminate the bugs. This was a crucial failure for Macsyma. It meant that Macsyma could not respond on PCs when Mathematica appeared on Apple computers in mid-1988. Macsyma appeared on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PCs in August 1989 using the CLOE Lisp from Symbolics. However, the Macsyma staff was too small and lacked the mix of skills needed to add the kind of graphics, notebook interface and better numerics that [[Mathematica]] had. By 1989, it was clear to Petti that Symbolics would implode due to poor product strategy, and that it would take Macsyma with it. (Some product issues: (1) Symbolics' software was designed for MIT-class software developers without enough concessions to others. (2) Symbolics' world-class software was losing share in the market due to dependence on very high-cost hardware. (3) In moving to [[VLSI]] hardware in the mid-1980s, Symbolics converted from 36-bit [[word size]] to a 40-bit, without justification from the market for the enormous development cost of this change.) Macsyma could not assemble a buy-out team due to lack of cooperation from MIT. After keeping reasonably quiet since 1986 about the product issues, Petti tried in late 1988 to persuade Symbolics to adopt a software-only or board-level strategy; but the fourth president in four years would hear nothing of it. In 1990 Petti left Symbolics for a start-up. ===Macsyma, Inc.=== Macsyma, Inc., was founded in 1992 by [[Russell Noftsker]] (chairman, who had co-founded [[Symbolics]]) and Richard Petti (president, who had turned around Macsyma for a time at Symbolics) by raising funds and purchasing the rights to Macsyma from the ailing Symbolics. Although the market was growing fast, Macsyma sales in 1991 and early 1992 were still falling rapidly. Macsyma's market share in symbolic math software had fallen from 70% in 1987 to 1% in 1992. By 1993, market growth had slowed and the market had standardized on [[Mathematica]] and Maple. The competitors had development staffs that were 4-8 times as large as that of Macsyma Inc. throughout the 1990s. In early 1995 the company shipped Macsyma 2.0.5, with many improvements: On Wester's large test of symbolic math, Macsyma 2.0.5 scored 10% better than Maple and 15% better than Mathematica<ref>[http://www.math.unm.edu/~wester/cas_review.html Wester's 1995 review and 1999 review]</ref>. Although Macsyma 2.0.5 was still very slow at numerics, it had a greatly strengthened portfolio of numerical analysis and linear algebra routines. (In 1996 Macsyma added [[LAPACK]] which greatly increased the speed of most numerical linear algebra.) . The development team, at this time, included Jeff Golden (language, compiler, etc), Bill Gosper (special functions, summation), [[Howard Cannon (technologist)|Howard Cannon]] (user interface, optimization), and consultant Bill Dubuque (integration, equation solving, database, optimization). Other developers made major contributions in numerical analysis, graphics, and help systems. The company could not continue indefinitely to outperform staffs 4-8 times as large and reverse the market momentum. Market share did not increase above 2%, because the competitors were entrenched in all key accounts, converting to a new product is very costly in learning time, and market growth declined. Also, starting in 1992 or 1993, [[Mathsoft]] engaged in a [[Pyrrhic_victory | Pyrrhic]] strategy of spending $10 million on direct mail at very low prices, which won much of the remaining growth in the symbolic math market, just when Macsyma Inc. was struggling to rebuild its world-class product. In 1999, Macsyma were acquired by [[Tenedos LLC]], a holding company that previously had purchased Symbolics. The holding company has not re-released or resold Macsyma, but Macsyma continues to be distributed by Symbolics. After a sojourn separately, Petti and Cannon teamed up again in 2007 to form [[ModelSheet|ModelSheet Software LLC]], aimed at a different market. ==Available versions== There is also a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]-licensed version, called [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]], based on the 1982 version of the DOE Macsyma, subsequently adapted for Common Lisp and enhanced by [[William Schelter]]. It is under active development, and can be compiled under several [[Common Lisp]] systems. Downloadable executables for [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and other systems, including [[graphical user interface]]s are available. Maxima does not include many of the numerous features added during the period of commercial development between 1982-1999, but is a current, free, open codebase that includes numerous additional features, several alternative front ends, and works with a number of Common Lisp engines. While this has resulted in some incompatibilities between Macsyma and Maxima, programs written in the Macsyma algebraic language can often be run, with only minor changes, in either system. ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2003/005861.html Richard Petti's summary of the history of commercial Macsyma] ''(remarks on the history of Macsyma by a cofounder of Macsyma, Inc.)'' * [http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2003/005884.html] more from Richard Petti.'' * [http://www.symbolics-dks.com/Macsyma-1.htm Symbolics Macsyma] {{Computer algebra systems}} [[Category:Computer algebra systems]] [[Category:Discontinued software]] [[Category:Lisp software]] [[Category:Common Lisp software]] [[de:Macsyma]] [[pl:Macsyma]] [[pt:Macsyma]] [[ru:Macsyma]] [[fi:Macsyma]] [[tr:Macsyma]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23212</id> <title>Mad in America</title> <text>{{ infobox Book | name = Mad in America | title_orig = Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill | translator = | image = [[File:Mad-in-America-cover.jpg|200px|alt=Black cover with white letters: MAD IN AMERICA, with a new preface and afterword by the author, BAD SCIENCE, BAD MEDICINE, AND THE ENDURING MISTREATMENT OF THE MENTALLY ILL, Robert Whitaker.
