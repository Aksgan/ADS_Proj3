basis for much or most of human communication in practical, day-to-day settings. == Structure == In the UNL approach, information conveyed by natural language is represented, sentence by sentence, as a hypergraph composed of a set of directed binary labeled links (referred to as '''relations''') between nodes or hypernodes (the '''Universal Words''', or simply '''UW'''), which stand for concepts. UWs can also be annotated with '''attributes''' representing context information. As a matter of example, the English sentence ‘The sky was blue?!’ can be represented in UNL as follows: [[File:UNLGraph.svg]] In the example above, "sky(icl>natural world)" and "blue(icl>color)", which represent individual concepts, are UWs; "aoj" (= attribute of an object) is a directed binary semantic relation linking the two UWs; and "@def", "@interrogative", "@past", "@exclamation" and "@entry" are attributes modifying UWs. UWs are supposed to represent universal concepts which are expressed in English words or in any other natural language in order to be humanly-readable. They consist of a "headword" (the UW root) and a "constraint list" (the UW suffix between parentheses), the latter being used to disambiguate the general concept conveyed by the former. The set of UWs is organized in an ontology-like structure (the so-called "UW System"), where upper concepts are used to disambiguate the lower ones through "icl" (= is a kind of), "iof" (= is an instance of) and "equ" (= is equal to) relations. Relations are expected to represent semantic links between words in every existing language. They can be ontological (such as "icl" and "iof" referred to above), logical (such as "and" and "or") and thematic (such as "agt" = agent, "ins" = instrument, "tim" = time, "plc" = place, etc). There are currently 46 relations in the UNL Specs, and they define the syntax of UNL. Attributes represent information that cannot be conveyed by UWs and relations. Normally, they represent information on tense (".@past", "@future", etc), reference ("@def", "@indef", etc), modality ("@can", "@must", etc), focus ("@topic", "@focus", etc), and so on. Under the UNL Program, the process of representing natural language sentences in UNL graphs is called '''enconverting''', and the process of generating natural language sentences out of UNL graphs is called '''deconverting'''. The former, which involves natural language analysis and understanding, is supposed to be carried out semi-automatically (i.e., in a computer-aided human basis); the latter is expected to be done fully-automatically. == UNL Society == * [http://www.undl.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=64 UNL Centre (Tokyo)] * [http://www.undl.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=65 UNL in Armenia] * [http://www.undl.org.br UNL in Brazil] * [http://www.bibalex.org/unl UNL in Egypt] * UNL in France * [http://www.iai.uni-sb.de/iaien/en/unl.htm UNL in Germany] * [http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/ UNL in India] * [http://www.undl.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=65 UNL in Indonesia] * [http://unl.ilc.pi.cnr.it/ UNL in Italy] * [http://www.undl.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=64 UNL in Japan] * [http://www.unl.rss.gov.jo/ UNL in Jordan] * [http://www.ailab.lv/unl.htm UNL in Latvia] * [http://www.unl.ru/ UNL in Russia], [http://proling.iitp.ru/deco/ UNL Russian Deconverter] * [http://www.vai.dia.fi.upm.es/ing/projects/unl/index.htm UNL in Spain] * [http://www.links.nectec.or.th/unl/UnuWeb/UNLP_Homepage.htm UNL in Thailand] == External links == * [http://www.unlweb.net UNLWEB] The UNL Community Portal * [http://www.undlfoundation.org/ UNDL Foundation] where UNL development is coordinated. * [http://www.undl.org/unlsys/unl/unl2005/ UNL Specs] * [http://www.cicling.org/2005/UNL-book Online book on UNL] * [http://www.unl.ru/system.html UNL system description] [[Category:Knowledge representation languages]] [[Category:Computational linguistics]] [[Category:Machine translation]] [[Category:Translation]] [[de:Universal Networking Language]] [[es:Universal Networking Language]] [[eo:UNL]] [[fr:Interlangue]] [[th:Universal Networking Language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38919</id> <title>Universal gateway</title> <text>A '''universal gateway''' is a device that transacts data between two or more data sources using communication protocols specific to each. Sometimes called a universal protocol gateway, this class of product is designed as a computer appliance, and is used to connect data from one automation system to another. == Typical applications include == '''M2M Communications''' – [[Machine to Machine]] Communications between machines from different vendors, typically using different communication protocols. This is often a requirement to optimize the performance of a [[production line]], by effectively communicating machine states upstream and downstream of a piece of equipment. Machine idle times can trigger lower power operation. Inventory Levels can be more effectively managed on a per station basis, by knowing the upstream and downstream demands. '''M2E Communications''' – Machine to Enterprise Communications is typically managed through database interactions. In this case, [[Eatm|EATM]] technology is typically leveraged for data interoperability. However, many enterprise systems have real-time data interfaces. When real-time interfaces are involved, a Universal Gateway, with its ability to support many protocols simultaneously becomes the best choice. In all cases, communications can fall over many different transports, [[Rs232|RS-232]], [[RS485|RS-485]], [[Ethernet]], etc. Universal Gateways have the ability to communicate between protocols and over different transports simultaneously. == Design of a universal gateway == '''Hardware platform''' - Industrial Computer, Embedded Computer, Computer Appliance '''Communications software''' – Software (Drivers) to support one or more Industrial Protocols. Communications is typically polled or change based. Great care is typically taken to leverage communication protocols for the most efficient transactions of data (Optimized message sizes, communications speeds, and data update rates). Typical protocols; Rockwell Automation CIP, Ethernet/IP, Siemens Industrial Ethernet, Modbus TCP. There are hundreds of automation device protocols and Universal Gateway solutions are typically targeting certain market segments and will be based on automation vendor relationships. '''Bridging software''' – Linking software for connecting data from one device to data in another, one being the source of data and one being the destination. Typically data is transferred on data change, on a time basis, or based on process conditions – Run, Stop, etc. == Universal gateways vs. protocol converters == A universal gateway will typically offer all protocols on a computer appliance, for the benefit of the process engineer, giving them the opportunity to pick and choose one or more protocols, and change them over time, as the application needs demand. [[Protocol converter]]s are typically designed with a single purpose, to convert protocol X to Y, and are not offering the level of configurability and flexibility of a universal gateway. == New markets for universal gateways == Special classes of universal gateway are addressing special needs. The [[Smart grid|Smart Grid]] is now prompting a new class of application where plant floor equipment is tied to electric utilities for the purpose of Demand and Response Control over power
