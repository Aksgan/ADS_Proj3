Then :<math> \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i) - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du= \sum_{\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D}(-1)^{|u|} \int_{[0,1]^{|u|}}{\rm disc}(x_u,1)\frac{\partial^{|u|}}{\partial x_u}f(x_u,1) dx_u. </math> ==The <math>L^2</math> version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality== Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals and sums to the Hlawka-Zaremba identity, we obtain an <math>L^2</math> version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality: :<math> \left|\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i) - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du\right|\le \|f\|_{d}\,{\rm disc}_{d}(\{t_i\}), </math> where :<math> {\rm disc}_{d}(\{t_i\})=\left(\sum_{\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D} \int_{[0,1]^{|u|}}{\rm disc}(x_u,1)^2 dx_u\right)^{1/2} </math> and :<math> \|f\|_{d}=\left(\sum_{u\subseteq D} \int_{[0,1]^{|u|}} \left|\frac{\partial^{|u|}}{\partial x_u}f(x_u,1)\right|^2 dx_u\right)^{1/2}. </math> ==The Erd&#337;s–Turan–Koksma inequality== It is computationally hard to find the exact value of the discrepancy of large point sets. The [[Paul Erd&#337;s|Erd&#337;s]]–[[Turán]]–[[Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma|Koksma]] inequality provides an upper bound. Let ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>N</sub> be points in ''I''<sup>s</sup> and ''H'' be an arbitrary positive integer. Then :<math> D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\leq \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^s \left( \frac{2}{H+1}+ \sum_{0<\|h\|_{\infty}\leq H}\frac{1}{r(h)} \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} e^{2\pi i\langle h,x_n\rangle} \right| \right) </math> where :<math> r(h)=\prod_{i=1}^s\max\{1,|h_i|\}\quad\mbox{for}\quad h=(h_1,\ldots,h_s)\in\Z^s. </math> ==The main conjectures== '''Conjecture 1.''' There is a constant ''c''<sub>s</sub> depending only on the dimension ''s'', such that :<math>D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq c_s\frac{(\ln N)^{s-1}}{N}</math> for any finite point set {''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>N</sub>}. '''Conjecture 2.''' There is a constant ''c''<sup>'</sup><sub>s</sub> depending only on ''s'', such that :<math>D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq c'_s\frac{(\ln N)^{s}}{N}</math> for any infinite sequence ''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>,.... These conjectures are equivalent. They have been proved for ''s'' ≤ 2 by [[W. M. Schmidt]]. In higher dimensions, the corresponding problem is still open. The best-known lower bounds are due to [[K. F. Roth]]. ==The best-known sequences== [[Constructions of low-discrepancy sequences|Constructions of sequences]] are known (due to Faure, Halton, [[John Hammersley|Hammersley]], Sobol', Niederreiter and van der Corput) such that :<math> D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\leq C\frac{(\ln N)^{s}}{N}. </math> where ''C'' is a certain constant, depending on the sequence. After Conjecture 2, these sequences are believed to have the best possible order of convergence. See also: [[van der Corput sequence]], [[Halton sequences]], [[Sobol sequence]]s. ==Lower bounds== Let ''s'' = 1. Then :<math> D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq\frac{1}{2N} </math> for any finite point set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>}. Let ''s'' = 2. W. M. Schmidt proved that for any finite point set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>}, :<math> D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq C\frac{\log N}{N} </math> where :<math> C=\max_{a\geq3}\frac{1}{16}\frac{a-2}{a\log a}=0.02333\dots </math> For arbitrary dimensions ''s'' > 1, K.F. Roth proved that :<math> D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq\frac{1}{2^{4s}}\frac{1}{((s-1)\log2)^\frac{s-1}{2}}\frac{\log^{\frac{s-1}{2}}N}{N} </math> for any finite point set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>}. This bound is the best known for ''s'' > 3. ==Applications== * [[Integral|Integration]] * [[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] * [[Sampling (statistics)|Statistical sampling]] ==References== * {{Citation | last=Kuipers | first=L. | last2= Niederreiter | first2=H. | title = Uniform distribution of sequences | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | date=2005 | isbn=0-486-45019-8 }} * Harald Niederreiter.

It was introduced in X11R6.3 ("Broadway") in 1996, but never achieved wide use. It was disabled by default as of [[X.Org Server]] 7.1, and was removed for version 7.2. X was originally implemented for use with the [[Server (computing)|server]] and [[client (computing)|client]] on the same machine or the same [[local area network]]. By 1996, the [[Internet]] was becoming popular, and X's performance over narrow, slow links was problematic. LBX ran as a [[proxy server]] ('''<tt>lbxproxy</tt>'''). It cached commonly used information &mdash; connection setup, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps and so on &mdash; and [[data compression|compressed]] data transmission over the network link. LBX was never widely deployed as it did not offer significant speed improvements. The slow links it was introduced to help were typically insecure, and [[RFB protocol|RFB]] ([[VNC]]) over a [[secure shell]] connection &mdash; which includes compression &mdash; proved faster than LBX, and also provided session resumption. Finally, it was shown that greater speed improvements to X could be obtained for ''all'' networked environments with replacement of X's antiquated font system as part of the new composited graphics system, along with care and attention to application and [[widget toolkit]] design, particularly care to avoid network [[round-trip delay time|round trips]] and hence [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. == See also == * [[dxpc]] The Differential X Protocol Compressor * [[Virtual Network Computing]] (VNC) * [[xmove]] - a tool allows you to move programs between X Window System displays * [[xpra]] - a more recent tool which is similar to xmove * [[NX technology]], an X acceleration system == References == *[http://www.xfree86.org/current/lbxproxy.1.html lbxproxy(1)] ([[UNIX manual|man page]]) *[http://keithp.com/~keithp/talks/lbx.tar.gz Design and Implementation of LBX: An Experiment Based Standard] (.[[tar (file format)|tar]].[[gzip|gz]] archive file) ([[Keith Packard]], Eighth Annual X Technical Conference, ''The X Resource'' no. 9, O'Reilly & Associates, 1994) *[http://www.broadwayinfo.com/bwfaq.htm Broadway/Xweb FAQ] (broadwayinfo.com) *[http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LBX.html The LBX mini-HOWTO v1.04] (Paul D.
