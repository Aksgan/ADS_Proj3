The name "MOSH" comes from "Mobilize and Share". The channel can be used to both download and upload various content for mobile phones or other platforms. File types that are handled are: audio, images, applications, games, videos, documents. A person can create an account on MOSH that comes with the following stats: creator (for content created by that person), collector (for the number of objects added to the collection in the account) and sharer (for uploading files that are not necessarily the work of that person). <ref>[http://www.intomobile.com/2007/08/09/nokia-launches-mobile-social-network-mosh-by-nokia.html Nokia launches MOSH social network for mobile phones]</ref> MOSH was launched by Nokia in August 2007 and remained in Beta up until its closure. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://mosh.nokia.com/ MOSH] [[Category:Nokia]] [[Category:Networks]] [[Category:Social networks|Nokia]] [[Category:Global internet community]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Social information processing]] [[Category:Web 2.0]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2007]] {{tech-stub}} [[pl:MOSH]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23019</id> <title>MOSIX</title> <text><!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Mosix.gif|thumb|Mosix Cluster]] --> '''MOSIX''' is a [[distributed operating system]].<ref>The MOSIX distributed operating system: Load balancing for UNIX, volume 672 of [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]].
