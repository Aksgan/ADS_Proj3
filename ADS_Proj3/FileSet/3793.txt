includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced, and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final sounds, which were sometimes once pronounced, continue to live a shadowy existence in Classical French versification. They are in almost all of the pre-20th-century French verse texts, but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century it. The most important "silent" letter is the "[[Silent_letter#Vowels|mute e]]". In spoken French today, final "e" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted<!--leads a kind of half-life: this is an abuse of the term "half-life"--> after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. "Joue" could rhyme with "boue", but not with "trou". Rhyming words ending with this silent "e" were said to make up a "feminine rhyme", while words not ending with this silent "e" made up a "masculine rhyme". It was a principle of stanza-formation that masculine and feminine rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. All 17th-century French plays in verse alternate masculine and feminine [[alexandrine]] couplets. The "silent" final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were considered an integral part of the rhyme, so that "pont" could rhyme only with "vont" and not with "long"; but this cannot be reduced to a simple rule about the spelling, since "pont" would also rhyme with "rond" even though one word ends in "t" and the other in "d". This is because the correctness of the rhyme depends not on the spelling on the final consonant, but on how it would have been pronounced. There are a few simple rules that govern word-final consonants in French prosody: * The consonants must "rhyme" ''give or take their voicing''. So "d" and "t" rhyme because they differ only in voicing. So too with "g" and "c", and "p" and "b", and also "s" and "z" (and "x"). (Rhyming words ending with a silent "s" "x" or "z" are called "plural rhymes".) * Nasal vowels rhyme no matter what their spelling. ("Essaim" can rhyme with "sain", but not with "saint" because the final "t" counts in "saint".) * If the word ends in a consonant cluster, only the final consonant counts. ("Temps" rhymes with "lents" because both end in "s".) In fact, only the "silent" final consonants which would be able to be pronounced the same way, if they were followed by a vowel, are able to rhyme together. ===Hebrew=== Ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verse generally did not employ rhyme. However, many [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[liturgy|liturgical]] poems rhyme today, because they were written in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]], where rhymes were in vogue. ===Portuguese=== [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] classifies rhymes in the following manner: *'''rima pobre''' (poor rhyme): rhyme between words of the same [[grammatical category]] (e.g. noun with noun) or between very common endings (''-ão'', ''-ar''); *'''rima rica''' (rich rhyme): rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings; *'''rima preciosa''' (precious rhyme): rhyme between words with a different [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], for example ''estrela'' (star) with ''vê-la'' (to see her); *'''rima esdrúxula''' (odd rhyme): rhyme between [[Proparoxytone|proparoxitonic]] words (example: ''última'', "last", and ''vítima'', "victim"). ===Greek=== :''See [[Homoioteleuton]]'' rhyme ===Latin=== In [[Latin]] rhetoric and poetry [[homeoteleuton]] and [[alliteration]] were frequently used devices. Tail rhyme was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by [[Cicero]]: :''O Fortu'''natam''' '''natam''' me consule '''Romam'''''. :''(O fortunate Rome, to be born with me consul)'' But tail rhyme was not used as a prominent structural feature of [[Latin poetry]] until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early [[Middle Ages]]. This is the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] ''[[Dies Irae]]'': :''Dies irae, dies illa'' :''Solvet saeclum in favilla'' :''Teste David cum Sybilla'' :''(The day of wrath, that day'' :''which will reduce the world to ashes,'' :''as foretold by David and the Sybil.)'' [[Medieval poetry]] may mix Latin and [[vernacular]] languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed [[macaronic]]. ===Sanskrit=== Patterns of rich rhyme (''[[prāsa]]'') play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the ''pada'' (metrical foot): ''ādiprāsa'' (first syllable), ''dvitīyākṣara prāsa'' (second syllable), ''antyaprāsa'' (final syllable) etc. ===Arabic=== The [[Qur’an]] is written in ''[[Saj (literature)|saj‘]]'', a prosaic genre that uses end rhymes. This particular style was widespread in the Arabic peninsula during the time of the Qur’an's appearance. ===Celtic languages=== :''For Welsh, see [[cynghanedd]]'' Rhyming in the [[Celtic Languages]] takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Gaelic languages use little true rhyming and prefer [[assonance]] or the rhyming of vowel sounds within non-rhyming words. Often, pieces with true rhyming are considered awkward to Gaelic speakers, much in the same way many English speakers find the Irish rhyming pattern. Here is an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from ''Bríd Óg Ní Mháille'' by [[The Corrs]]: :''Is a Bhríd Óg Ní Mháille / 'S tú d'fhág mo chroí cráite'' :{{IPA-ga|is ə vrʲiːdʲ oːɡ nʲiː wɒːlʲə / stuː dɒːɡ mə xriː krɒːtʲə|}} Translation: ''Oh Brid Og O'Malley / You have left my heart breaking'' ===Tamil=== There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called ''etukai'' (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line. The effect of ''etukai'', though a little strange at first, rapidly becomes pleasant to the reader, and to the Tamil it is as enjoyable as the end rhyme. The other rhyme and related patterns are called ''mō<u>n</u>ai'' ([[alliteration]]), ''toṭai'' ([[epistrophe|epiphora]]) and ''iraṭṭai kiḷavi'' ([[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]). Some classical Tamil poetry forms, such as ''veṇpā'', have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar. ==Function of rhyme== Partly it seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. It also serves as a
