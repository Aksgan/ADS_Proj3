However, in other rings, division by nonzero elements may also pose problems. For example, the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''' of integers mod 6. The meaning of the expression <math>\textstyle\frac{2}{2}</math> should be the solution ''x'' of the equation <math>2x = 2</math>. But in the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''', 2 is not invertible under multiplication. This equation has two distinct solutions, ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = 4, so the expression <math>\textstyle\frac{2}{2}</math> is [[Defined and undefined|undefined]]. In field theory, the expression <math>\textstyle\frac{a}{b}</math> is only shorthand for the formal expression ''ab''<sup>−1</sup>, where ''b''<sup>−1</sup> is the multiplicative inverse of ''b''. Since the field axioms only guarantee the existence of such inverses for nonzero elements, this expression has no meaning when ''b'' is zero. Modern texts include the axiom 0 ≠ 1 to avoid having to consider the [[trivial ring]] or a "[[field with one element]]", where the multiplicative identity coincides with the additive identity. ==In computer arithmetic== [[File:SpeedCrunch divide by zero.png|thumb|In the SpeedCrunch calculator application, when a number is divided by zero the answer box displays “Error: Divide by zero”.]] [[File:TI86_Calculator_DivByZero.jpg|thumb|Most calculators, such as this Texas Instruments TI-86, will halt execution and display an error message when the user or a running program attempts to divide by zero.]] The [[IEEE floating-point standard]], supported by almost all modern [[floating-point unit]]s, specifies that every [[floating point]] arithmetic operation, including division by zero, has a well-defined result. The standard supports [[signed zero]], as well as [[infinity]] and [[NaN]] (''not a number''). There are two zeroes, +0 (''positive zero'') and −0 (''negative zero'') and this removes any ambiguity when dividing. In [[IEEE 754]] arithmetic, ''a'' ÷ +0 is positive infinity when ''a'' is positive, negative infinity when ''a'' is negative, and NaN when ''a'' = ±0. The infinity signs change when dividing by [[−0 (number)|−0]] instead. Integer division by zero is usually handled differently from floating point since there is no integer representation for the result. Some processors generate an [[exception handling|exception]] when an attempt is made to divide an integer by zero, although others will simply continue and generate an incorrect result for the division. The result depends on how division is implemented, and can either be zero, or sometimes the largest possible integer. Because of the improper algebraic results of assigning any value to division by zero, many computer [[programming language]]s (including those used by [[calculator]]s) explicitly forbid the execution of the operation and may prematurely halt a program that attempts it, sometimes reporting a "Divide by zero" error. In these cases, if some special behavior is desired for division by zero, the condition must be explicitly tested (for example, using an [[if statement]]). Some programs (especially those that use [[fixed-point arithmetic]] where no dedicated floating-point hardware is available) will use behavior similar to the IEEE standard, using large positive and negative numbers to approximate infinities. In some programming languages, an attempt to divide by zero results in [[undefined behavior]]. In [[two's complement]] arithmetic, attempts to divide the smallest signed integer by <math>-1</math> are attended by similar problems, and are handled with the same range of solutions, from explicit error conditions to [[undefined behavior]]. Most calculators will either return an error or state that 1/0 is undefined, however some [[Texas Instruments|TI]] and [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] graphing calculators will evaluate (1/0)<sup>2</sup> to ∞. More advanced [[computer algebra systems]] will return an infinity as a result for division by zero; for instance, [[Microsoft Math]] and [[Mathematica]] will show an ''ComplexInfinity'' result. ===Historical accidents=== * On September 21, 1997, a divide by zero error on board the [[USS Yorktown (CG-48)|USS ''Yorktown'' (CG-48)]] ''Remote Data Base Manager'' brought down all the machines on the network, causing the ship's propulsion system to fail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,13987,00.html|title=Sunk by Windows NT|date=1998-07-24|work=[[Wired News]]}}</ref> ==See also== * [[Asymptote]] * [[Defined and undefined]] * [[Indeterminate form]] * [[Zero divisor]] * [[Zeroth]] == Footnotes == {{reflist}} == References == {{refbegin}} * [[Patrick Suppes]] 1957 (1999 Dover edition), ''Introduction to Logic'', Dover Publications, Inc., Mineola, New York.
