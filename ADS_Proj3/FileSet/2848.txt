in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the [[Western Electric Company]] filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load for the rest of the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a [[ladder topology]] of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a [[bandpass filter]] circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100 Hz to 6 kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced.<ref>Harrison, 1929.</ref> Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.<ref>Harrison, 1930.</ref> [[File:Norton mechanical filter.png|thumb|left|300px|alt=A diagram of a phonograph mechanism with the mechanical impedance of each part shown in an equivalent circuit diagram. The correspondence between mechanical parts and equivalent circuit elements is not indicated on the diagram (this is explained in the text of Norton's patent). A second circuit diagram is shown with the circuit transformed to a form more convenient for analysis as explained in the article text.|'''Figure 3.''' Norton's mechanical filter together with its electrical equivalent circuit.]] Harrison used [[George Ashley Campbell|Campbell]]'s [[constant k filter|image filter]] theory, which was the most advanced filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an [[impedance matching]] problem.<ref>Harrison, 1929, p.2.</ref> More advanced filter theory was brought to bear on this problem by [[Edward Lawry Norton|Norton]] in 1929 at [[Bell Labs]]. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to [[Sidney Darlington|Darlington]] the filter he designed as being "maximally flat".<ref name="Darlington, p.7"/> Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by [[Stephen Butterworth|Butterworth]] who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic [[Butterworth filter|maximally flat filter]].<ref>S. Butterworth, "On the Theory of Filter Amplifiers", ''Wireless Engineer'', '''vol. 7''', 1930, pp. 536–541</ref> The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter, that is, one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, making it hard to recognise the design for what it is.<ref>cf. Norton, p.3 with Matthaei, pp.104–107.</ref> Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the series capacitor, which represents the stiffness of the [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]. This is the only series capacitor in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a [[prototype filter|low-pass prototype]]. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the "[[Equivalent impedance transforms#Transform 5.2|turning round the L]]" impedance transform to achieve this.<ref>Norton, 1930.</ref> The definitive description of the subject from this period is Maxfield and Harrison's 1926 paper. There, they describe not only how mechanical bandpass filters can be applied to sound reproduction systems, but also apply the same principles to recording systems and describe a much improved disc cutting head.<ref>Taylor & Huang, p.360.</ref><ref>Hunt, p.68 cites<br />J.P. Maxfield and H.C. Harrison, "Methods of high quality recording and reproducing of music and speech based on telephone research", ''Bell Systems Technical Journal'', '''vol 5''', pp.493–523, 1926.</ref> ===Volume production=== The first volume production of mechanical filters was undertaken by [[Collins Radio|Collins Radio Company]] starting in the 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone frequency-division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of [[guard band]], which in turn leads to the ability to squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable. This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason. Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, [[amateur radio]] and the like) manufactured by Collins. They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent ''LC'' filter. High ''Q'' allows filters to be designed which have high [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers. They also had an advantage in stability over both ''LC'' filters and monolithic crystal filters. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500 kHz band.<ref>Taylor & Huang, p.359.</ref><ref>Carr, pp.54–55.</ref> ==Transducers== [[File:Mechanical filter transducers.svg|thumb|250px|alt=Three different transducers are depicted. (a) A metal rod with one end passing through a cylinder of magnetostrictive material on which is wound a coil of enamelled copper wire. (b) An upright cylindrical resonator in which there is sandwiched a horizontal layer of piezoelectric material. The Piezoelectric layer has an embedded electrode from which is leading an enamelled copper wire. (c) An upright cylindrical resonator in which there is sandwiched a vertical layer of piezoelectric material with an electrode as in (b).|'''Figure 4.''' Mechanical filter transducers. '''a''' magnetostrictive transducer. '''b''' Langevin type piezoelectric transducer. '''c''' torsional piezoelectric transducer.]] There are two general types of [[transducer]]s used with mechanical filters: [[magnetostrictive]] and [[piezoelectric]]. Piezoelectric is favoured in more recent designs since the piezoelectric material can also be used as one of the resonators of the filter, thus reducing the number of components and thereby saving space. They also avoid the susceptibility to extraneous magnetic fields from which the magnetostrictive type suffers.<ref>Taylor
