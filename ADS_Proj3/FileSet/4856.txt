WorkNC Dental has an easy to use [[Graphical user interface|graphic user interface]] designed for labs and [[dental technicians]] who are not machining experts. It is the closest thing to a « one button CAM » for the dental sector and has been developed and tested in collaboration with dental professionals and [[Professional body|professional bodies]]. Its automatic 3 and 5-axis toolpaths combine with technology for nesting and orientating prosthetic implants. Additionally, tools for adding support pins and identification markings make the software an ideal solution for rapid [[prosthesis]] manufacture. STL and native dental CAD formats are imported into WorkNC Dental ready for “machining [[Wizard_(software)|wizards]]” to guide the user through the manufacturing process. The system automatically selects tools, machining sequences and cutting conditions optimized for particular types of material, such as [[chrome]]-[[cobalt]], [[titanium]] and [[zirconia]], and for particular prostheses, such as copings and bridges. The intricate nature of some implants requires the use of 5-axis machining methods to reach every part of the job. Traditionally requiring highly skilled programmers, WorkNC Dental overcomes this problem with its automated 5-axis software. Intelligence within the system considers the limitations and kinematics of the machine tool itself to automatically produce reliable and collision free 5-axis toolpaths. === WorkNC MPM (Multi-Part Machining) === WorkNC MPM is a CAD/CAM module that allows users to easily machine multiple parts simultaneously on the same machine. Operators are confronted by a number of problems as a result of multiple tool changes (collision management, down time and lack of precision). WorkNC's MPM module eliminates these problems and offers productivity gains by optimizing the machining operations. No programming is required and no supplementary part origin data need to be defined. There is also a significant reduction in the number of tool changes required. Problems due to incorrect tool numbering are eliminated, and there are no collisions between the parts. The use of predefined [[pallet]] systems ensures rapid and safe machining. MPM can consider a complete pallet load of [[Electrical_discharge_machining#Sinker_EDM|electrodes]] as one part, using each tool across all the electrodes on the pallet. The software ensures collision-free cutter paths as it moves across the job, and eliminates the many tool change operations that would otherwise be required. MPM automatically determines a safe retract height above the tallest electrode, and the clear graphics enable the programmer to identify the slightest potential problem. The main benefits of WorkNC MPM are: No programming is necessary on the machine, Simple and reliable part positioning, Unsupervised machining, Optimal use of clamping assemblies and palettes, Significant reduction in number of tool changes, Flexibility and adaptability during modifications, Part symmetry and rotation without having to recalculate toolpaths. === WorkNC LMP (Layer Milling Process) === WorkNC LMP is a CAD/CAM software for cutting parts in layers, a well-known technique for machining deep and narrow cavities<ref>Layer milling for [[rapid prototyping]], “[http://www.sescoi.com/index.php?id=pr&pr=wnclmp&L=6 Kegelmann Technik Gmbh uses WorkNC Layer Milling Process (LMP)]”</ref>. WorkNC-LMP automatically divides 3D models and creates roughing and finishing toolpaths for each layer<ref>Machining videos, “[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyCjwH3EI3c CNC Layer Milling - Machining from Zimmermann/WorkNC]”</ref>. This technology can be used on any [[Machining_center#Computer_numerical_control|machining center]], simplifying the programming and cutting of complex shapes by building them up in manageable sections. Sescoi worked in collaboration with F. Zimmermann, combining the speed and accuracy of the dedicated Zimmermann LMC (Layer Milling Centre) with Sescoi's WorkNC-LMP. By using the software in conjunction with the machine all the toolpaths and special machine control sequences are automatically generated to cut parts in unmanned operation. The LMC works from underneath, using high-speed techniques to machine each layer in turn. As each layer is roughed and finished a new plate is bonded, ready for the next machining operation, this continues until the finished part is built up. WorkNC-LMP automates this process starting from the CAD model, firstly splitting it into layers, and then generating both the roughing and finishing toolpaths for each layer. This technique is ideal for high speed machining enabling the use of short and rigid cutters, and eliminates the possibility of a collision. WorkNC-LMP allows to select the material from a materials library and controls factors such as surface roughening prior to bonding, cutting adhesive channels to control excess glue, overlapping of cutter paths to remove traces of glue, and paths for the application of adhesive between layers. It provides the visual control of all toolpaths and the calculation of the estimated total machining time. WorkNC-LMP combines the advantages of generative [[rapid prototyping]] with conventional machining, and is the latest example of the company's resolve to make new processes a reality for its customers. === WorkNC Wire EDM === WorkNC Wire EDM is a CAD/CAM software for Wire [[Electrical discharge machining]]. [[Dialog box]]es guide the user through the system. Functions within WorkNC Wire EDM allow the extraction of [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sections]], ready for 2- or 4-axis cutting.
