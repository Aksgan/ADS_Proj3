patterns and therefore not perform its operation. IP fragmentation is dealt with the connection tracking subsystem requiring defragmentation, though [[TCP segment]]ation is not handled. In case of FTP, segmentation is deemed not to happen “near” a command like PASV with standard segment sizes, so is not dealt with in Netfilter either. == Network Address Translation == Each connection has a set of ''original addresses'' and ''reply addresses'', which initially start out the same. NAT in Netfilter is implemented by simply changing the reply address, and where desired, port. When packets are received, their connection tuple will also be compared against the reply address pair (and ports). Being fragment-free is also a requirement for NAT. (If need be, IPv4 packets may be refragmented by the normal, non-Netfilter, IPv4 stack.) === NAT helpers === Similar to connection tracking helpers, NAT helpers will do a packet inspection and substitute original addresses by reply addresses in the payload. == Further Netfilter projects == Though not being kernel modules that make use of Netfilter code directly, the Netfilter project hosts a few more noteworthy software. === ulogd === Ulogd is a user-space daemon to receive and log packets and event notifications from the Netfilter subsystems. ip_tables can deliver packets via the userspace queuing mechanism to it, and connection tracking can interact with ulogd to exchange further information about packets or events (such as connection teardown, NAT setup). === conntrack-tools === ''Conntrack-Tools'' is a set of user-space tools for Linux that allow system administrators to interact with the Connection Tracking entries and tables. The package includes the ''conntrackd'' daemon and the command line interface ''conntrack''. The userspace daemon ''conntrackd'' can be used to enable high availability cluster-based stateful firewalls and collect statistics of the stateful firewall use. The command line interface ''conntrack'' provides a more flexible interface to the connection tracking system than the obsolete <tt>/proc/net/nf_conntrack</tt>. === ipset === Unlike other extensions such as Connection Tracking, ipset<ref>http://ipset.netfilter.org/</ref> is more related to iptables than it is to the core Netfilter code. ipset does not make use of Netfilter hooks for instance, but actually provides an iptables module to match and do minimal modifications (set/clear) to IP sets. The user-space tool called '''ipset''' is used to set up, maintain and inspect so called “IP sets” in the Linux kernel. An IP set usually contains a set of [[IP address]]es, but can also contain sets of other network numbers, depending on its “type”. These sets are much more lookup-efficient than bare iptables rules, but of course may come with a greater memory footprint. Different storage algorithms (for the data structures in memory) are provided in ipset for the user to select an optimum solution. Any entry in one set can be bound to another set, allowing for sophisticated matching operations. A set can only be removed (destroyed) if there are no iptables rules or other sets referring to it. === User-space libraries === The Netfilter projects also provides a set of libraries whose prefix name is ''libnetfilter'' that can be used to perform different task from user-space. These libraries are released under the GNU GPL version 2. Specifically, they are: * '''libnetfilter_queue''', that allows to perform user-space packet queuing in conjunction with iptables. * '''libnetfilter_conntrack''', that allows to manipulate Connection Tracking entries from user-space. * '''libnetfilter_log''', that allows to collect log messages that are generated by iptables. * '''libiptc''', that allows changing the iptables firewall ruleset. ==Netfilter workshops== The Netfilter project organize an annual meeting for developers which is used to discuss on-going research and development efforts. The last Netfilter Workshop took place in Paris, France, at the end of September 2008. ==See also== {{Portal box|Free software|Computer security}} *[[ipchains]], the predecessor to iptables *[[ipfirewall|ipfw]] *[[PF (firewall)]] *[[Netlink]], an API used by Netfilter extensions ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== Homepages: * [http://netfilter.org/ Netfilter/iptables project homepage] * [http://netfilter.org/projects/conntrack-tools/ conntrack-tools homepage] * [http://ipset.netfilter.org/ ipset homepage] * [http://netfilter.org/projects/ulogd/ ulogd homepage] The Workshop: * [http://workshop.netfilter.org/ Home of the Netfilter Workshop websites] * [http://nfws.inl.fr/en Workshop résumé/blog] Documentation: * [http://jengelh.medozas.de/documents/Netfilter_Modules.pdf “Writing Netfilter Modules” e-book] (2009) * [http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2817396,00_print.html Netfilter and Iptables -- Stateful Firewalling for Linux] (October 11, 2001) {{Firewall software}} [[Category:Free network-related software]] [[Category:Firewall software]] [[Category:Free security software]] [[ar:نت فيلتر]] [[ca:Iptables]] [[de:Netfilter]] [[es:Netfilter]] [[fr:Netfilter]] [[it:Netfilter]] [[lv:Netfilter/iptables]] [[mk:Iptables]] [[ja:Iptables]] [[no:Netfilter]] [[pl:Netfilter]] [[pt:Netfilter]] [[ru:Netfilter]] [[fi:Iptables]] [[zh:Iptables]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26124</id> <title>Netlib</title> <text>'''Netlib''' is a repository of software for [[scientific computing]] maintained by [[AT&T]], [[Bell Laboratories]], the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]<ref>[http://www.netlib.org/misc/faq.html#2.1 Netlib FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.
