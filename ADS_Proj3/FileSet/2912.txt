Server]], and [[Microsoft Office]] macro settings. Security updates are determined by the current version of MBSA using the [[Microsoft Update|Windows Update Agent]] present on Windows computers since Windows 2000 Service Pack 3. The less-secure settings, often called Vulnerability Assessment (VA) checks, are assessed based on a hard-coded set of registry and file checks. An example of a VA might be that permissions for one of the directories in the wwwroot folder of IIS could be set at too low a level, allowing unwanted modification of files from outsiders. Versions 1.2.1 and below run on NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, provide support for IIS versions 5 through 6, SQL Server 7 and 2000, [[Internet Explorer]] 5.01 and 6.0 only, and Microsoft Office 2000 through 2003. Security update assessment is provided by an integrated version of [[Shavlik|Shavlik's]] HFNetChk 3.8 scan tool. MBSA 1.2.1 was localized into English, German, French and Japanese versions and supported security assessment for any locale. Version 2.0 retained the hard-coded VA checks, but replaced the Shavlik security assessment engine with Microsoft Update technologies which adds dynamic support for all Microsoft products supported by [[Windows Update|Microsoft Update]]. MBSA 2.0.1 was released to support the revised Windows Update (WU) offline scan file (WSUSSCN2.CAB). MBSA 2.1 added Vista and Windows Server 2008 support, a new Vista-styled GUI interface, support for the latest Windows Update Agent (3.0), a new Remote Directory (/rd) feature and extended the VA checks to x64 platforms. ==References== {{Reflist|refs= <ref name="mbsa-1">{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b13ebd6b-e258-4625-b0a3-64a4879f7798&displaylang=en | title=Download Details: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer v1.2.1 (for IT Professionals) | publisher=Microsoft Corporation | accessdate=13 October 2009 }}</ref> <ref name="mbsa-2">{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b1e76bbe-71df-41e8-8b52-c871d012ba78&displaylang=en | title=Download Details: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer v2.1.1 (for IT Professionals) | publisher=Microsoft Corporation | accessdate=21 November 2009 }}</ref> }} {{Portal|Computer security}} {{Portal|Computing}} ==External links== * [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc184924.aspx Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer] at Microsoft * [http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.security.baseline_analyzer Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer] Newsgroup * [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc184925.aspx Visio Connector for MBSA] {{Microsoft Security Products}} [[Category:Microsoft software|Baseline Security Analyzer]] [[Category:Computer security software]] [[Category:Operating system security]] [[Category:Windows-only freeware]] [[de:Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer]] [[fa:تحلیل‌گر امنیتی پایه مایکروسافت]] [[fr:MBSA]] [[zh:微軟基線安全分析器]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24438</id> <title>Microsoft BizTalk Server</title> <text>'''Microsoft BizTalk Server''', often referred to as simply "BizTalk", is an [[Enterprise_service_bus|Enterprise Service Bus]]. Through the use of "adapters" which are tailored to communicate with different software systems used in a large enterprise, it enables companies to automate business processes. Offered by [[Microsoft]], it provides the following functions: [[Enterprise Application Integration]], [[Business Process Automation]], [[Business-to-business]] Communication, [[Message broker]], and [[Business Activity Monitoring]]. In a common scenario, BizTalk enables companies to integrate and manage automated business processes by exchanging business documents such as purchase orders and invoices between disparate applications, within or across organizational boundaries. Human-centric processes cannot be implemented directly with BizTalk Server and need additional solutions like [[Microsoft SharePoint]] server. Development for BizTalk Server is done through [[Microsoft Visual Studio]]. A developer can create transformation maps transforming one message type to another (for example an XML file can be transformed to SAP [[IDoc]]s, etc.). Maps are created visually using a graphical builder provided within Microsoft Visual Studio. The additional functionality can be delivered by .Net assemblies that can be called from existing modules including for instance maps or adapters. Data transformations (maps) and even processing is organised in orchestrations that provide the visual view of processing (it is a program written in a graphical language). ==Versions for Windows== * 2000 - BizTalk Server 2001 * 2002 - BizTalk Server 2002 * 2004 - BizTalk Server 2004 (First version to run on [[Microsoft .NET]] 1.0) * 2006 - BizTalk Server 2006 (First version to run on Microsoft .NET 2.0) * 2007 - BizTalk Server 2006 R2 (First version to utilize the new [[Windows Communication Foundation]] via native adapter - (Release date October 2 2007)) * 2009 - BizTalk Server 2009 (First version to work with [[Visual Studio 2008]]) * 2010 - BizTalk Server 2010<ref>{{citeweb|title=BizTalk 2009 R2 gets a new name; still due in 2010|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=5656|publisher=''[[ZDNet]]''}}</ref> (First version to work with [[Visual Studio 2010]]) ==Features== The following is an incomplete list of some of the technical features in the BizTalk Server: *The use of adapters to simplify integration to Line of Business Applications (eg. Siebel, [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Industrial and Financial Systems|IFS Applications]], JD Edwards, Oracle, Dynamics CRM), Databases ([[Microsoft SQL Server]], Oracle, [[IBM DB2|DB2]]) and other Technologies ([[Tibco]], [[Java EE]], etc) *An engine for modelling Business Rules in a pseudo-English format. This is a [[forward chaining]] [[rule engine]]. *[[Business Activity Monitoring]] (BAM), which allows a dashboard, graphical view on how the modelled Business Processes are doing. *A unified Administration [[Dashboard]] for monitoring deployments of solutions, etc on BizTalk servers in your environment. *Built-in EDI ([[Electronic Data Interchange]]) functionality supporting [[ASC X12|X12]] and [[EDIFACT]].(BizTalk 2006 R2) *Accelerators which offer support for standards like [[RosettaNet]], [[HL7]], [[SWIFT]], etc. *Ability to do graphical modelling of business processes in visual studio, graphically mapping (with the assistance of [[functoid]]s) between different message formats, and building pipelines to decrypt, verify, parse messages as they enter the system via adapters. *Users can automate business management processes via [[Orchestration (computers)|Orchestrations]]. *BizTalk integrates with other Microsoft products like [[Microsoft Office|Office]], [[InfoPath]] and [[SharePoint]] to allow interaction with a user participating in a workflow process. *Extensive support for [[Webservices]] (consuming and exposing) *[[RFID]] support as of BizTalk 2006 R2 ==Architecture== The BizTalk Server runtime is built on a [[publish/subscribe]] architecture, sometimes called "content-based publish/subscribe". Messages are published into the system, and then received by one or more active subscribers.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Runtime architecture|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa562161.aspx|publisher=''[[Microsoft Developer Network]]''|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> BizTalk makes processing safe by serializing (called dehydration in Biztalk's terminology) messages into database while waiting for external events, thus preventing data loss. This architecture binds BizTalk with [[Microsoft SQL Server]]. Processing flow can be tracked by administrators using a graphical UI. ==Adapters== BizTalk uses adapters for communications with different protocols, and specific software products such as [[SharePoint]]. Some of the adapters that were included in Server 2006 product included the Base [[Electronic_Data_Interchange|EDI]] (Covast), File, [[HTTP]], [[FTP]], [[SMTP]], [[POP3]], [[SOAP]], [[SQL]], [[MSMQT]], [[Web Services Enhancements]] (WSE) 2.0, and the
