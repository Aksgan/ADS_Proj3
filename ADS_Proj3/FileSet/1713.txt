owned by [[Bain Capital]] and Dunn & Bradstreet. Gartner Group is generally recognized as the world's leading "advisory consulting" firm in the IT industries, based on annual revenues and [[market share]]. == Soundview Technologies == {{main|SoundView Technology Group}} Mr. Gartner, who had retained contact with his Wall Street clients, initiated a new financial service for Gartner Group via a new partnership with [[Dillon, Read & Co.]], which distributed its reports and [[Personal Services|personal services]] to [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] investment client organizations. Gartner Group severed the Dillon Read relationship and became an independent [[broker-dealer]] in 1984, named Gartner Securities Corp., and spun this business out to its shareholders just before its first public offering in 1986, providing its analysis, investment advice and banking services, to all institutional investors. Its name was changed in 1988 to [[SoundView Technology Group]], when Gartner was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. Soundview was unique in that it combined accepted Wall Street research and distribution methods, with the intimate (albeit "arms length") relationship with Gartner analysts, and arguably became the leading technology research boutique on Wall Street. But it merged in 2000 with Wit Capital, and was eventually sold (early 2004) to [[Charles Schwab]] Company, and thereafter completely absorbed into Schwab and UBS. == GiGa Information Group == Giga Information Group was founded by Mr. Gartner in 1995. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> He raised more than $15 million in several tranches to develop the company; he was Chairman and CEO until late 1999. In less than four years from first shipment (April 1, 1996 to December 1999), this innovative firm became the fastest growing technology advisory consulting company in history, generating a [[run rate]] from zero to over $65 million, with more than 1,200 enterprise clients. Three primary innovations were introduced to the advisory business through Giga <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=lhJ3TocQ4ZsC&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=%22gideon+gartner%22&source=web&ots=wFyqoLs57U&sig=XWPfk1w4ODmfHm8F-y2wGkG9ptI 403 Forbidden<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>: its offering of a single comprehensive IT Advisory service (compared with the typical multiple services of other advisory firms), an external cadre of experts to supplement the strategic nature of analysts on staff, and a set of web functions which stressed objectivity of analysis, and allowed on-line research by clients (called “The Knowledge Salon”). Giga went public in 1998, but its stock languished during and after the technology stock market meltdown of 2000. In February 2003 the company was sold to Forrester Research. == Lifestyle and philanthropy == Mr. Gartner lives in [[Aspen, Colorado]] and the New York area, and is involved in business ventures, athletics and classical music.
