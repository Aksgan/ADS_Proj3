According to [[Alexa ranking]], its page views surpassed [[MySpace China]] briefly in November 2008 and December 2008. ==Launch== FaceKoo ({{zh|s=飞思酷|t=飛思酷|p=fēi'sī'kù}}) is a creation of FaceKoo, Inc., a [[privately held company]] based in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. It is a leading [[next generation]] social networking site (SNS) created specifically for the young age group of the Chinese-language market. FaceKoo was created by co-founders Calvin Pak, [[CEO]], David Yan, [[Chief technical officer]], and Sheryl Liu, [[CMO]] - all U.S.-educated [[Chinese American]]s with extensive business track records in the [[Silicon Valley]]. Its name derived from the words "face" and "cool," FaceKoo's flagship MagicMirror product offers a new way of meeting friends via a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[face-recognition]] system. FaceKoo also offers games and other applications for users to interact more easily and in a more fun way. FaceKoo was launched in [[China]] in March 2008, and since then has expanded rapidly. As of June 2009, It has over 1 million registered users, and is one of China's fastest growing social network sites. ==Competition== Despite very little [[advertising]] [[revenue]], and no sponsors, FaceKoo managed to outcompete its [[competitor]]s. FaceKoo's daily ranking is now ahead of [[360quan]] - a major rival that has received more than $20 million USD in funding. Also, FaceKoo's page views have exceeded [[Cyworld China]] (number one site in [[Korea]]), and [[iPart China]] (number one site in Taiwan). Both companies are spending heavily on marketing in China every month. ==See also == *[[Renren]] *[[List of social networking websites]] *[[Internet in China]] ==References== * [http://finance.yahoo.com/tech-ticker/article/148141/Social-Networking-by-the-Billion?tickers=yhoo,ebay,%5Eixic,nws Social Networking by the Billion], Yahoo!

FRGC developed new face recognition techniques and prototype systems while increasing performance by an order of magnitude. The FRGC was open to face recognition researchers and developers in companies, academia, and research institutions. FRGC ran from May 2004 to March 2006. The FRGC consisted of progressively difficult challenge problems. Each challenge problem consisted of a data set of facial images and a defined set of experiments. One of the impediments to developing improved face recognition is the lack of data. The FRGC challenge problems include sufficient data to overcome this impediment. The set of defined experiments assists researchers and developers in making progress on meeting the new performance goals. There are three main contenders for improving face recognition algorithms: high resolution images, three-dimensional (3D) face recognition, and new preprocessing techniques. The FRGC is simultaneously pursuing and will assess the merit of all three techniques. Current face recognition systems are designed to work on relatively small still facial images. The traditional method for measuring the size of a face is the number of [[pixel]]s between the centers of the eyes. In current images there are 40 to 60 pixels between the centers of the eyes (10,000 to 20,000 pixels on the face). In the FRGC, high resolution images consist of facial images with 250 pixels between the centers of the eyes on average. The FRGC will facilitate the development of new [[algorithm]]s that take advantage of the additional information inherent in high resolution images. Three-dimensional (3D) face recognition algorithms identify faces from the 3D shape of a person's face. In current face recognition systems, changes in lighting ([[lighting|illumination]]) and pose of the face reduce performance. Because the shape of faces is not affected by changes in lighting or pose, 3D face recognition has the potential to improve performance under these conditions. In the last couple years there have been advances in [[computer graphics]] and computer vision on modeling lighting and pose changes in facial imagery. These advances have led to the development of new computer algorithms that can automatically correct for lighting and pose changes in facial imagery. These new algorithms work by preprocessing a facial image to correct for lighting and pose prior to being processed through a face recognition system. The preprocessing portion of the FRGC will measure the impact of new preprocessing algorithms on recognition performance. The FRGC improved the capabilities of automatic face recognition systems through experimentation with clearly stated goals and challenge problems. Researchers and developers
