to the [[vague topology]], of the class of Poisson measures {{harv|Stroock|1993|loc=§3.2}}. Many applications of the convolution power rely on being able to define the analog of [[analytic function]]s as [[formal power series]] with powers replaced instead by the convolution power. Thus if <math>\textstyle{F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n}</math> is an analytic function, then one would like to be able to define :<math>F^*(x) = a_0\delta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n x^{*n}.</math> If ''x'' &isin; ''L''<sup>1</sup>('''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>) or more generally is a finite Borel measure on '''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>, then the latter series converges absolutely in norm provided that the norm of ''x'' is less than the radius of convergence of the original series defining ''F''(''z''). In particular, it is possible for such measures to define the '''complex exponential''' :<math>\exp^*(x) = \delta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^{*n}}{n!}.</math> It is not generally possible to extend this definition to arbitrary distributions, although a class of distributions on which this series still converges in an appropriate weak sense is identified by {{harvtxt|Ben Chrouda|El Oued|Ouerdiane|2002}}. As [[convolution algebra]]s are special cases of [[Hopf algebra]]s, the convolution power is a special case of the (ordinary) power in a Hopf algebra. In applications to [[quantum field theory]], the convolution exponential, convolution logarithm, and other analytic functions based on the convolution are constructed as formal power series in the elements of the algebra {{harv|Brouder|Frabetti|Patras|2008}}. If, in addition, the algebra is a [[Banach algebra]], then convergence of the series can be determined as above. In the formal setting, familiar identities such as :<math>x = \log^*(\exp^*x) = \exp^*(\log^*x)</math> continue to hold. Moreover, by the permanence of functional relations, they hold at the level of functions, provided all expressions are well-defined in an open set by convergent series. ==Properties== If ''x'' is itself suitably differentiable, then the [[Convolution#Differentiation|properties]] of convolution, one has :<math>\mathcal{D}\big\{x^{*n}\big\} = (\mathcal{D}x) * x^{*(n-1)} = x * \mathcal{D}\big\{x^{*(n-1)}\big\}</math> where <math>\mathcal{D}</math> denotes the [[derivative]] operator. Specifically, this holds if ''x'' is a compactly supported distribution or lies in the [[Sobolev space]] ''W''<sup>1,1</sup> to ensure that the derivative is sufficiently regular for the convolution to be well-defined. ==See also== *[[Convolution]] *[[Convolution theorem]] *[[Fourier transform]] *[[Taylor series]] ==References== * {{Citation | last1=Ben Chrouda | first1=Mohamed | last2=El Oued | first2=Mohamed | last3=Ouerdiane | first3=Habib | title=Convolution calculus and applications to stochastic differential equations | id={{MathSciNet | id = 1953702}} | year=2002 | journal=Soochow Journal of Mathematics | issn=0250-3255 | volume=28 | issue=4 | pages=375–388}}. * {{Citation | last1=Brouder|first1=Christian|last2=Frabetti|first2=Alessandra|last3=Patras|first3=Frédéric|title=Decomposition into one-particle irreducible Green functions in many-body physics|year=2008|id={{Arxiv|0803.3747}}}}. * {{Citation | last1=Feller | first1=William | author1-link=William Feller | title=An introduction to probability theory and its applications.

This is usually the application of noise-reduction, though other types of processing may have been applied, such as lens-correction. Generally-speaking, in a digital camera the image sensor captures and converts light from a scene into a 2D array of voltages (see [[image sensor]] array , and this 2D array of voltages is converted further into an array of RGB values stored in binary format. Usually some sort of image-correction is implicit in this conversion, as a 2D sensor is not perfect and distortions in the image data arise out of manufacturing variations such as the non-uniformity of pixel area across the sensor. Such distortions are commonly corrected across the sensor in order to balance per-pixel optical gain and thus restore imaging uniformity to the array. Cooked raw corrections go beyond basic pixel-normalization to the area of image improvement. The point of outputting raw data from a digital camera is to provide the raw, unprocessed, unfiltered, sensor data. As such cooked raw is an oxymoron. However it is justified in the eyes of some{{Who|date=May 2010}} by the fact that no manufacturer of digital equipment actually provides truly raw image-data. This is true in the same sense that no one actually drives the posted speed limit but to take such a position is to bastardize both the meaning and the intent of raw-shooting. Clearly there is a difference between corrections applied to provide for uniform SNR across pixels, and corrections applied to maximize SNR at the expense of linear resolution. Cooked raw is clearly in the latter camp along with concepts such as digital zoom. ==References== <!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/eng/Insights/Half-cooked-RAW http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/eng/DxOMark-Sensor/DxOMark-reviews/DxOMark-review-for-the-Sony-Alpha-700 http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslra850/page4.asp http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/E5D2/E5D2RAW.HTM ==External links== * [http://www.example.com/ example.com] <!--- Categories ---> [[Category:Digital photography]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}} {{Comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8113</id> <title>Cool Water (perfume)</title> <text>'''Cool Water''' is a [[perfume]] introduced in 1988 by Davidoff, now a part of [[Coty,_Inc.|Coty Prestige]].<ref>Drier, Melissa [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-113469856.html Davidoff Reaches New Depths (Davidoff men's scent (Cool Water Deep))] WWD February 20 2004 retrieved 22 March 2010</ref> The [[perfumer]] is Pierre Bourdon.<ref>[http://www.dameor.fr/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=45&Itemid=66] retrieved 22 March 2010</ref>.
