4 systems === {{Main|AmigaOS 4}} [[Image:AmigaOS 4.1 Update 2.png|right|thumb|[[AmigaOS 4.1]] Update 2]] AmigaOS 4 (OS4) is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems and currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, and on the PPC Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by Amiga Inc. AmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006. Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company which is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards. AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007. The most recent release AmigaOS is 4.1.<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/amigaos41-ars.ars/5 It's alive!: Ars reviews AmigaOS 4.1], Ars Technica, September 22, 2008.</ref> No new Amiga hardware has been released since the AmigaOne; however [[Acube Systems]] has entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.<ref>[http://www.acube-systems.biz/eng/news.php?id=35 ''OEM Version of AmigaOS 4.1 for Sam440ep imminent''], Acube Systems, September 17, 2008</ref> In 2009 version for [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Bplan|bPlan GmbH]] was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.<ref>[http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4740 ''AmigaOS 4.1 for Pegasos II''], Hyperion Entertainment, January 31, 2009</ref> Moreover, in 2009/2010, A-Eon Technology announced the [[AmigaOne X1000]]. === Amiga hardware clones === Long-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their [http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=43 DraCo] [[Non-linear editing system|nonlinear video edit]] system. It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by Motorola's [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video I/O. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro II|ZORRO-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of 30 MB/sec transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|ZORRO-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing. In 1998, [[Index Information]] released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the [[Amiga 1200|A1200]], but on a motherboard which could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%"|5 1/4" drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs [[AmigaOS]] 3.1. In 2006, two new Amiga-clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren. Referred to as "new Amiga hardware",<ref name="minimig">[http://home.hetnet.nl/~weeren001/minimig.html HetNet.nl]</ref> the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and Gary chips as well as both 8520 CIA's and implements a simple version of Amber. The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.<ref name="minimig"/> The design for Minimig was released as Open Source on July 25, 2007. In February, 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for harddrive images. The minimig core is being ported to the FPGArcade "Replay" board. The Replay uses a larger FPGA which will support the AGA chipset and a 63030 soft core. The Replay board is designed to emulate many older computers and classic arcade machines. The second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.<ref name="individual">[http://siliconsonic.de/news/news118_e.htm SiliconSonic.de]</ref> === Emulation === {{Main|Amiga emulation}} Like many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been the target of various emulation projects so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[FPGA]] chips.<ref>[http://www.acube-systems.biz/index.php?page=news&id=23 "Minimig available" announcement by Acube Systems]</ref> One of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems. == Operating systems == === AmigaOS === {{Main|AmigaOS}} {{Rquote|left|"[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]].

It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Old versions (1.0-3.9) run on the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors, while the newer [[AmigaOS 4]] runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.<ref>[http://www.amiga.com/amigaos/ Amiga.com]</ref> Another notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computer)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and
