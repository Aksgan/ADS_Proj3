to a system for naming [[chemical compound]]s. Earlier in the history of chemistry substances were given name by their discoverer, which often led to some confusion and difficulty. However, today the IUPAC system of chemical nomenclature allows chemists to specify by name specific compounds amongst the vast variety of possible chemicals. The standard nomenclature of chemical substances is set by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). There are well-defined systems in place for naming chemical species. [[Organic compound]]s are named according to the [[organic nomenclature]] system.<ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/ IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry]</ref> [[Inorganic compound]]s are named according to the [[inorganic nomenclature]] system.<ref>IUPAC Provisional Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry (2004) [http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/connelly_310804.html]</ref> In addition the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] has devised a method to index chemical substance. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as [[CAS registry number]]. ===Molecule=== {{Main|Molecule}} A ''molecule'' is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure [[chemical substance]] that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. Molecules can exist as electrically neutral units unlike [[ions]]. Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by [[covalent bond]]s, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in [[lone pair]]s. [[Image:Taxol.svg|400px|thumb|A molecular structure depicts the bonds and relative positions of atoms in a molecule such as that in [[Paclitaxel]] shown here]] Not all substances consist of discrete molecules. Most chemical elements are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit. Other types of substances, such as [[ionic compounds]] and [[network solids]], are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules ''per se''. Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of [[formula unit]]s or [[unit cell]]s as the smallest repeating structure within the substance; as they lack identifiable molecules. One of the main characteristic of a molecule is its geometry often called its [[molecular structure|structure]]. While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature. ===Mole and amount of substance=== {{Main|Mole (unit)}} Mole is a unit to measure [[amount of substance]] (also called chemical amount). A [[mole (unit)|mole]] is the amount of a [[Chemical substance|substance]] that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules or ions) as there are atoms in 0.012 [[kilogram]] (or 12 [[gram]]s) of [[carbon-12]], where the carbon-12 atoms are unbound, at rest and in their [[ground state]].<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/ Official SI Unit definitions]</ref> The number of entities per mole is known as the [[Avogadro constant]], and is determined empirically. The currently accepted value is 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} mol<sup>−1</sup> (2007 [[CODATA]]). One way to understand the meaning of the term "mole" is to compare and contrast it to terms such as [[dozen]]. Just as one dozen eggs contains 12 individual eggs, one mole contains 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} atoms, molecules or other particles. The term is used because it is much easier to say, for example, 1 mole of carbon, than it is to say 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} carbon atoms, and because moles of chemicals represent a scale that is easy to experience. The amount of substance of a solute per volume of [[solution]] is known as amount of substance concentration, or [[molarity]] for short. Molarity is the quantity most commonly used to express the [[concentration]] of a solution in the chemical laboratory. The most commonly used units for molarity are mol/L (the official SI units are mol/m<sup>3</sup>). ===Ions and salts=== {{Main|Ion}} An ''ion'' is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. Positively charged [[cations]] (e.g. [[sodium]] cation Na<sup>+</sup>) and negatively charged [[anions]] (e.g. [[chloride]] Cl<sup>−</sup>) can form a crystalline lattice of neutral [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s (e.g. [[sodium chloride]] NaCl). Examples of [[polyatomic ion]]s that do not split up during [[Acid-base reaction theories|acid-base reactions]] are [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>−</sup>) and [[phosphate]] (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>). Ions in the gaseous phase are often known as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. ===Acidity and basicity=== {{Main|Acid–base reaction}} A substance can often be classified as an [[acid]] or a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior. The simplest is [[Arrhenius acid|Arrhenius theory]], which states than an acid is a substance that produces [[hydronium ion]]s when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces [[hydroxide ion]]s when dissolved in water. According to [[Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory]], acids are substances that donate a positive [[hydrogen]] [[ion]] to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion. A third common theory is [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid-base theory]], which is based on the formation of new [[chemical bond]]s. Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond. According to concept as per Lewis, the crucial things being exchanged are charges.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm | title = The Lewis Acid-Base Concept | accessdate = 2010-07-31 | date = May 19, 2003 | work = Apsidium | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080527132328/http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm | archivedate = 2008-05-27}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2010}}<!-- A nicely layed-out and informative page on Lewis; unfortunately the apsidium.com web site was anonymous and thus not "reliable source" --> There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A708257 History of Acidity]</ref> Acid strength is commonly measured by two methods. One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is [[pH]], which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative [[logarithm]]ic scale. Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration, and can be
