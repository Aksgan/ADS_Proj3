continue up to the present day. Monism can be said to oppose religious philosophy altogether by claiming that the idea of spirituality contradicts the monist principle of an indistinguishable mind and body. ==Materialistic monism== Materialistic monism (or monistic [[materialism]]) is the philosophical [[concept]] which sees the [[unity]] of [[matter]] in its [[globality]]. For the materialistic monist the [[cosmos]] is “[[one]]” and comprehensive, then a “one-all” made up of parts such as its effects. The [[matter]] is then originary and cause of all [[reality]]. == See also == * [[Anomalous monism]] * [[Dialectical monism]] * [[Dualism]] * [[Eliminativism]] * [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]] * [[Holism]] * [[Indefinite monism]] * [[Mind-body problem]] * [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] * [[Monistic idealism]] * [[Neutral Monism]] * [[Non-Dualism]] * [[Ontological pluralism]] *[[Physical ontology]] * [[Cosmic pluralism|Pluralism]] * [[Reflexive monism]] == Notes == {{Refimprove|date=February 2009}} {{Reflist|2}} == External links == * [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10483a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] - Monism * [http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/lexicon/ Hinduism's Online Lexicon] - (search for Monism) * [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/monism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] - Monism * [http://secure.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/journal?openform&journal=pdc_monist The Monist] {{Navboxes |list= {{Theism}} {{Belief systems}} {{Philosophy topics}} {{metaphysics}} {{philosophy of mind}} {{philosophy of religion}} }} [[Category:Monism| ]] [[Category:Theology]] [[Category:Metaphysical theories]] [[Category:Theories of mind]] [[Category:Reductionism]] [[ar:واحدية]] [[az:Monizm]] [[bs:Monizam]] [[bg:Монизъм]] [[ca:Monisme]] [[cs:Monismus]] [[da:Monisme]] [[de:Monismus]] [[el:Μονισμός]] [[es:Monismo]] [[eo:Monismo]] [[fa:یگانه‌انگاری]] [[fr:Monisme]] [[ko:일원론]] [[hy:Մոնիզմ]] [[hr:Monizam]] [[io:Monismo]] [[id:Monisme]] [[is:Einhyggja]] [[it:Monismo]] [[he:מוניזם]] [[ka:მონიზმი]] [[lt:Monizmas]] [[hu:Monizmus]] [[mk:Монизам]] [[nl:Monisme (filosofie)]] [[ja:一元論]] [[no:Monisme]] [[oc:Monisme]] [[pl:Monizm]] [[pt:Monismo]] [[ro:Monism]] [[ru:Монизм]] [[simple:Monism]] [[sk:Monizmus (filozofia)]] [[sr:Монизам]] [[fi:Monismi]] [[sv:Monism]] [[tr:Monizm]] [[uk:Монізм]] [[vi:Thuyết nhất nguyên]] [[zh-yue:一元論]] [[zh:一元论]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25019</id> <title>Monochromatic color</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} '''Monochromatic colors''' are all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single [[hue]]. [[Image:Monocolour.jpg|frame|Example of Monochromatic color]] Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue, and extended using its shades, tones and tints (that is, a hue modified by the addition of black, gray (black + white) and white. As a result, the energy is more subtle and peaceful due to a lack of contrast of hue.

A monochrome bitmap is a rectangular grid of pixels, but each pixel is represented by a single bit. Eight pixels are in each byte of the bitmap.

If only a single variable <math>x</math> is considered this means that any monomial is either 1 or a power <math>x^n</math> of <math>x</math>, with <math>n</math> a positive integer. If several variables are considered, say, <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, <math>z</math>, then each can be given an exponent, so that any monomial is of the form <math>x^a y^b z^c</math> with <math>a,b,c</math> nonnegative integers (taking note that any exponent 0 makes the corresponding factor equal to 1). *The second meaning of monomial includes monomials in the first sense, but also allows multiplication by any constant, so that <math>-7x^5</math> and <math>(3-4i)x^4yz^{13}</math> are also considered to be monomials (the second example assuming polynomials in <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, <math>z</math> over the complex numbers are considered). == Comparison of the one definitions == With either definition, the set of monomials is a subset of all polynomials that is closed under multiplication. Both uses of this notion can be found, and in many cases the distinction is simply ignored, see for instance examples for the first<ref>{{cite book | last = Cox | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = John Little, Donal O'Shea | title = Using Algebraic Geometry | publisher = Springer Verlag | date = 1998 | location = | pages = 1 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-387-98487-9 }}</ref> and second<ref>{{Springer|id=M/m064760|title=Monomial}}</ref> meaning, and an [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Monomial.html unclear definition]. In informal discussions the distinction is seldom important, and tendency is towards the broader second meaning. When studying the structure of polynomials however, one often definitely needs a notion with the first meaning. This is for instance the case when considering a [[monomial basis]] of a [[polynomial ring]], or a [[monomial order]]ing of that basis. An argument in favor of the first meaning is also that no obvious other notion is available to designate these values (the term '''power product''' is in use, but it does not make the absence of constants clear either), while the notion ''term'' of a polynomial unambiguously coincides with the second meaning of monomial. For an isolated polynomial consisting of a single term, one could if necessary use the uncontracted form ''mononomial'', analogous to [[binomial]] and [[trinomial]]. ''The remainder of this article assumes the first meaning of "monomial".'' ==As bases== The most obvious fact about monomials is that any polynomial is a [[linear combination]] of them, so they can serve as [[basis vector]]s in a [[vector space]] of polynomials - a fact of constant implicit use in mathematics. ==Number== The number of monomials of degree ''d'' in ''n'' variables is the number of [[multicombination]]s of ''d'' elements chosen among the ''n'' variables (a variable can be chosen more than once, but order does not matter), which is given by the [[multiset coefficient]] <math>\textstyle{\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)}</math>. This expression can also be given in the form of a [[binomial coefficient]], as a [[polynomial expression]] in ''d'', or using a [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] of {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}: :<math>\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right) = \binom{n+d-1}{d} = \binom{d+(n-1)}{n-1} = \frac{(d+1)\times(d+2)\times\cdots\times(d+n-1)}{1\times2\times\cdots\times(n-1)} = \frac{1}{(n-1)!}(d+1)^{\overline{n-1}}.</math> The latter forms are particularly useful when one fixes the number of variables and lets the degree vary. From these expressions one sees that for fixed ''n'', the number of monomials of degree ''d'' is a polynomial expression in ''d'' of
