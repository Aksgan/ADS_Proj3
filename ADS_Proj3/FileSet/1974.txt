developed to reduce the manual labor of cleaning clothes, and [[water heater]]s reduced the labor necessary for [[bathing]]. Other traditional household tasks, like food preservation and preparation have been automated in large extent by [[Food processing|moving them into factory settings]], with the development of pre-made, [[convenience food|pre-packaged foods]], and in some countries, such as the United States, increased reliance on commercial food preparation services, such as [[fast food]] restaurants. Volume and the factory setting allows forms of automation that would be impractical or too costly in a home setting. Standardized foods enable possible further automation of handling the food within the home. The use of gaseous or liquid fuels, and later the use of electricity enabled increased automation in heating, reducing the labor necessary to fuel [[stove|heaters]] and [[kitchen stove|stove]]s. Development of [[thermostat]]s allowed more automated control of heating, and later cooling. A [[remote control]] for moving vessels and vehicles was first patented by [[Nikola Tesla]] in 1898.<ref name="tesla-tv">{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=0613809.PN.&OS=PN/0613809&RS=PN/0613809 |title=U.S. Patent 613809: Method of and apparatus for controlling mechanism of moving vessels and vehicles|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=1898-11-08 |accessdate=2010-06-16}}</ref> World's Fairs in Chicago (1934), New York (1939) and (1964–65)<ref name=Mann05>William C.

In 1966 Jim Sutherland, an engineer working for Westinghouse Electric, developed a home automation system called "ECHO IV"; this was a private project and never commercialized.<ref>http://www.drdobbs.com/184404040;jsessionid=IM5NJPJYWXAOFQE1GHPCKH4ATMY32JVN Dag Spicer, ''If You Can't Stand the Coding, Stay Out of the Kitchen'', ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'', August 2000 , retrieved 2010 Sept 2</ref> With the invention of the [[microcontroller]], the cost of electronic control fell rapidly. Remote and intelligent control technologies were adopted by the building services industry and appliance manufacturers worldwide, as they offer the end user easily accessible and/or greater control of their products. As the number of controllable appliances in the home rises, the ability of these devices to interconnect and communicate with each other digitally becomes a useful and desirable feature. The consolidation of control or monitoring signals from appliances, fittings or basic services is an aim of home automation. In simple installations this may be as straightforward as turning on the lights when a person enters the room. In advanced installations, rooms can sense not only the presence of a person inside but know who that person is and perhaps set appropriate lighting, temperature, music levels or television channels, taking into account the day of the week, the time of day, and other factors. Other automated tasks may include setting the [[air conditioning]] to an [[energy saving]] setting when the house is unoccupied, and restoring the normal setting when an occupant is about to return. More sophisticated systems can maintain an [[inventory]] of products, recording their usage through bar codes, or an [[RFID]] tag, and prepare a shopping list or even automatically order replacements. Home automation can also provide a remote interface to home appliances or the automation system itself, via telephone line, wireless transmission or the internet, to provide control and monitoring via a [[smart phone]] or [[web browser]]. An example of a remote monitoring in home automation could be when a smoke detector detects a fire or smoke condition, then all lights in the house will blink to alert any occupants of the house to the possible fire. If the house is equipped with a [[home cinema|home theatre]], a home automation system can shut down all audio and video components to avoid distractions, or make an audible announcement. The system could also call the home owner on their mobile phone to alert them, or call the fire department or alarm monitoring company. == System == {{prose|date=September 2010}} The elements of a domotics system are: * [[Programmable Logic Controller|hardware controllers]] or software controllers * [[sensors]] * [[actuators]] A centralized controller can be used, or multiple intelligent devices can be distributed around the home. === Interconnection === By wire: # [[optical fiber]] # cable ([[coaxial]] and [[twisted pair]]) <ref>"What’s that cable do?"> {{Cite web | url=http://smartestbuildings.blogspot.com/2010/09/whats-that-cable-do.html| title=What’s that cable do? | publisher=smartestbuildings | accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref> , including: #: [[xDSL]] # [[power line communication|powerline]], including: #: [[X10]] #: [[Universal powerline bus|Universal powerline bus (UPB)]] #: [[PLCBUS_(Communication_Protocol)|PLCBUS]] Wireless: # [[radio frequency]], including: #: [[Wi-Fi]] #: [[GPRS]] and [[UMTS]] #: [[Bluetooth]] #: [[DECT]] #: [[ZigBee]] #: [[Z-Wave]] #: [[X-Comfort]] #: [[ONE-NET]] #: [[EnOcean]] # [[infrared]], including: #: [[Consumer IR]] Both Wireless and Wire # [[INSTEON]] === Classifications of domestic network technologies === *Device interconnection: **[[Bluetooth]] **[[IEEE 1394 interface]] (FireWire) **[[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]] **[[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) **[[ZigBee]] *Control and automation nets: **[[Bus SCS|SCS BUS]] with [[OpenWebNet]] **[[C-Bus (protocol)]] **[[CEBus]] **[[EnOcean]] **[[European Home Systems Protocol|EHS]] **[[INSTEON]] **[[KNX (standard)|KNX]] (European Installation Bus) **[[LonWorks]] **[[ONE-NET]] **[[Universal powerline bus|Universal Powerline Bus]] **[[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] **[[ZigBee]] *Data nets: **[[Ethernet]] **[[HomePlug Powerline Alliance|Homeplug]] **[[HomePNA]] **[[WiFi]] There have been many attempts to standardise the forms of hardware, electronic and communication interfaces needed to construct a home automation system. Some standards use additional communication and control wiring, some embed signals in the existing [[Electric power transmission|power circuit]] of the house, some use [[Radio frequency|radio frequency (RF)]] signals, and some use a combination of several methods. Control wiring is hardest to retrofit into an existing house. Some appliances include USB that is used to control it and connect it to a domotics network. Bridges translate information from one standard to another, ''e.g.'', from X10 to European Installation Bus. ===Centralising control=== Besides the upcoming standardisation of home automation hardware, there is also the issue of the control software. In older systems (and some contemporary ones), the control of each home automation system needed to be done separately, and there was thus no central control system. This sometimes led to a great amount of remote controls, one being needed to control each individual part of the system. However, with the new generation of home automation systems, central control can be foreseen. Software such as [[Fast Track Team]] Home Personality Software Greeter 1.0 (aka
