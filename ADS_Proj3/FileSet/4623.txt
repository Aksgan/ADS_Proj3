C++ [[template (programming)|templates]], where <code>[[void return type|void]]</code> must be treated differently from other types. In C++ however, empty classes are allowed, so it is possible to implement a real unit type; the above example becomes compilable as: <source lang=cpp> class unit_type {}; const unit_type the_unit; unit_type f(unit_type) { return the_unit; } unit_type g(unit_type) { return the_unit; } int main() { f(g(the_unit)); return 0; } </source> (For brevity, we're not worried in the above example whether <code>the_unit</code> is really a [[singleton pattern|singleton]]; see [[singleton pattern]] for details on that issue.) ==== Difference in storage ==== The second notable difference is that the void type, being empty, can never be stored in a [[record type]], i.e. in a struct or a class in C/C++. In contrast, the unit type can be stored in records in functional programming languages, i.e. it can appear as the type of a field; the above implementation of the unit type in C++ can also be stored. While this may seem a useless feature, it does allow one for instance to elegantly implement a [[Set (computer science)|set]] as a [[Associative array|map]] to the unit type; in the absence of a unit type, one can still implement a set this way by storing some dummy value of another type for each key. ==== In Generics ==== In Java Generics, type parameters must be reference types. The wrapper type <code>Void</code> is often used when a unit type parameter is needed. Although the <code>Void</code> type can never have any instances, it does have one value, <code>null</code> (like all other reference types), so it acts as a unit type. In practice, any other non-instantiable type, e.g. <code>Math</code>, can also be used for this purpose, since they also have exactly one value, <code>null</code>. <source lang=java> public static Void f(Void x) { return null; } public static Void g(Void x) { return null; } public static void main(String[] args) { f(g(null)); } </source> ==References== * {{cite book |last=Pierce |first=Benjamin C. |authorlink=Benjamin C.

It followed in the footsteps of the [[World Economic Forum]] ([[WEF]]) Global Digital Divide Initiative (GDDI), and the Digital Opportunities Task Force (DOT Force), established in 2000 by the [[G8]] at their annual summit in [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]]. By providing it with a home in the United Nations, this accorded the UN ICT Task Force, in the eyes of many developing countries, a broader legitimization than the previous WEF and G8 initiatives, even if these previous initiatives also included a multi-stakehoder approach with broad participation by stakeholders from industrialized and developing countries. ==Aims and objectives== The Task Force's principal aim was to provide policy advice to governments and international organizations for bridging the digital divide. In addition to supporting the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) and leading the UN in developing ICT strategies for development, the Task Force's objective was to form partnerships between the UN system and states, private industry, trusts, foundations and donors, and other stakeholders. ==Membership and organization== The UN ICT Task Force<ref>[http://www.unicttaskforce.org/panel/ UN ICT Task Force membership]</ref> has included the top ranks of the computer industry ([[Cisco Systems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Nokia]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Sun Microsystems]]), together with global NGOs (e.g. the [[Association for Progressive Communications|APC]]), governments and international agencies. Its coordinating body was a multi-stakeholder bureau, assisted by a small secretariat at UN headquarters in New York. Technical advice was provided by a high-level panel of technical advisors. ==Activities== ===Challenge to Silicon Valley=== In November 2002 [[Kofi Annan]] issued a [[Challenge to Silicon Valley]] to create suitable systems at prices low enough to permit deployment everywhere, whether through international aid programs, [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, charities, or [[microcredit]] support. The call has been answered, but only a few [[UN]] programs were actively using computers and communications in developing countries in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The [[UNHCR]] ran a refugee camp in [[Tanzania]] where the [http://www.global-catalyst.org/resources_online.htm Global Catalyst Foundation] had placed computers and communications equipment for the use of the Burundian refugees confined there. The [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] worked with the kingdom of [[Bhutan]] on a [[Simputer]] project. ===World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)=== The Task Force was active, inter alia, in the process leading to the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] ([[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]]) in [[Geneva]] in December 2003 and WSIS II in [[Tunis]] in November 2005. In order to participate in the second phase of the WSIS, the Task Force's original 3-year mandate was extended by another year and expired on 31 December 2005, with no further extension. ===Working groups=== The Task Force's stakeholders, members and the experts on the panel of technical advisors, were active in working groups organized around four broad themes: * ICT Policy and Governance * Enabling Environment * Human Resource Development and Capacity Building * ICT Indicators and MDG Mapping ===Regional networks=== Regional activities were carried out in five regional networks: * Africa * Latin America and the Caribbean * Asia * Arab States * Europe and Central Asia ===Meetings=== 2002, June 17-18: A session of
