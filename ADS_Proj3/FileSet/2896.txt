He is (with [[Franco P. Preparata]]) the author of ''Computational Geometry'' (Springer-Verlag, 1985), which was for many years the standard textbook in [[computational geometry]], and is known for the Shamos–Hoey [[sweep line algorithm]] for line segment intersection detection and for the [[rotating calipers]] technique for finding the width and [[diameter]] of a geometric figure. His publications also include works on [[electronic voting]], the game of [[billiards]], and [[intellectual property]] law in the digital age. He was a [[fellow]] of [[Sigma Xi]] (1974–83), had an IBM Fellowship at [[Yale University]] (1974–75), was [[SIAM]] National Lecturer (1977–78), distinguished lecturer in computer science at the [[University of Rochester]] (1978), visited [[McGill University]] (1979), and belonged to the [[Duquesne University]] Law Review (1980–81). He won the first annual Black & White Scotch Achiever’s Award in 1991 for contributions to bagpipe musicography, and the Industry Service Award of the Billiard and Bowling Institute of America, 1996, for contributions to billiard history. Since 2001 he is a Billiard Worldcup Association official referee. He has been editor in chief of the ''Journal of Privacy Technology'' (2003–2006), a member of the editorial boards of ''Electronic Commerce Research Journal'' and the ''Pittsburgh Journal of Technology, Law and Policy'', and a contributing editor of ''Billiards Digest'' magazine.
