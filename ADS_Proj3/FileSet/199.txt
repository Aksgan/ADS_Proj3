a ''good'' state when measured is <math>a^2</math>. Furthermore we have <math>a^2+b^2=1</math>. Define a unitary operator <math>Q(\psi, \chi) := -S_\psi S_\chi \,\!</math>, where :<math> \begin{align} S_\psi &= I - 2|\psi\rangle \langle\psi|\quad \text{and}\\ S_\chi |x\rangle &= (-1)^{\chi(x)} |x\rangle. \end{align} </math> The action of this operator on <math>\mathcal{H}_\psi</math> is given by :<math>Q |\psi_0\rangle = -S_\psi |\psi_0\rangle = (1-2a^2)|\psi_0\rangle +2ab|\psi_1\rangle</math> and :<math>Q |\psi_1\rangle = S_\psi |\psi_1\rangle = -2ab|\psi_0\rangle +(1-2a^2)|\psi_1\rangle</math>. By defining <math>\theta := \arcsin(a) \,\!</math>, <math>0 < \theta < \pi/2 \,\!</math>, we can clearly see that in this subspace <math>Q</math> corresponds to a rotation by the angle <math>2\theta\,\!</math>: :<math>Q = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(2\theta) & \sin(2\theta)\\ -\sin(2\theta) & \cos(2\theta) \end{pmatrix}</math>. <!-- Outside <math>\mathcal{H}_\psi</math> the operator <math>Q</math> acts simply as <math>-S_\chi</math>...--> Applying <math>Q(\psi, \chi)\,\!</math> repeatedly on the state <math>|\psi\rangle</math> gives :<math>Q^n |\psi\rangle = \cos((2n+1) \theta) |\psi_0\rangle +\sin((2n+1)\theta) |\psi_1\rangle</math>, rotating the state between the ''good'' and ''bad'' subspaces. After <math>n</math> iterations the probability of finding the system in a ''good'' state is <math>\sin^2((2n+1)\theta)\,\!</math>.<br/> The probability is maximized if we choose :<math>n = \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4\theta}\right\rfloor</math>. Up until this point each iteration increases the amplitude of the ''good'' states, hence the name of the technique. == Applications == Assume we have an unsorted database with N elements, and an oracle function <math>\chi</math> which can recognize the ''good'' entries we are searching for. If there are G such entries in the database in total, then we can find them by initializing the quantum computer into a uniform superposition :<math>|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |k\rangle</math> of all the database elements, and running the above algorithm. In this case the overlap of the initial state with the ''good'' subspace is equal to the frequency of the ''good'' entries in the database, <math>a^2 = G/N</math>. If <math>a \ll 1</math>, we can approximate the number of required iterations as :<math>n = \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4\theta}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4 \arcsin(a)}\right\rfloor \approx \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4 a}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{N}{G}}\right\rfloor = O(\sqrt{N}). </math> Measuring the state will now give one of the ''good'' entries with a high probability. Since each iteration requires a single oracle query, we can find a ''good'' entry with just <math>O(\sqrt{N})</math> oracle queries, thus obtaining a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm. If we set G to one, the above scenario essentially reduces to the original Grover search. == References == {{reflist}} {{Quantum computing}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Amplitude Amplification}} [[Category:Quantum algorithms]] [[Category:Search algorithms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1764</id> <title>Amy Hennig</title> <text>{{ infobox writer | name = Amy Hennig | image = | imagesize = | alt = | caption = | birthdate = {{Birth based on age as of date|45|2010|2|26}} | birthplace = | occupation = Video game writer and [[video game director|director]] | language = English | nationality = [[United States|American]] | alma_mater = [[University of California, Berkeley]] | notableworks = ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' series; ''[[Uncharted]]'' series | influences = | influenced = | awards = [[Writers Guild of America Award|Writers Guild of America Video Game Writing Award]] nomination | signature = | signature_alt = | website = | portaldisp = }} '''Amy Hennig''' (born 1964/65)<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi7-2010feb07,0,7109862.story|title=How I Made It: Amy Hennig|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=7 February 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref> is a video game director and [[screenwriter|script writer]] currently employed by video game company [[Naughty Dog]]. She began her work in the industry on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], making her design debut with ''[[Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City]]''. She soon went to work for [[Crystal Dynamics]], working primarily on the ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' series. With Naughty Dog, her work has been on two primary series: the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series and the ''[[Uncharted]]'' series. With her writing style, Hennig believes that the creative direction of a script holds more importance than the graphics of the game. She has been called one of the most influential women in the [[video game industry]] by ''[[Edge magazine]]'', and has been cited as an example of how more women are becoming involved in a previously male dominated field. ==Life== Three events in Hennig's life greatly influenced her later work; all happened in 1977. The release of the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' changed how games and entertainment in general would be developed.<ref name=LATimes/> Hennig graduated from [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[English literature]].<ref name=LATimes/> She went on to the film school at [[San Francisco State University]], when she was hired as an artist for an [[Atari]] game called [[ElectroCop]].<ref name=LATimes/> Her work on the game made her realize that the video game industry interested her more than the [[film industry]]; she dropped out of film school soon after.<ref name=LATimes/> Hennig claims that her literature degree and film studies have helped her work: "Everything I learned as an undergraduate with English literature and in film school about editing and shots and the language of film has come into play, but in a way I couldn't possibly have planned."<ref name=LATimes/> ==Career== Hennig has worked in the [[video game industry]] for more than 17 years.<ref name=GSW>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/08/20-week/|title=Game Mag Weaselingâ€™: Mag Roundup 8/26/06|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|date=26 August 2006|publisher=GameSetWatch.
