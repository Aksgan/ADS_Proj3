''e'' ≤ ''s'', for some ''s'' in ''S'', then ''s'' is in ''E''.<ref>Lawson 1998 : Proposition 2.4.3.</ref> '''Theorem.''' Let ''S'' be an inverse semigroup with [[semilattice]] ''E'' of idempotents, and minimum group congruence σ. Then the following are equivalent:<ref>Lawson 1998 : Theorem 2.4.6.</ref> *''S'' is ''E''-unitary; *σ is idempotent pure; *<math>\sim</math> = σ, where <math>\sim</math> is the ''compatibility relation'' on ''S'', defined by :<math>a\sim b\Longleftrightarrow ab^{-1},a^{-1}b</math> are idempotent. '''McAlister's Covering Theorem.''' Every inverse semigroup S has a E-unitary cover; that is there exists an idempotent separating surjective homorphism from some E-unitary semigroup T onto S.<ref>Grillet p. 248</ref> Central to the study of ''E''-unitary inverse semigroups is the following construction.<ref>Howie 1995 : 193&ndash;4</ref> Let <math>\mathcal{X}</math> be a [[partially ordered set]], with ordering ≤, and let <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> be a [[subset]] of <math>\mathcal{X}</math> with the properties that *<math>\mathcal{Y}</math> is a [[semilattice|lower semilattice]], that is, every pair of elements ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> has a [[greatest lower bound]] ''A'' <math>\wedge</math> ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> (with respect to ≤); *<math>\mathcal{Y}</math> is an [[order ideal]] of <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, that is, for ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, if ''A'' is in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> and ''B'' ≤ ''A'', then ''B'' is in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math>. Now let ''G'' be a [[group (mathematics)|group]] which [[group action|acts]] on <math>\mathcal{X}</math> (on the left), such that *for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, ''gA'' = ''gB'' if, and only if, ''A'' = ''B''; *for each ''g'' in ''G'' and each ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, there exists an ''A'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math> such that ''gA'' = ''B''; *for all ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, ''A'' ≤ ''B'' if, and only if, ''gA'' ≤ ''gB''; *for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''A'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, ''g''(''hA'') = (''gh'')''A''. The triple <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is also assumed to have the following properties: *for every ''X'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' and an ''A'' in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> such that ''gA'' = ''X''; *for all ''g'' in ''G'', ''g''<math>\mathcal{Y}</math> and <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> have nonempty intersection. Such a triple <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is called a ''McAlister triple''. A McAlister triple is used to define the following: :<math>P(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}) = \{ (A,g) \in \mathcal{Y}\times G: g^{-1}A \in \mathcal{Y} \}</math> together with multiplication :<math>(A,g)(B,h)=(A \wedge gB, gh)</math>. Then <math>P(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is an inverse semigroup under this multiplication, with (''A'',''g'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> = (''g''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''A'', ''g''<sup>&minus;1</sup>). One of the main results in the study of ''E''-unitary inverse semigroups is ''McAlister's P-Theorem'': '''McAlister's P-Theorem.''' Let <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> be a McAlister triple. Then <math>P(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is an ''E''-unitary inverse semigroup. Conversely, every ''E''-unitary inverse semigroup is [[isomorphic]] to one of this type.<ref>Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.9.2. Originally, McAlister 1974a,b.</ref> === ''F''-inverse semigroups === An inverse semigroup is said to be ''F''-inverse if every element has a ''unique'' maximal element above it in the natural partial order, i.e. ever σ-class has a maximal element. Every ''F''-inverse semigroup is an ''E''-unitary monoid. McAlister's covering theorem has been refined by [[M.V. Lawson]] to: '''Theorem.''' Every inverse semigroup has an ''F''-inverse cover.<ref>Lawson 1998 p. 230</ref> McAlister's ''P''-theorem has been used to characterize ''F''-inverse semigroups as well. A McAlister triple <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is an ''F''-inverse semigroups if and only if <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> is a principal ideal of <math>\mathcal{X}</math> and <math>\mathcal{X}</math> is a semilattice. == Free inverse semigroups == A construction similar to a [[free group]] is possible for inverse semigroups. A [[presentation]] of the free inverse semigroup on a set ''X'' may be obtained by considering the [[free semigroup with involution]], where involution is the taking of the inverse, and then [[Semigroup#Homomorphisms and congruences|taking the quotient]] by the '''Vagner congruence''' :<math>\{ (xx^{-1}x, x),\; (xx^{-1}yy^{-1}, yy^{-1}xx^{-1})\;|\;x,y \in (X\cup X^{-1})^+ \}. </math> The [[word problem]] for free inverse semigroups is much more intricate than that of free groups. A celebrated result in this area due to [[W. D. Munn]] who showed that elements of the free inverse semigroup can be naturally regarded as trees, known as Munn trees. Multiplication in the free inverse semigroup has a correspondent on [[Munn tree]]s, which essentially consists of overlapping common portions of the trees. (see Lawson 1998 for further details) <!-- can't say much more without getting into way more details--> Any free inverse semigroup is ''F''-inverse.<ref>Lawson 1998, p.230</ref> == Connections with category theory == The above composition of partial transformations of a set gives rise to a symmetric inverse semigroup. There is another way of composing partial transformations, which is more restrictive than that used above: two partial transformations α and β are composed if, and only if, the image of α is equal to the domain of β; otherwise, the composition αβ is undefined. Under this alternative composition, the collection of all partial one-one transformations of a set forms not an inverse semigroup but an [[inductive groupoid]], in the sense of [[category theory]]. This close connection between inverse semigroups and inductive groupoids is embodied in the ''Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad Theorem'', which states that an inductive groupoid can always be constructed from an inverse semigroup, and conversely.<ref>Lawson 1998 : 4.1.8.</ref> == Generalisations of inverse semigroups == As noted above, an inverse semigroup ''S'' can be defined by the conditions (1) ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]], and (2) the [[idempotent]]s in ''S'' commute; this has led to two distinct classes of generalisations of an inverse semigroup: semigroups in which (1) holds, but (2) does not, and vice versa. Examples of regular generalisations of an inverse semigroup are:<ref>Howie 1995 : Section 2.4 & Chapter 6.</ref> *''[[Regular semigroup]]s'': a [[semigroup]] ''S'' is ''regular'' if every element has at least one inverse; equivalently, for each ''a'' in ''S'', there is an ''x'' in ''S'' such that ''axa'' = ''a''. *''Locally inverse semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is ''locally inverse'' if ''eSe'' is an inverse semigroup, for each [[idempotent]] ''e''. *''Orthodox semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is ''orthodox'' if its subset of [[idempotent]]s forms a subsemigroup. *''Generalised inverse semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is called a ''generalised inverse semigroup'' if its [[idempotent]]s form a normal band, i.e., ''xyzx'' = ''xzyx'', for all [[idempotent]]s ''x'', ''y'', ''z''.
