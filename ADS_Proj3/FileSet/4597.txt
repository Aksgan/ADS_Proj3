After almost a year of development, on October 29, 2005, the world saw the Russian version of the system. In June 2007, the English version was officially presented, and in August — the German one. At present uCoz is also available in Spanish, French, Arabic, Hungarian, Swedish, and partially in Latvian, Ukrainian, Georgian. ==Modules== uCoz CMS platform includes modules that can be used to create a fully customized site, alternatively, some modules can be used separately to create a blog, a forum etc. ==Peculiarities== Being a [[SaaS]] system, uCoz has [[SaaS]] features — closed source code, unavailability of running of server-side scripts and databases (all this is possible within Web 3.0 [[PaaS]] concept), which is balanced out by a great number of [http://www.ucoz.com/main/?a=about built-in system capabilities].

The resulting digest or fingerprint is then encrypted to hide the identity of the hash function used. As with any MAC, it may be used to simultaneously verify both the ''[[data integrity]]'' and the ''authenticity'' of a [[message]]. A UMAC has provable cryptographic strength and is usually a lot less computationally intensive than other MACs. ==Universal hashing== Let's say the hash function is chosen from a class of hash functions H, which maps messages into D, the set of possible message digests. This class is called [[Universal hashing|universal]] if, for any distinct pair of messages, there are at most |H|/|D| functions that map them to the same member of D. This means that if an attacker wants to replace one message with another and, from his point of view the hash function was chosen completely randomly, the probability that the UMAC
