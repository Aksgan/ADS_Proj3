range of dates, print off data based on the observations and (in some versions) control a telescope. It uses data from the [[Hubble]] Guide Star Catalog II. Began in the early 1990's, the current version is 7.0 (released in 2009) which includes 3D models of the galaxy, multimedia tours and access to star catalogs. Platforms include Windows (7/Vista/XP), iPhone and iPad, PC editions include Premium (with a library of 100 million objects and telescope control) and Compact (fewer objects in the libarary, no telescope interface). All version support Redshift-Live links - an online site to share observation information and other astronomy pictures and data. == See also == *[[Cartes du Ciel]] *[[Celestia]] *[[Digital Universe Atlas]] *[[Google Mars]] *[[Google Moon]] *[[Google Sky]] *[[HNSKY|Hallo Northern Sky (HN Sky)]] *[[KStars]] *[[Starry Night (planetarium software)|Starry Night]] *[[Stellarium (computer program)|Stellarium]] *[[Universe Sandbox]] *[[Worldwide Telescope]] *[[XEphem]] ==External links== * [http://www.redshift-live.com/index.php/en/ RedShift live] [[Category:Planetaria| software - RedShift]] [[Category:Astronomy software]] {{software stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>31567</id> <title>Redalyc</title> <text>The '''Red de Revistas Científicas de América Latina y El Caribe, España y Portugal (Redalyc)''' project started in January 2003 with the general aim of building a scientific information system made up by the leading journals of all the knowledge areas edited in and about [[Latin America]]. Now days, Redalyc is an information system that also evaluates the scientific and editorial quality of knowledge in [[Ibero-America]]. A research group generates bibliometric indicators about the impact of the journals, authors and countries included in the journal electronic library. Redalyc has been consolidated as an important [[repository]] of knowledge with 550 journals online and more than 116 000 full-text articles. Since its creation Redalyc set a goal: to give visibility to the scientific production generated in [[Ibero-America]], that is underestimated in the world-wide scene due to different factors like low investment in [[science]] and [[technology]], the low participation of [[Latin American]] scientists in the ''main current of science'', measured by the percentage of articles signed by Latin American authors in main databases and the low impact of that production.[http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/ojs/pubs/article/view/856/852] The main communication vehicle of academic and scientific means is the publication in [[scientific journals]]. In this sense, the Latin American participation of authors or institutions in principal journals or the impact of journals produced in the region allows to know the effect of Latin American science in the world. According to Ricyt (2002), the participation of the Latin American scientists in “the main current of science”, measured by the percentage of articles signed by authors of Latin America in the main databases that register scientific publications was practically null, less than 3% in the important repositories, although there was a growing, for example, 2,7% in the [[Science Citation Index]] (SCI). [http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/ojs/pubs/article/view/856/852] Redalyc is an effort working under [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]] supported by the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México [http://www.uaemex.mx] with the help of hundreds superior education institutions and information systems. Using the slogan, La ciencia que no se ve no existe (Science that is not seen does not exist) Redalyc has taken a giant step forward in providing access to academic [[research]] produced in Latin America. It is anticipated that the visibility of the full text of these journals will increase the citation rates and gobal research impact of Latin American scholarship.

Similarly to parallel projects such as [[Latindex]], Redalyc fully embraces the [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]] policy and its material is released under a [[Creative Commons]] license, with free download. Along with a keyword search on each page, users can browse the catalogue by title, author, country or subject and they also submit original papers in .doc, .rtf or .odt formats,to be included in a specific journal.

Bibliometric techniques have been shown to be useful in development of indicators of scientific research activity to address emerging concerns such as institutional level analysis of capabilities and networks (Katz and Hicks, 1997). Bibliometric indicators have been used for policy purposes for nearly 25 years (Narin, 1976) and were developed to address central concerns of classical science policy - level of research output and its impact. In this sense they have been so useful that they are incorporated in regular statistical series such as the National Science Foundation's (NSF) science indicators and are used in high profile analyses by leading scientists and policy makers.[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/sylvank/pubs/ESRC.pdf] == Socio-scientific networks == Authors collaboration networks * Area: Map showing authors collaboration in a particular knowledge area * Journal: Map showing authors collaboration in a journal * Institution: Map showing authors collaboration in an institution * Country: Map showing authors collaboration in a country * Author: Map showing an author's collaboration network * Area: Map showing authors collaboration in the public administration area == Grouping of journals == {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} == Usage indicators == Redalyc produces indicator to keep track of the publications consultation, we Consider that the scientific communication
