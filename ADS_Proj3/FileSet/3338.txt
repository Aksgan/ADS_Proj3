to reinforce, punish, or extinguish behavior and are not always delivered by people. * '''[[Reinforcement]]''' is a consequence that causes a behavior to occur with greater frequency. * '''[[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]''' is a consequence that causes a behavior to occur with less frequency. * '''[[extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]''' is the lack of any consequence following a behavior. When a behavior is inconsequential, producing neither favorable nor unfavorable consequences, it will occur with less frequency. When a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement, it leads to a decline in the response. ===Four contexts of operant conditioning=== Here the terms ''positive'' and ''negative'' are not used in their [[popular culture|popular sense]], but rather: ''positive'' refers to addition, and ''negative'' refers to subtraction. What is added or subtracted may be either reinforcement or punishment. Hence ''positive punishment'' is sometimes a confusing term, as it denotes the "addition" of a stimulus or increase in the intensity of a stimulus that is aversive (such as spanking or an electric shock). The four procedures are: # '''Positive reinforcement''' (Reinforcement): occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by a stimulus that is appetitive or [[reward system|rewarding]], increasing the frequency of that behavior. In the [[Skinner box]] experiment, a stimulus such as food or sugar solution can be delivered when the rat engages in a target behavior, such as pressing a lever. # '''Negative reinforcement''' (Escape): occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of an [[aversive]] stimulus, thereby increasing that behavior's frequency. In the Skinner box experiment, negative reinforcement can be a loud noise continuously sounding inside the rat's cage until it engages in the target behavior, such as pressing a lever, upon which the loud noise is removed. # '''Positive punishment''' (Punishment) (also called "Punishment by contingent stimulation"): occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by a stimulus, such as introducing a shock or loud noise, resulting in a decrease in that behavior. # '''Negative punishment''' (Penalty) (also called "Punishment by contingent withdrawal"): occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of a stimulus, such as taking away a child's toy following an undesired behavior, resulting in a decrease in that behavior. ''Also:'' * '''Avoidance learning''' is a type of learning in which a certain behavior results in the cessation of an aversive stimulus. For example, performing the behavior of shielding one's eyes when in the sunlight (or going indoors) will help avoid the aversive stimulation of having light in one's eyes. * '''Extinction''' occurs when a behavior (response) that had previously been reinforced is no longer effective. In the Skinner box experiment, this is the rat pushing the lever and being rewarded with a food pellet several times, and then pushing the lever again and never receiving a food pellet again. Eventually the rat would cease pushing the lever. * '''Noncontingent reinforcement''' refers to delivery of reinforcing stimuli regardless of the organism's (aberrant) behavior. The idea is that the target behavior decreases because it is no longer necessary to receive the reinforcement. This typically entails time-based delivery of stimuli identified as maintaining aberrant behavior, which serves to decrease the rate of the target behavior.<ref>Tucker, M., Sigafoos, J., & Bushell, H. (1998). Use of noncontingent reinforcement in the treatment of challenging behavior. Behavior Modification, 22, 529–547.</ref> As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent "reinforcement".<ref>Poling, A., & Normand, M. (1999). Noncontingent reinforcement: an inappropriate description of time-based schedules that reduce behavior.

Thorndike]] (1874–1949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes.<ref>Thorndike, E.L. (1901). Animal intelligence: An experimental study of the associative processes in animals. Psychological Review Monograph Supplement, 2, 1–109.</ref> When first constrained in the boxes, the cats took a long time to escape. With experience, ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, enabling the cats to escape in less time over successive trials. In his [[law of effect]], Thorndike theorized that successful responses, those producing ''satisfying'' consequences, were "stamped in" by the experience and thus occurred more frequently. Unsuccessful responses, those producing ''annoying'' consequences, were ''stamped out'' and subsequently occurred less frequently. In short, some consequences ''strengthened'' behavior and some consequences ''weakened'' behavior. Thorndike produced the first known learning curves through this procedure. [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) formulated a more detailed analysis of operant conditioning based on reinforcement, punishment, and extinction. Following the ideas of [[Ernst Mach]], Skinner rejected Thorndike's mediating structures required by "satisfaction" and constructed a new conceptualization of behavior without any such references. So, while experimenting with some homemade feeding mechanisms, Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]] which allowed him to measure rate of response as a key dependent variable using a cumulative record of lever presses or key pecks.<ref>Mecca Chiesa (2004) Radical Behaviorism: the philosophy and the science</ref> ==Biological correlates of operant conditioning== The first scientific studies identifying [[neuron]]s that responded in ways that suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by [[Mahlon deLong]]<ref>[http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/citation/34/3/414 "Activity of pallidal neurons during movement"], M.R.
