The problem asks, for a particular class of [[finitely presented group]]s if there exists an algorithm that, given a finite presentation of a group from the class, computes the rank of that group. The rank problem is one of the harder algorithmic problems studied in group theory and relatively little is known about it. Known results include: *The rank problem is algorithmically undecidable for the class of all [[finitely presented group]]s. Indeed, by a classical result of Adian-Rabin, there is no algorithm to decide if a finitely presented group is trivial, so even the question of whether rank(''G'')=0 is undecidable for finitely presented groups.<ref>W.

There is a dual notion of '''co-rank''' of a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' defined as the ''largest'' [[cardinality]] of ''X'' such that there exists an onto [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] ''G'' → ''F''(''X'').
