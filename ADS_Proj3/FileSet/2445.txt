and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the [[Kronecker product]] can be [[Kronecker_product#Spectrum|explicitly calculated]]. Based on this, [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]] can also be explicitly calculated. The [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the standard [[Central_difference#Higher-order_differences|central difference approximation of the second derivative]] on an interval for traditional combinations of boundary conditions at the interval end points are [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative|well known]]. Combining these expressions with the formulas of [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] for the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]], one can easily obtain the required answer. ===Example: 3D [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]] with the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]=== :<math>L = \mathbf{D_{xx}}\otimes\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{D_{yy}}\otimes\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{D_{zz}}, \,</math> where <math>\mathbf{D_{xx}},\,\mathbf{D_{yy}}</math> and <math>\mathbf{D_{zz}} </math> are 1D discrete Laplacians in every of the 3 directions, and <math>\mathbf{I} </math> are the identities of appropriate sizes. Each 1D discrete Laplacian must correspond to the case of the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]], in order to generate the 3D discrete Laplacian ''L'' corresponding to the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] everywhere on the boundary. The eigenvalues are :<math> \lambda_{jx,jy,jz} = -\frac{4}{h_x^2} \sin(\frac{\pi j_x}{2(n_x + 1)})^2 -\frac{4}{h_y^2} \sin(\frac{\pi j_y}{2(n_y + 1)})^2 -\frac{4}{h_z^2} \sin(\frac{\pi j_z}{2(n_z + 1)})^2 </math> where <math> j_x=1,\ldots,n_x,\,j_y=1,\ldots,n_y,\,j_z=1,\ldots,n_z,\,</math>, and the corresponding eigenvectors are :<math>v_{ix,iy,iz,jx,jy,jz} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{n_x+1}} \sin(\frac{i_x j_x \pi}{n_x+1}) \sqrt{\frac{2}{n_y+1}} \sin(\frac{i_y j_y \pi}{n_y+1}) \sqrt{\frac{2}{n_z+1}} \sin(\frac{i_z j_z \pi}{n_z+1}) </math> where the multi-index <math>{jx,jy,jz}</math> pairs the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors, while the multi-index <math>{ix,iy,iz}</math> determines the location of the value of every eigenvector at the [[regular grid]]. The boundary points, where the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] are imposed, are just outside of the grid. ==Available software== An [[OCTAVE]]/[[MATLAB]] code http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27279-laplacian-in-1d-2d-or-3d is available under a [[BSD License]], which computes the sparse matrix of the 1, 2D, and 3D negative Laplacians on a rectangular grid for combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Periodic boundary conditions using [[Kronecker sum]]s of discrete 1D Laplacians. The code also provides the exact [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s using the explicit formulas given above.

Starting with a vector, ''b'', one computes <math>A b</math>, then one multiplies that vector by ''A'' to find <math>A^2 b</math> and so on. All algorithms that work this way are referred to as Krylov subspace methods; they are among the most successful methods currently available in numerical linear algebra. Because the vectors tend very quickly to become almost [[linear independence|linearly dependent]], methods relying on Krylov subspace frequently involve some [[orthogonalization]] scheme, such as [[Lanczos iteration]] for [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] or [[Arnoldi iteration]] for more general matrices. The best known Krylov subspace methods are the [[Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi]], [[Lanczos iteration|Lanczos]], [[Conjugate gradient]], [[GMRES]] (generalized minimum residual), [[BiCGSTAB]] (biconjugate gradient stabilized), QMR (quasi minimal residual), TFQMR (transpose-free QMR), and MINRES (minimal residual) methods. ==References== * {{cite book|last=Nevanlinna|first=Olavi|title=Convergence of iterations for linear equations|series=Lectures in Mathematics ETH Zürich|publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag|location=Basel|year=1993|pages=viii+177 pp.|isbn=3-7643-2865-7| id={{MR|1217705}}|}} * {{cite book | first=Yousef | last=Saad | authorlink=Yousef Saad |title=Iterative methods for sparse linear systems | edition=2nd| year=2003 | publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] | isbn=0898715342 | oclc=51266114 }} <references/> {{math-stub}} {{Numerical linear algebra}} [[Category:Numerical linear algebra]] [[Category:Invariant subspaces]] [[Category:Operator theory]] [[de:Krylowraum]] [[es:Subespacio de Krylov]] [[ja:クリロフ部分空間]] [[pl:Przestrzeń Kryłowa]] [[ru:Подпространство Крылова]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20857</id> <title>Kryptos</title> <text>{{about|the sculpture|other uses|Kryptos (disambiguation)}} [[Image:Kryptos01 1.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|''Kryptos'' at CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]]]] '''''Kryptos''''' is a [[sculpture]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Jim Sanborn]] located on the grounds of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]], [[Virginia]]. Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the [[cryptography|encrypted]] messages it bears. Of the four sections, three have been solved, with the fourth remaining one of the most famous [[unsolved codes]] in the world. The sculpture continues to provide a diversion for some employees of the CIA and other [[cryptanalyst]]s attempting to decrypt the messages. == Description == The main sculpture is made of red and green [[slate]], white [[quartz]], [[petrified wood]], [[lodestone]], and [[copper]], and is located in the northwest corner of the New Headquarters Building courtyard, outside of the Agency cafeteria. The name ''Kryptos'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word for "hidden", and the theme of the sculpture is "intelligence gathering." The most prominent feature is a large vertical S-shaped copper screen resembling a scroll, or piece of paper emerging from a computer printer, covered with characters comprising encrypted text. The characters consist of the 26 letters of the standard Roman alphabet and question marks cut out of the copper. This "inscription" contains four separate enigmatic messages, three of which have been solved.<ref name=secrets/> At the same time as the main sculpture was installed, sculptor [[Jim Sanborn|Sanborn]] also placed several other pieces around [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] grounds, such as several large granite slabs with sandwiched copper sheets outside the entrance to the New Headquarters Building. Several [[morse code]] messages are engraved in the copper, and one of the slabs has an engraved [[compass rose]]. Other elements of Sanborn's installation include a landscaped area, a duck pond, and several other seemingly unmarked slabs. The cost of the sculpture was $250,000.<ref name="FAQ"/> == Encrypted messages == The ciphertext on one half of the main sculpture contains 869 characters in total — in April 2006, however, Sanborn released information stating that an intended letter on the main half of ''Kryptos'' was missing. This would bring the total number of characters to 870 on the main portion.
