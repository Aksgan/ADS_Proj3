For more than ten years it has been written and maintained by Mark Hessling, who along with being the original author of THE is also a maintainer of Regina, an open source [[REXX]] interpreter that has been ported to most Unix platforms. THE is a [[text editor]] modeled on the VM/CMS editor [[XEDIT]], adding the best features of Mansfield Software's Kedit. Among the key features of the editor: * availability of folding which can be controlled in various sophisticated ways (keyword based, indent based, etc.). * the use of REXX as macro language. Folding is controlled by the "all" command. It permits to display and work on only those lines in a file that contain a given pattern. For example, the command: all /string/ will display only the lines that include "string"; any global changes you make on this slice (for example replace string command) will be reflected in the file. (In most cases this is a more convenient way to make global changes in the file.) In order to restore visibility of all lines you need to enter: all (without a target string). Similar to [[XEDIT]], THE uses [[IBM]]s [[REXX]] as its macro language, which makes THE highly configurable and versatile. This provides the ability to create powerful extensions to the editor and/or customize it to specialized needs. For example, you could create edit commands that would allow you to manipulate columns of text (e.g. copy/move or insert/delete a column of text within a file). With REXX, you can also integrate OS commands or external functions into an edit session. Since version 3.0, THE also has user-configurable syntax highlighting. THE is [[free software]], distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. It is available for many operating systems: most or all [[POSIX]] [[Unix]] platforms (as a program for text-mode or native [[X Window System|X11]]); [[QNX]], [[OS/2]], [[DOS]], [[BeOS]], [[Amiga]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP. ==External links== *[http://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/ THE: The Hessling Editor] *[http://www.gut-wirtz.de/THE/index.html Supporting stuff for The Hessling Editor] {{DEFAULTSORT:Hessling Editor, The}} [[Category:Free text editors]] [[Category:Curses (programming library)]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C]] {{Unix-stub}} {{Windows-software-stub}} [[fr:The Hessling Editor]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37347</id> <title>The Island of Dr. Brain</title> <text>{{Infobox VG |title = |image = [[Image:The Island of Dr. Brain Coverart.png|252px]] |developer = [[Sierra Online]] |publisher = [[Sierra Online]] |designer = |engine = |version = |released = {{vgy|1992}} |genre = [[Educational game|Educational]], [[Computer puzzle game|Puzzle]] |modes = [[Single-player]] |platforms = [[DOS]] |media = [[Floppy disk]], [[CD-ROM]] |input = [[Mouse (computing)|Mouse]] }} '''''The Island of Dr. Brain''''' is the second game in the [[Dr. Brain]] series by [[Sierra Online]].

The game's story starts with an explanation by Dr. Brain. He tells the player that plans for his latest project were stolen, and he charges the player to retrieve a battery from his island and bring it to him. The player must then traverse the security puzzles Dr. Brain has set up throughout his island.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/224/Island+of+Dr.+Brain,+The.html |
