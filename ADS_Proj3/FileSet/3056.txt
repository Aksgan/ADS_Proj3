[[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] aimed to gather together all the world's [[knowledge]] and classify it according to a system they developed called the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations which caused the creation of the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA). Otlet regarded the project as the centerpiece of a new 'world city'—a centrepiece which eventually became an [[archive]] with more than 12 million [[index card]]s and documents. Some consider it a forerunner of the [[internet]] (or, perhaps more appropriately, of [[Wikipedia]]) and Otlet himself had dreams that one day, somehow, all the information he collected could be accessed by people from the comfort of their own homes. The Mundaneum was originally housed at the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Palais du Cinquantenaire]] in [[Brussels]] (Belgium). The Mundaneum has since been relocated to a converted 1930s department store in [[Mons]] ([[Wallonia]]). [[File:Mons MU4aJPG.jpg|thumb|right|The Mundaneum (Records Center of the Belgian French Community).|250px]] An English pamphlet published in 1914 contains this description: <blockquote> The International Centre organises collections of world-wide importance. These collections are the International Museum, the International Library, the International Bibliographic Catalogue and the Universal Documentary Archives. These collections are conceived as parts of one universal body of documentation, as an encyclopedic survey of human knowledge, as an enormous intellectual warehouse of books, documents, catalogues and scientific objects. Established according to standardized methods, they are formed by assembling cooperative everything that the participating associations may gather or classify. Closely consolidated and coordinated in all of their parts and enriched by duplicates of all private works wherever undertaken, these collections will tend progressively to constitute a permanent and complete representation of the entire world.

He is a Senior Manager in the Business Analytics and Mathematical Sciences Department at the [[IBM]] [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]], USA.<ref name=acm>[http://www.dsp.acm.org/view_lecturer.cfm?lecturer_id=1202 "Distinguished ACM Speaker: Murray Campbell"]</ref> The mission of the Services Modeling group is to apply deep technical expertise in areas such as [[Optimization (Infrastructure & Application Platform)|optimization]], [[forecasting]], [[probabilistic analysis]], and expertise sharing to a broad range of problems relevant to the IBM Services business. The primary focus is in the area of Business Analytics and Workforce Management, where solutions are developed that include services project/portfolio management, skill analytics, demand forecasting, workplace learning, workforce optimization, and strategic planning. Prior to the current position, Campbell was involved in surveillance projects related to petroleum production, disease outbreak, and financial data. In earlier work, Campbell was a member of the teams that developed chess machines: [[HiTech]] and a project to culminate in [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]], the latter being the first computer to defeat the reigning world [[chess]] champion, [[Garry Kasparov]], in a challenge match, in 1997. Kasparov had won an earlier match the previous year.(Based on text taken from a newsletter by Mike Oettel, of the Shriver Center at UMBC.) Campbell visited [[UMBC]] for a speech called "IBM's Deep Blue: Ten Years After" on February 5, 2007. In the University Center building, he presented the background that led up to the decisive match with Kasparov, reviewed the match itself (with Kasparov and similar matches), and explored some of the design decisions that were made when building Deep Blue. Murray put emphasis on some of the broader implications of Deep Blue's development and victory on
