ladder as it floats towards the towertop-which is sharply pointed. She rushes onto the balcony and jumps into the balloon, preventing it from hitting the tower's spire. After she pulls him back up, Louis thanks her and she notices the severed ropes, After Corinne rescues him, Louis appears to have fallen in love with her, but she doesn't see it. As they continue flying, the two realize they have a lot in common, especially the desire to pursue their dreams no matter what: Louis tells Corinne that he longs to make inventions that will help people, but his biggest dream is to show that men can fly. Now, he fears he will have to give up his dreams when he becomes king. Corinne comforts him, saying that he can still make his dreams come true even if he is king and shares her own aspiration of being a Musketeer. But the prince, like other people, thinks that girls can't be Musketeers, which angers her. When they land, Corinne yells at Louis, saying,"How is it, that a prince can imagine a man flying in the air, but not a girl as a musketeer." As she storms off, Louis is clearly sorry for hurting her feelings. Meanwhile, an infuriated Philippe watches from the palace. Later, down in the hidden chamber, Héléne and the girls are training while Corinne walks in and tells them what happened. As she does, she begins to notice a pattern with the accidents, especially the severed ropes, as Renee adds, "Yesterday the chandelier, today his flying machine?" It quickly becomes evident that a scheme of sabotage is in motion. Corinne shows the others the ruby she found and that she believes someone is trying to get rid of Louis. The girls think they should tell Treville, but Héléne tells them that until they have proof of a plot against the prince, they trust no one and for the girls to stay on their guard. Going home late one night, the four come across Philippe's captain and several of his men as they start opening crates full of fake swords for the prince's upcoming [[masquerade ball]]. They hide and watch as the captain unsheathes a sword, showing a real one hidden inside. Shocked, the girls overhear the men [[Conspiracy (political)|plotting]] to sneak the real swords into the ball and murder Louis. Corinne also notices the captain's snake-headed dagger is missing a ruby in the hilt. The four friends rush back to the palace and find Treville speaking with Philippe in the ballroom. Not realizing Philippe is in on the assassination plot, they tell the men what they saw and heard. The regent immediately claims that any plot against the prince would be impossible and that the girls made up the story in an attempt to be made Musketeers. Trying to prove their case, Corinne opens a crate of the party swords to show them the real swords concealed inside, but all the swords are fake. Without any solid evidence, Treville believes Philippe and that an assassination on Louis would be impossible (though not that the girls made up the story). Philippe banishes them from the castle, threatening to throw them in the dungeons if they cause anymore unnecessary trouble. Back at their apartment, the girls are thoroughly depressed and consider giving up, but Corinne points out that even though no one believes them, they can't just walk away from everything they've worked for. Inspired by her courage, the other three agree and make plans to sneak into the ball: Viveca makes their ball gowns and masks, Renée disguises their weapons to blend in with their outfits while Aramina gives Corinne dancing lessons. When the ball started, Corinne gave her name as Lady Barbeque while the other girls chose different names. After the ball starts, Philippe's men take out Treville and the Musketeers on guard duty while a disguised Philippe and more men get the real swords, which are hidden in the secret tunnels. Elsewhere, the girls also use the tunnels to enter the ballroom. Once there, the four friends and Héléne keep their eyes open for trouble. When the fireworks begin, it holds everyone's attention so that the assassins can start their plan. But, Corinne sees Philippe about to stab Louis with a sword. She quickly cartwheels in between them and disarms Philippe. Philippe alerts everyone that the sword Corinne is holding is real. Realizing what's happening, the girls strip off their ball gowns, revealing their own Musketeer uniforms and weapons as they face off against the henchmen. As the battle starts, the terrified guests scatter while Philippe, who pretends to be on his side, drags Louis into the passageway. The girls hold their own against the assassins with Héléne and Miette's help, but they are soon overwhelmed as more henchmen arrive. Thinking quickly, Viveca uses a smoke bomb made by Renée, blinding the guards and enabling the girls to escape into the tunnels and look for Louis. The prince soon realizes Philippe was behind the plot and runs when he tries to stab him. While searching for Louis, the girls find Treville and the other Musketeers tied up and free them. Viveca, Aramina and Renée stay behind to help the Musketeers stop the remaining henchmen while Corinne goes after the prince. [[File:Barbie and the Three Musketeers1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Corinne and the Three Musketeers.]] Louis, trying to escape Philippe, runs to the top of a tower and is cornered on a narrow ledge. As he slowly edges the prince towards the edge, Philippe tells Louis he's just a starly-eyed inventor who isn't fit to be king. Corinne arrives, but is on an opposite balcony and can't reach them. Seeing a hanging banner, she grabs onto it and swings towards the men. Just as Philippe is about to shove Louis off the ledge, Corinne lets go of the banner, flips in midair and lands just in time between the prince and his cousin. Philippe and her engage in a fierce sword fight and
