This is a listing of pointers to those articles which explain these functions in more detail. There is a large theory of [[special functions]] which developed out of [[statistics]] and [[mathematical physics]]. A modern, abstract point of view contrasts large [[function space]]s, which are infinite-dimensional and within which most functions are 'anonymous', with special functions picked out by properties such as [[symmetry]], or relationship to [[harmonic analysis]] and [[group representation]]s. See also [[List of types of functions]] ==Elementary functions== [[Elementary functions]] are functions built from basic operations (e.g. addition, exponentials, logarithms...) ===Algebraic functions=== [[Algebraic function]]s are functions that can be expressed as the solution of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. * [[Polynomial]]s: Can be generated by addition and multiplication alone. ** [[Linear function]]: First degree polynomial, graph is a straight line. ** [[Quadratic function]]: Second degree polynomial, graph is a [[parabola]]. ** [[Cubic function]]: Third degree polynomial. ** [[Quartic function]]: Fourth degree polynomial. ** [[quintic equation|Quintic function]]: Fifth degree polynomial. ** [[sextic equation|Sextic function]]: Sixth degree polynomial. * [[Rational function]]s: A ratio of two polynomials. * [[Nth root]] ** [[Square root]]: Yields a number whose square is the given one <math>x^{\frac{1}{2}} \!\ </math>. ** [[Cube root]]: Yields a number whose cube is the given one <math>x^{\frac{1}{3}} \!\ </math>. ===Elementary transcendental functions=== [[Transcendental function]]s are functions that are not algebraic. * [[Exponential function]]: raises a fixed number to a variable power. * [[Hyperbolic function]]s: formally similar to the trigonometric functions. * [[Logarithm]]s: the inverses of exponential functions; useful to solve equations involving exponentials. ** [[Natural logarithm]] ** [[Common logarithm]] ** [[Binary logarithm]] ** [[Indefinite logarithm]] * [[Exponentiation|Power functions]]: raise a variable number to a fixed power; also known as [[Allometric function]]s; note: if the power is a rational number it is not strictly a transcendental function. * [[Periodic function]]s ** [[Trigonometric function]]s: sine, cosine, tangent, etc.; used in [[geometry]] and to describe periodic phenomena.
