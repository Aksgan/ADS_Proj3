The architecture features [[3D computer graphics|3D acceleration]] based upon [[Microsoft Direct3D]] 8.0 and [[OpenGL|OpenGL 1.3]], a major improvement in features and performance compared to the preceding [[Radeon R100]] design. The GPU also includes [[2D computer graphics|2D GUI acceleration]], [[video]] acceleration, and multiple display outputs. "R200" refers to the development codename of the initially released GPU of the generation. It is the basis for a variety of other succeeding products. ==Architecture== R200's 3D hardware consists of 4 [[Graphics pipeline#Scan conversion or rasterization|pixel pipeline]]s, each with 2 texture sampling units. It has 2 vertex shaders and a legacy Direct3D 7 [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|TCL]] unit, marketed as ''Charisma Engine II''. It is ATI's first GPU with programmable pixel and vertex processors, called ''Pixel Tapestry II'' and compliant with Direct3D 8.1. R200 has advanced memory bandwidth saving and overdraw reduction hardware called ''HyperZ II'' that consists of [[occlusion culling]] (hierarchical Z), fast [[z-buffering|z-buffer]] clear, and z-buffer compression. The GPU is capable of dual display output (''[[ATI HydraVision|HydraVision]]'') and is equipped with a video decoding engine (''[[Video Immersion|Video Immersion II]]'') with adaptive hardware [[deinterlacing]], temporal filtering, [[motion compensation]], and [[Discrete cosine transform|iDCT]]. R200 introduced [[pixel shader]] version 1.4 (PS1.4), a significant enhancement to prior PS1.x specifications. Notable instructions include "phase", "texcrd", and "texld". The phase instruction allows a shader program to operate on two separate "phases" (2 passes through the hardware), effectively doubling the maximum number of texture addressing and arithmetic instructions, and potentially allowing the number of passes required for an effect to be reduced. This allows not only more complicated effects, but can also provide a speed boost by utilizing the hardware more efficiently. The "texcrd" instruction moves the texture coordinate values of a texture into the destination register, while the "texld" instruction will load the texture at the coordinates specified in the source register to the destination register. Compared to R100's 2x3 pixel pipeline architecture, R200's 4x2 design is more robust despite losing one texture unit per pipeline. Each pipeline can now address a total of 6 texture layers per pass. The chip achieves this by using a method known as 'loop-back'. Increasing the number of textures accessed per pass reduces the number of times the card is forced into multi-pass rendering. The texture filtering capabilities of R200 are also improved over its predecessor. For [[anisotropic filtering]], Radeon 8500 uses a technique similar to that used in R100, but improved with [[trilinear filtering]] and some other refinements. However, it is still highly angle-dependent and the driver sometimes forces [[bilinear filtering]] for speed. NVIDIA's [[GeForce 4 Series|GeForce 4 Ti]] series offered a more accurate anisotropic implementation, but with a greater performance impact. R200 has ATI's first implementation of a hardware-accelerated [[tessellation]] engine (a.k.a. higher order surfaces), called [[Truform]], which can automatically increase the geometric complexity of 3D models. The technology requires developer support and is not practical for all scenarios. It can undesirably round-out models. As a result of very limited adoption, ATI dropped TruForm support from its future hardware. {| width=80% align="center" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2" |- style="background:#ccccff;" ! || DirectX 8.0<BR>''Pixel Shader 1.1'' || DirectX 8.1<BR>''Pixel Shader 1.4'' |- | '''Max.

At launch, the card's performance was below expectations and it had numerous software flaws that caused problems with games. The chip's [[anti-aliasing]] support was only functional in Direct3D and was very slow. To dampen excitement for 8500, competitor [[nVidia]] released their Detonator4 driver package on the same day as most web sites previewed the Radeon 8500. nVidia's drivers were of better quality, and they also further boosted the [[GeForce 3]]'s performance. Several hardware review sites discovered that the performance of the Radeon 8500 in some actual game tests was lower than benchmarks reflected. For example, ATI was detecting the executable "Quake3.exe" and forcing the texture filtering quality to much lower than normally produced by the card. [[HardOCP]] was the first hardware review web site to bring the issue to the community, and proved its existence by renaming all instances of "Quake" in the executable to "Quack."<ref>Bennett, Kyle. [http://www.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTEx Optimizing or Cheating Radeon 8500 Drivers], Hard OCP, October 23, 2001.</ref> The result was improved image quality, but lower performance. However, even with the Detonator4 drivers, the Radeon 8500 was able to outperform the [[GeForce
