Storrs Hall| quote = Self-improvement was one of the aspects of AI proposed for study in the 1956 Dartmouth conference. Turing proposed a “child machine” which could be taught in the human manner to attain adult human-level intelligence. In latter days, the contention that an AI system could be built to learn and improve itself indefinitely has acquired the label of the bootstrap fallacy. Attempts in AI to implement such a system have met with consistent failure for half a century. Technological optimists, however, have maintained that a such system is possible, producing, if implemented, a feedback loop that would lead to a rapid exponential increase in intelligence. We examine the arguments for both positions and draw some conclusions. }} [http://mol-eng.com/bootstrap.pdf Self-archive]</ref> * [[Selmer Bringsjord]], The Logicist Manifesto<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bringsjord|first=Selmer|title=The Logicist Manifesto: At Long Last Let Logic-Based AI Become a Field Unto Itself|journal=Journal of Applied Logic|year=2008|month=December|volume=6|issue=4|pages=502–525| id = {{doi |10.1016/j.jal.2008.09.001}} |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B758H-4THJGN7-1&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2008&_rdoc=6&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info%28%23toc%2312927%232008%23999939995%23700611%23FLA%23display%23Volume%29&_cdi=12927&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=15&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=7fc83ceaf3be566605e0e9d8a24b9283|accessdate=2010-06-10|authorlink=Selmer Bringsjord|quote=This paper is a sustained argument for the view that logic-based AI should become a self-contained field, entirely divorced from paradigms that are currently still included under the AI “umbrella”—paradigms such as connectionism and the continuous systems approach.

It turns out that the supposedly characteristic features of “new AI” (embodiment, situatedness, absence of reasoning, and absence of representation) are all present in conventional systems: “New AI” is just like old AI. Brooks proposal boils down to the architectural rejection of central control in intelligent agents—Which, however, turns out to be crucial. Some of more recent cognitive science suggests that we might do well to dispose of the image of intelligent agents as central representation processors. If this paradigm shift is achieved, Brooks’ proposal for cognition without representation appears promising for full-blown intelligent agents—Though not for conscious agents.}} [http://www.typos.de/pdf/2007_AI_without_representation_M&M.pdf Self-archive]</ref> * [[Kristinn R.

To move artificial systems closer to such general-purpose intelligence we cannot avoid replicating some subset—quite possibly a substantial portion—of this large set. Progress in this direction requires that systems integration be taken more seriously as a fundamental research problem. In this paper I make the argument that intelligence must be studied holistically. I present key issues that must be addressed in the area of integration and propose solutions for speeding up rate of progress towards more powerful, integrated A.I. systems, including (a) tools for building large, complex architectures, (b) a design methodology for building realtime A.I. systems and (c) methods for facilitating code sharing at the community level. }}</ref> === Selected Submitted Papers: Future Possibilities for AI === * [[Eric Steinhart]], Survival as a Digital Ghost<ref>{{cite journal|last=Steinhart|first=Eric|title=Survival as a Digital Ghost|journal=Minds and Machines|year=2007|month=October|volume=17|issue=3|pages=261–271|doi=10.1007/s11023-007-9068-0 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w581g20mq8t68063/|accessdate=2010-06-10|quote=You can survive after death in various kinds of artifacts. You can survive in diaries, photographs, sound recordings, and movies. But these artifacts record only superficial features of yourself. We are already close to the construction of programs that partially and approximately replicate entire human lives (by storing their memories and duplicating their personalities). A digital ghost is an artificially intelligent program that knows all about your life. It is an animated auto-biography. It replicates your patterns of belief and desire. You can survive after death in a digital ghost. We discuss a series of digital ghosts over the next 50 years. As time goes by and technology advances, they are progressively more perfect replicas of the lives of their original authors. }}</ref> * [[Colin T. A.

Alternatively, they fail to state it suitably for the lesser-informed public eye. The author does not claim to be able to remedy this. Instead, the visionary investigation offered couples learning and computing with other related fields as part of a larger spectre to fully simulate people in their embodied image. For the first time, the social roles attributed to the technical objects produced are questioned, and so with a humorous illustration. }}</ref> * [[Michael Anderson]]{{dn}} & [[Susan Leigh Anderson]], The Status of Machine Ethics<ref>{{cite
