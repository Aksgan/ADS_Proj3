would receive <math>\textstyle\frac{10}{1}</math> = 10 apples. So for dividing by zero – what is the number of apples that each person receives when 10 apples are evenly distributed amongst 0 people? Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. The problem with this question is the "when". There is no way to distribute 10 apples amongst 0 people. In [[mathematical jargon]], a set of 10 items cannot be [[Partition of a set|partitioned]] into 0 subsets. So <math>\textstyle\frac{10}{0}</math>, at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be meaningless, or undefined. Similar problems occur if one has 0 apples and 0 people, but this time the problem is in the phrase "'''the''' number". A partition is possible (of a set with 0 elements into 0 parts), but since the partition has 0 parts, [[Vacuous truth|vacuously]] every set in our partition has a given number of elements, be it 0, 2, 5, or 1000. If there are, say, 5 apples and 2 people, the problem is in "evenly distribute". In any integer partition of a 5-set into 2 parts, one of the parts of the partition will have more elements than the other. In all of the above three cases, <math>\textstyle\frac{10}{0}</math>, <math>\textstyle\frac{0}{0}</math> and <math>\textstyle\frac{5}{2}</math>, one is asked to consider an impossible situation before deciding what the answer will be, and that is why the operations are undefined in these cases. To understand division by zero, one must check it with multiplication: multiply the quotient by the divisor to get the original number. However, no number multiplied by zero will produce a product other than zero. To satisfy division by zero, the quotient must be bigger than all other numbers, i.e., infinity. This connection of division by zero to infinity takes us beyond elementary arithmetic (see below). A recurring theme even at this elementary stage is that for every undefined arithmetic operation, there is a corresponding question that is not well-defined. "How many apples will each person receive under a fair distribution of ten apples amongst three people?" is a question that is not well-defined because there can be no fair distribution of ten apples amongst three people. There is another way, however, to explain the division: if one wants to find out how many people, who are satisfied with half an apple, can one satisfy by dividing up one apple, one divides 1 by 0.5. The answer is 2. Similarly, if one wants to know how many people, who are satisfied with nothing, can one satisfy with 1 apple, one divides 1 by 0. The answer is infinite; one can satisfy infinite people, that are satisfied with nothing, with 1 apple. Clearly, one cannot extend the operation of division based on the elementary combinatorial considerations that first define division, but must construct new number systems. ===Early attempts=== The [[Brahmasphutasiddhanta]] of [[Brahmagupta]] (598–668) is the earliest known text to treat [[0 (number)|zero]] as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero.<ref name="Kaplan">{{cite book | last = Kaplan | first = Robert | title = The nothing that is: A natural history of zero | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1999 | location = New York | pages = 68–75 | isbn = 0195142373}} </ref> The author failed, however, in his attempt to explain division by zero: his definition can be easily proven to lead to algebraic absurdities. According to Brahmagupta, <blockquote>A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.</blockquote> In 830, [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahavira]] tried unsuccessfully to correct Brahmagupta's mistake in his book in ''Ganita Sara Samgraha'': "A number remains unchanged when divided by zero."<ref name="Kaplan"/> [[Bhaskara II]] tried to solve the problem by defining (in modern notation) <math>\textstyle\frac{n}{0}=\infty</math>.<ref name="Kaplan"/> This definition makes some sense, as discussed below, but can lead to paradoxes if not treated carefully. These paradoxes were not treated until modern times. ==In algebra== It is generally regarded among mathematicians that a natural way to interpret division by zero is to first define division in terms of other arithmetic operations. Under the standard rules for arithmetic on [[integers]], [[rational numbers]], [[real numbers]], and [[complex numbers]], division by zero is undefined. Division by zero must be left undefined in any mathematical system that obeys the axioms of a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The reason is that [[division (mathematics)|division]] is defined to be the inverse operation of [[multiplication]]. This means that the value of ''a''/''b'' is the solution ''x'' of the equation ''bx'' = ''a'' whenever such a value exists and is unique. Otherwise the value is left undefined. For ''b'' = 0, the equation ''bx'' = ''a'' can be rewritten as 0''x'' = ''a'' or simply 0 = ''a''. Thus, in this case, the equation ''bx'' = ''a'' has ''no solution'' if ''a'' is not equal to 0, and has ''any'' ''x'' as a solution if ''a'' equals 0. In either case, there is no unique value, so <math>\textstyle\frac{a}{b}</math> is undefined. Conversely, in a [[field (mathematics)|field]], the expression <math>\textstyle\frac{a}{b}</math> is ''always'' defined if ''b'' is not equal to zero. ===Division as the inverse of multiplication=== The concept that explains [[Division (mathematics)|division]] in algebra is that it is the inverse of multiplication. For example, :<math>\frac{6}{3}=2</math> since 2 is the value for which the unknown quantity in :<math>?\times 3=6</math> is true. But the expression :<math>\frac{6}{0}=\,?</math> requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in :<math>?\times 0=6.</math> But any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so there is no number that solves the equation. The expression :<math>\frac{0}{0}=\,?</math> requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in :<math>?\times 0=0.</math> Again, any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so this time every number solves the equation instead of there being a single number that can be taken as the value of 0/0.
