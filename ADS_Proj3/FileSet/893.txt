versions had a slightly different file format and the baCIS 1 development language was developed in slightly different directions. The split in MEDUSA development was merged when Prime Computers acquired Computervision, with the promise to CV customers that VAX users would not be forced to switch to Prime workstations. Prime Computervision. Prime was divided into the two main divisions: Prime Hardware, which was responsible for the proprietary computer hardware, and Prime Computervision, which was responsible for the CAD/CAM business with MEDUSA and CADDS. With falling hardware sales Prime eventually stopped production of PrimOS computers and transferred its maintenance obligations to another company, thus being able to concentrate on the CAD/CAM software business. The company was renamed from Prime Computervision to Computervision (CV). == Hardware == In 1985, CV introduced an [[IBM]] 4361 based mainframe known as the CDS5000 to support Product Data Manager (PDM). This system never ran any graphics software but instead was used to manage the large number of product files and data that users were generating. The CDS5000 was networked with CDS4000 and CGP200X systems using serial links. Computervision was crucial to [[Sun Microsystems]] development as a company. CV was Sun's first large customer for [[Unix]]-based workstations. The CDS 3000 series of workstations were actually [[Sun-2]] systems with additional graphics hardware from CV. Ultimately in 1987, CV migrated from the DG derived CGP systems to [[Sun-3]] based workstations known as CADDStations with a [[VME bus]] version of the GPU. Computervision merged with [[Prime Computer]] in 1988 and acquired [[Calma|GE Calma]] (its major competitor in the microelectronic CAD market) in 1989. Computervision was acquired by [[Parametric Technology Corporation]] (PTC) in 1998, which (as of 2005) still supports the CADDS-5i product for existing users. In 2001, PTC sold the [[MEDUSA]] and [[MPDS Plant Design System]] software rights to CAD Schroer, which has developed a Fourth Generation of each system. == Customers of Computervision == One of the first major customers in the UK for ComputerVision were the construction company John Laing PLC. *[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qTbEcWMfoVAC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=CADDS+LAing+computervision&source=web&ots=IbJ0pzbtFA&sig=CswPNmsv0IC_6pcOzC9ykL164-g&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result] *[http://www.istructe.org/thestructuralengineer/HC/getfile.asp%3Fid%3D4024+%22JOhn+Laing%22+ComputerVision+-CV&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk] "In 1975 John Laing purchased a ComputerVision CADDS3 computer aided design and drafting system to carry out investigations into the use of CAD in the construction engineering and building environment" - Mervyn Richards, Laing technology Group (Thomas Telford Press, Institute of Civil Engineers, Conference - ISBN 072771340X ) Laing Design Partners, a division of John Laing had for some time been sponsoring work at Imperial University on the use of CAD in construction in the early 1970s and this led to Laing choosing the ComputerVision platform. At this time, Laing became the first CAD user in the UK Civil Engineering and Construction industry and were instrumental in developing and promoting the use of Computers in Construction. Mervyn Richards, responsible for this initiative later became one of the industries leading experts in Computer Aided Design, Modeling and construction IT ( see the BS1192 specification ) . His work with CADDS3, ComputerVision and Elstree Computing Limited lead to the development and distribution of many software tools for ComputerVision platforms, promoting their use and popularising the platform for many years - right up to CADDS5. The Queen Alia Airport, by example, was a classic project to which these systems were used [by John Laing PLC] [http://www.qaia.gov.jo/] The first higher educational user of Computervision equipment was State University of New York College of Technology at Alfred, New York which acquired a CADDS3 system in 1979 with the help of a NSF grant and generous donation of equipment by Computervision employees Virgil Ross, Drew Davis and Bob Gothie. Alfred State graduated their first AAS Computer Graphics Engineering Technology (TAC/ABET) Graduates in 1983 with Martin Allen as the featured graduation speaker. The first graduating class of 18 students had over 75 job offers, launching a 20 year history of unparalled placement success. One of the numerous "firsts" that was spun off the Alfred State program was a joint project with the New York State Department of Transportation, Region 6, to design highways and bridges and associated structures in 3-D CADDs which resulted in New York State being one of the first to use CADDS for highway design. == See also == *[[Comparison of CAD software|Comparison of CAD Software]] ==External links== *[http://www.ptc.com Parametric Technology Corp.] [[Category:Defunct software companies]] [[Category:Defunct computer companies of the United States]] [[Category:Computer-aided design software]] [[fr:Computervision]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7619</id> <title>Computron tube</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}} The '''Computron''' was an electron tube designed to perform the parallel addition and multiplication of digital numbers. It was conceived by Richard L. Snyder, Jr., [[Jan A. Rajchman]], Paul Rudnick and the digital computer group at the laboratories of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] under the direction of [[Vladimir Zworykin]]. Development began in 1941 under contract OEM-sr-591 to Division 7 of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] of the United States Office of Research and Development.<ref> David A. Mindell ''Between human and machine: feedback, control, and computing before cybernetics'',JHU Press, 2002 ISBN 0801868955, page 292 </ref> The numerical function of the Computron was to solve the equation <math>S=(A*B)+C+D</math> where A, B, C, and D are 14 bit inputs and S is a 28 bit output. This function was key to the RCA attempt to produce a non-[[analog computer]] based [[fire-control system]] for use in artillery aiming during WWII. A simple way to describe the physically complex Computron is to begin with a [[cathode ray tube]] structure in the form of a right-circular cylinder with a central vertical cathode structure. The cylinder is composed of 14 discrete planes, each plane having 14 individual radial outward projecting beams. Each of the 196 individual beams is steered by multiple deflection plates toward its two targets. Some deflection plates are connected to circuitry external to the Computron and are the data inputs. The balance of the plates are connected to internal targets and are the partial sums and products from other stages within the tube. Some of the targets are connected to circuitry outside the tube and represent the result. The electronic function of the Computron design incorporated steered, rather than
