The project includes a database of known carbohydrate structures and experimental data, specifically [[mass spectrometry]], [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and [[NMR]] data, accessed via a [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eurocarb/home.action web interface] that provides for browsing, searching and contribution of structures and data to the database. The project has also produces a number of associated [[bioinformatics]] tools for carbohydrate researchers: * GlycanBuilder, a Java applet for drawing glycan structures * GlycoWorkbench, a standalone Java application for semi-automated analysis and annotation of glycan mass spectra * GlycoPeakfinder, a webapp for calculating glycan compositions from mass data The [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eurocarb/home.action online version of EuroCarbDB] is hosted by the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]].

Founded in 1982, in France, EASE now has an international membership from diverse backgrounds and professional experience. == What does EASE do? == EASE helps its members keep up with trends in the rapidly changing environment of scientific publishing and sharpen their professional skills. *An electronic forum for exchanging shoptalk and ideas – the EASE-Forum *Annual general meetings linked with interesting lectures *A major conference every 3 years *Sessions during major scientific events (e.g. a careers session during [[Euroscience|EuroScience Open Forum]] 2010 in [[Torino]], [[Italy]] - see [http://nubes.esof2010.org/stored?vid=28 video]) *Seminars and workshops on hot topics (discounts available to EASE members) *Advertisements for jobs, courses and services on the EASE website (free of charge for EASE members) *The ''Science Editors’ Handbook'' (also distributed free of charge to EASE members), covering everything from on-screen editing to office management, peer review, and dealing with the media (see [http://www.ease.org.uk/handbook/index.shtml table of contents]) *Networking opportunities and contacts for freelancers *Opportunities to meet international colleagues *Leads for jobs, training and employment options == Publications == *A quarterly journal, [[European Science Editing]], featuring articles related to science and editing, book and web reviews, regional and country news, and resources *The [http://ese-bookshelf.blogspot.com/ EASE journal blog] – for contributions from members and non-members to selected sections of European Science Editing *A loose-bound book, the [http://www.ease.org.uk/handbook/index.shtml Science Editors’ Handbook], covering everything from on-screen editing to office management, peer review, and dealing with the media; new and updated chapters are published frequently and distributed to members and to non-members who have purchased the handbook *[http://www.ease.org.uk/statements/EASE_statement_on_impact_factors.shtml Statement on inappropriate use of impact factors] * [[EASE Guidelines]] [http://www.ease.org.uk/guidelines/index.shtml for Authors and Translators of Scientific Articles] '''available in many languages''' == Members == EASE has about 550 members who live in more than 50 countries, not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world. Members work in many disciplines and trades: commissioning editors, academics, translators, publishers, web and multi-media staff, indexers, graphic designers, statistical editors, science and technical writers, authors' editors, journalists, corporate communicators, technical illustrators, proofreaders and production personnel. == Major conferences == EASE holds a conference every 3 years. The next conference will be held in June 2012 in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. Previous conferences: :2009 [[Pisa]], [[Italy]] :2006 [[Krakow]], [[Poland]] :2003 [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[United Kingdom]] :2003 [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] (joint meeting with AESE) :2000 [[Tours]], [[France]] :1998 [[Washington, D.C.]], [[USA]] (joint meeting with CBE and AESE) :1997 [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] :1994 [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] :1991 [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom]] :1989 [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] (joint meeting with CBE and AESE) :1988 [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] :1985 [[Holmenkollen]], [[Norway]] :1982 [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], [[France]] == 2009 conference: Integrity in Science Communication == The 2009 EASE Conference, was held in [[Pisa]], [[Italy]] on 16-19 September 2009. It picked up the theme of the first World Conference on Research Integrity, which was held in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on 16-19 September 2007. The first World Conference was a joint initiative of the [[European Science Foundation]] and the [[United States Office of Research Integrity]]; it provided a forum for discussion of strategies for harmonizing research misconduct policies and for promoting responsible research conduct. The 2009 EASE Conference explored these themes from the viewpoint of people involved with scientific journal editing and publishing. Editors strive to ensure that the scientific research presented is correct, complete, accessible, retrievable and durable, i.e. to guarantee the physical integrity of the data. There is also a moral aspect to science communication, where editors have possibly a more difficult role to play, monitoring such aspects as conflict of interest, gender bias and guest authorship. The aim of the 2009 EASE Conference was to provide guidance to editors on ways in which they can monitor the physical and moral integrity of scientific communications passing through their hands, what to look out for and where they can turn for further advice. == History of EASE ==
