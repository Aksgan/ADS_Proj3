dates back to late 1996, and his major code contributions have been to the Apache HTTP server project. He is also the primary contributor to the [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/labs/pulse/ Apache Pulse] project, which provides [http://pulse.apache.org/ daily analyses] of all of the Apache mailing lists. Coar was also the Vice President and chair of the Apache Conferences project from 1998 through 2007 [http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2007/board_minutes_2007_10_17.txt], and was responsible for the ApacheCon shows which have been held in North America and Europe since 2000. He was the initial chair of the [[Apache Commons]] project, which eventually shut down [http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2004/board_minutes_2004_08_18.txt] without actually having accomplished much. He helped in the creation of the [[Apache Incubator]] project [http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2002/board_minutes_2002_10_16.txt]. In October 2005 the [[ASF]] board appointed Ken to be the Vice President and chair of the [[Apache Geronimo]] Application Server project [http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2005/board_minutes_2005_10_26.txt] in an attempt to repair the community dynamics. He voluntarily resigned one year later [http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2006/board_minutes_2006_11_15.txt], returning the now-healthy project to self-governance. A complete and current listing of Apache projects in which he is involved is available here: [http://people.apache.org/~jim/committers.html Apache Committers]. ===Open Source Initiative=== In 2004 Coar was invited to join the board of the [[OSI|Open Source Initiative]], and served as a director until 1 April 2010, when he voluntarily resigned. He was instrumental in improving internal organisation, expanding the board's composition internationally, and extending the OSI bylaws to allow for the creation of new initiatives. He was committed to expanding OSI's activities beyond software licence certification, and in turning the organisation into a grass roots membership structure. ===Other Open Software Projects=== Coar has made minor contributions to other projects, such as the [[PHP]] scripting language, the [[Habari]] blogging package, and a couple of [[Ruby gems]]. In the late 1990s he was involved in [[IBM]]'s efforts to get involved with the [[Apache HTTP Server]] project, and was instrumental in the development of a working relationship between the two. Coar has a few projects at [[SourceForge]] that he hacks on for fun. ===Publications=== Coar is the author of 'Apache Server for Dummies,' co-author of RFC 3875, 'Apache Server Unleashed,' and 'Apache Cookbook,' and has written articles for a number of publications including [http://linux-mag.com/ Linux Magazine], [[ACM Queue]], [http://linuxtoday.com Linux Today], [http://phpbuilder.com PHPBuilder], [http://enterpriseitplanet.com/ EnterpriseIT Planet], and [http://apachetoday.com Apache Today]. ==See also== * [[Apache Software Foundation]] * [[Habari]] * [[Open Source Initiative]] * [[PHP]] * [[RubyGems]] ==External links== * ''RFC 3875 * ''[http://Ken.Coar.Org/burrow/ The Rodent's Burrow] - Ken Coar's Web log (blog) * ''[http://twitter.com/theRoUS/ Ken Coar on Twitter] ==Bibliography== * ''Apache Server for Dummies'' (1999) ISBN 0-7645-0291-3 * ''Apache Server Unleashed'' (2000) ISBN 0-672-31808-3 * ''Apache Cookbook'' 1st edition (2003) ISBN 0-596-00191-6, 2nd edition (2008) ISBN 0-596-52994-5 * ''[http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=printer_friendly&pid=102&page=1 The Sun Never Sets on Distributed Development]'' ACM Queue, Volume 1, No. 9 * ''[http://www.enterpriseitplanet.com/security/features/article.php/3788951 Secure Apache: Out, Damned Bot!]'' (2008) Enterprise IT Planet * ''[http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/1999122400119NW Apache Software Foundation Member Ken Coar Interview]'' (1999) [Linux Today] * ''[http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/05/36170 Coar on Apache Site Defacement]'' (2000) [Wired News] {{Use dmy dates|date=August 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Coar, Ken}} [[Category:American bloggers]] [[Category:Computer programmers]] [[Category:Living people]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20503</id> <title>Ken Goldberg</title> <text>'''Kenneth Y. Goldberg''' (1961-) is a Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR), with a joint appointment in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and in the School of Information at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He is also a member of the ''[[Berkeley Center for New Media]]''. He is an [[artist]], writer, inventor, and researcher in the field of [[robotics]] and [[automation]]. ==Background== Goldberg was born in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]] and grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He received a BS in Electrical Engineering and BS in Economics, ''summa cum laude'', from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1984. Goldberg also received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1990. He then taught in the department of computer science at the [[University of Southern California]] from 1991-1995 and was visiting faculty in 2000 at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. [http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/art/cv-art.html] ==Career== Goldberg and his students develop new algorithms for Feeding, Fixturing, Grasping and Assembly, with an emphasis on minimalist approaches that require a minimum of sensing and complexity. For his PhD dissertation, Goldberg developed the first algorithm for orienting (feeding) polygonal parts and proved that the algorithm can be used to orient any part up to rotational symmetry. He also patented the kinematically yielding gripper, a new [[robot]] gripper that complies passively to hold parts securely without sensing. Named IEEE Fellow in 2005, Goldberg co-founded the [[IEEE]] Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering and his work has resulted in six United States [[patents]]. Goldberg is credited with developing the first robot with web interface (August 1994). His subsequent project, the [[Telegarden]], allowed remote visitors, via the Internet, to view, water, and plant seeds in a living garden. This project was online continuously for nine years in the lobby of the [[Ars Electronica Center]]. Goldberg is a leading researcher in networked [[telerobotics]] and has developed a series of collaborative tele-operation systems such as the Tele-Actor, in which a human moves through a remote environment guided by remote participants via the Internet. Goldberg is Founding Director of UC Berkeley's Art, Technology, and Culture Colloquium, established in 1997. This monthly speaker series brings artists, writers, and curators such as [[Billy Klüver]], [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and [[Bruno Latour]] to give evening lectures and is free and open to the public. Goldberg is editor of several books, including The Robot in the Garden: Telerobotics and Telepistemology in the Age of the Internet (MIT Press, 2000), which explores what is knowable at a distance. For his research, Goldberg was awarded the [[National Science Foundation]] Young Investigator Award in 1994, the [[National Science Foundation]] Presidential Faculty Fellowship in 1995, the [[Joseph F. Engelberger]] Robotics Award in 2000, the [[IEEE]] Major Educational Innovation Award in 2001. As an artist, Goldberg's work has been exhibited at the [[Whitney Biennial]], [[Venice Biennale]], Pompidou Center (Paris), Walker Art Center, Ars Electronica (Linz Austria), [[File festival]] (São Paulo), ZKM (Karlsruhe), ICC Biennale (Tokyo), Kwangju Biennale (Seoul), Artists Space, and The Kitchen (New York). He has held visiting positions at
