For Spencer, the super-organic was an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of interacting organisms, that is, human beings. And, as has been argued by D. C. Phillips, there is a "difference between emergence and reductionism."<ref>''Holistic Thought in Social Science'', D. C. Phillips, Stanford University Press, 1976, p. 123</ref> Similarly, economist [[Carl Menger]] expanded upon the evolutionary nature of much social growth, but without ever abandoning [[methodological individualism]]. Many social institutions arose, Menger argued, not as "the result of socially teleological causes, but the unintended result of innumerable efforts of economic subjects pursuing 'individual' interests."<ref>''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', Carl Menger, Louis Schneider (translator), New York University Press, 1985</ref> Spencer and Menger both argued that because it is individuals who choose and act, any social whole should be considered less than an organism, though Menger emphasized this more emphatically. Spencer used the organistic idea to engage in extended analysis of [[social structure]], conceding that it was primarily an analogy. So, for Spencer, the idea of the super-organic best designated a distinct level of [[social reality]] above that of biology and psychology, and not a one-to-one identity with an organism. Nevertheless, Spencer also argued that "every organism of appreciable size is a society," which has suggested to some that the issue may be terminological.<ref>''The Political Philosophy of Herbert Spencer'', Tim S. Gray, 1996, p. 211</ref> The term ''superorganic'' was adopted by anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in 1917<ref>''Patterns of Culture'', Ruth Benedict, Houghton Mifflin, 1934, p. 231</ref>. Social aspects of the superorganism concept are analysed in Marshall (2002)<ref>Marshall, A. (2002). ''[http://www.icpress.co.uk/books/histsci/p268.html The Unity of Nature]'', Imperial College Press, London.</ref>. ==Problems and criticisms== The question remains "What is to be considered ''the [[individualism|individual]]''?" Some [[biologist]]s such as [[Richard Dawkins]] suggest that the individual selected is the [[selfish gene]].<ref>''The Selfish Gene'', Oxford University Press, 1976</ref> It would appear{{Weasel-inline|date=January 2011}}, from computer [[simulation]]s like [[Daisyworld]] that biological [[natural selection|selection]] occurs at multiple levels simultaneously.{{Fact|date=January 2011}} Some scientists have suggested that individual human beings can be thought of as "superorganisms"; as a typical human digestive system contains 10<sup>13</sup> to 10<sup>14</sup> microorganisms whose collective [[genome]] ("[[microbiome]]") contains at least 100 times as many genes as our own <ref>Gill S.
