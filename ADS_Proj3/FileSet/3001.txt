they first conquered the area) with a fascination for metaphysics. They did not suspect that such speculations had foundations neither in created nor in spiritual reality. ''No one would today accept as true what is not empirically observable'', or at least verifiable by inference, from an attested effect. So it is with patristic theology. Dialectical speculation about God and the Incarnation as such are rejected. Only those things which can be tested by the experience of the grace of God in the heart are to be accepted. "Be not carried about by divers and strange teachings. For it is good that the heart be confirmed by grace," a passage from Hebrews 13.9, quoted by the Fathers to this effect.}}</ref> The West does this through what the East calls an incompleteness as a form of theology called [[kataphatic theology]]. The East does not use kataphatic statements about God to validate God since to use positive statements about God goes against God's very being (ontology) which is [[apophatic theology|apophatic]] and therefore incomprehensible and not rational. === Judaism === According to [[Hasidic philosophy|Chasidic Thought]] (particularly as propounded by [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]) of [[Chabad]], God is held to be [[Immanence|immanent]] within [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] for two interrelated reasons. * Firstly, a very strong Jewish belief is that "[t]he Divine life-force which brings [the universe] into existence must constantly be present... were this life-force to forsake [the universe] for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation..." <ref>http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive2.asp?AID=7988</ref> * Secondly, and simultaneously, Judaism holds as [[axiom]]atic that [[Jewish principle of faith#God is One|God is an absolute unity]], and that He is [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|Perfectly Simple]] - thus if His sustaining power is within nature, then His essence is also within nature. However, the [[Vilna Gaon]] was very much against this philosophy, for he felt that it would lead to pantheism and [[heresy]]. According to some this is the main reason for the Gaon's ban on Chasidism. Note that, at the same time, Jewish thought considers God as separate from all physical, created things ([[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]) and as existing outside of time (eternal). For a discussion of the resultant [[paradox]]; see ''[[Tzimtzum]]''. : See also [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]]. According to Maimonides, (see Foundations of the Law, Chapter 1), God is an incorporeal being that caused all other existence. In fact, God is defined as the necessary existent that caused all other existence. According to Maimonides, to admit corporeality to God is tantamount to admitting complexity to God, which is a contradiction to God as the First Cause and constitutes heresy. While Hasidic mystics considered the existence of the physical world a contradiction to God's simpleness, Maimonides saw no contradiction. See the Guide for the Perplexed, especially chapter I:50. === Islam === Many followers of Sufism advocated monism. Most notably the 13th-century Persian poet [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi-Rumi]] (1207–73) in his didactic poem [[Masnavi]] espoused monism.<ref name="nicholson">[http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html Reynold Nicholson ''Rumi'']</ref><ref>[http://www.rumi.org.uk/sufism/persian_sufism.htm Cyprian Rice, O.P., (1964) ''The Persian Sufism'' George Allen, London]</ref> Rumi says in the [[Masnavi]], "in the shop for Unity (wahdat); anything that you see there except the One is an idol."<ref name="nicholson" /> According to Vincent J. Cornell, the Qur'an also provides a monist image of God by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things:"He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward; He is the Knower of everything (Sura {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}})".<ref>Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562</ref> Another verse in the Quran is "To God belongs the East and the West, Wheresoever you look is the face of God.(Sura {{cite quran|2|115|style=nosup|expand=no}})". There are many other verses such as Quran 15:29, 38:72 etc. which say that God blew spirit into man. It is mistakenly believed that there is an imprint of God in man.There are many verses in the Quran which indicate that He is the only Creator and there is nothing like unto him. === Baha'i === Although the [[Bahá'í teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Britannica |year = 1992 |contribution = The Bahá'í Faith |title = Britannica Book of the Year |place = Chicago |isbn = 0852294867 |author = editors, Daphne Daume, Louise Watson. |publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannica |location = Chicago | ref = harv }}</ref> The ''[[Seven Valleys]]'' is considered Bahá'u'lláh's "greatest mystical composition."

It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bahá'u'lláh to the [[Western world|West]]. The ''[[Hidden Words]]'' is another book written by Bahá'u'lláh during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Bahá'u'lláh claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.<ref name="hiddenwords">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Hidden Words |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |page= 181}}</ref> == Theological growth and breadth == Many forms of [[Hinduism]] (including [[Vedanta]], some forms of [[Yoga]], and certain schools of [[Shaivism]]), [[Taoism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and similar systems of thought explore the [[mystical]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] elements of a monistic philosophy. With increasing awareness of these systems of thought, western spiritual and philosophical climate has seen a growing understanding of monism. Moreover, the [[New Thought]] and [[New Age]] movements embraced many monistic concepts during the twentieth century and
