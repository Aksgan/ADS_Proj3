"closed" but simply closed to the public to become a private, invitation-only system. Rumors of a private, "inside" MindVox circulated, fueled by reprints of supposed internal MindVox messages from 1998 and 1999 that circulated on various mailing lists. The ''mindvox.com'' domain remained registered while, for a time, mail to ''phantom.com'' was redirected to Interport. The major discrepancy between the Times and Wired dates lends additional credence to the idea that MindVox continued, at least for a while, to support a community after its modem lines were turned off. ==MindVox in the 21st Century== [[Image:MindVox2007.jpg|thumb|277px|right|MindVox logo, circa 2007.]] During 2000 a variety of MindVox pieces went back online<ref name="mvhist9">[http://web.archive.org/web/20010309141332/http://mindvox.com/ Archive.org copy of MindVox website, circa 2000]</ref>, at ''phantom.com'' and additional material was released by MindVox to ''[[textfiles.com]]''. By 2001, Kroupa was back in the public eye and openly acknowledged being a lifelong [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addict]], who had finally kicked [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] through the use of the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]] [[ibogaine]]. It is unclear whether mailing lists on MindVox continued in perpetuity from the 90s, or began reappearing in 2000, but in addition to the Vox list it was hosting, by 2001 MindVox was a hub of activity in the fields of [[harm reduction]], [[drug policy reform]], and [[psychedelic drug]]s (most notably [[Ibogaine]])<ref name="iboList">[http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/ The Ibogaine section of MindVox]</ref>. While the drug-related community surrounding [http://ibogaine.mindvox.com MindVox : Ibogaine] has taken on a completely new life; the interactive system itself, and the internal conferences and other services MindVox provided, have not returned (despite announcements and plans heralding the perpetually-delayed rebirth of MindVox)<ref name="mvoxreopen90s">[http://web.archive.org/web/19991129054703/www.mindvox.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MindVox Archive.org snapshot of MindVox beta test circa 1999]</ref>. In 2005, MindVox was featured in two documentary films. Bruce Fancher is interviewed in ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]'',<ref name="bbsdoc">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402/ IMDB: BBS: The Documentary]</ref>, and Patrick Kroupa plays himself in ''[[Ibogaine: Rite of Passage]]'',<ref name="ibofilm">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431823/ IMDB: Ibogaine: Rite of Passage]</ref>. On December 9, 2005, the [[Transcriptions Project]]<ref name="transcriptions">[http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/ transcriptions project() Project at UC's Department of English]</ref>, placed [[Agrippa (A Book of the Dead)|The Agrippa Files]] online<ref name="agrippa1">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/ transcriptions project() Agrippa archive]</ref>, which included [[Matthew G. Kirschenbaum]]'s, "Hacking 'Agrippa': The Source of the Online Text," an excerpt from his book ''Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination''<ref name="agrippa4">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/kirschenbaum-matthew-g-hacking-agrippa-the-source-of-the-online-text/ transcriptions project() Hacking Agrippa]</ref>. The "Agrippa" discussed by Kirschenbaum was an unusual [[cyberpunk]]-influenced media project from 1992 by the science-fiction author [[William Gibson]]; its first public "leak" was to MindVox users in December of that year. Within the chapter, Kirschenbaum references several personal letters to Patrick Kroupa, circa 2003, and reveals that Kroupa cooperated with him by placing all of MindVox back online "for an hour or 5"<ref name="kroupaagrippa">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/kirschenbaum-matthew-g-hacking-agrippa-the-source-of-the-online-text/#3 Patrick Kroupa places MindVox back online for a few hours in 2003]</ref> so that Kirschenbaum could view the context within which Agrippa was originally released. In discussing the service, Kirschenbaum referred to MindVox as "a kind of interface between what [[Alan Sondheim]] has aptly called the ''darknet'' and the clean, well lighted cyberspaces"<ref name="agrippa0">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/kirschenbaum-matthew-g-hacking-agrippa-the-source-of-the-online-text/ transcriptions project() Agrippa: Hacking the Online Text]</ref>. ==MindVox Reloaded== In January 2009 the mindvox.com website changed for the first time in over 8 years and featured a new third generation MindVox logo along with the caption '''Hell Frozen Over''' and a counter ticking down to [[April Fools' Day]]. On April 1, 2009, MindVox appears to have relaunched for the first time in the 21st century<ref name="mvreloaded">[http://www.mindvox.com/request_access MindVox relaunch]</ref>. ==External links== * [http://mindvox.com/ Official website] While the labyrinth of conferences, files and user interactions providing a unique overview of the birth of the public internet that are buried within the depths of MindVox have never re-surfaced or been made publicly available, limited archives of some parts of the service remain online at: * http://www.phantom.com/ * http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/ An [[IRC]] channel, [[EFnet]] #mindvox, created in the 1990s, has survived as a gathering place for some members of the older community. ==References== {{reflist|2}} {{MindVox}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Mindvox}} [[Category:MindVox|*]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 1991]] [[Category:History of the Internet]] [[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24616</id> <title>Mind extension</title> <text>{{Context|date=October 2009}} In recent years several [[philosopher]]s have broached the idea that mind should not be considered to be something which is just in the head but in various ways can be spread out onto the world. This is a [[materialist]] rather than spiritualist notion, the mind being thought of as extending over the brain, external language and media such as charts, diaries and indeed any material substrate that can become intimately involved in our mindful actions. == Select Quote == One of the proponents of this view is [[Andy Clark]]. He illustrates the concept with an example that deals with a specific group of [[Alzheimer's]] patients in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] (from p. 140 of the book ''Natural-Born Cyborgs''): <blockquote>These patients were a puzzle because although they still lived alone, successfully, in the city, they really should not have been able to do so. On standard psychological tests they performed rather dismally. They should have been unable to cope with the demands of daily life. What was going on?</blockquote> <blockquote>A sequence of visits to their home environments provided the answer. These home environments, it transpired, were wonderfully calibrated to support and scaffold these biological brains. The homes were stuffed full of cognitive props, tools, and aids. Examples included message centers where they stored notes about what to do and when; photos of family and friends complete with indications of names and relationships; labels and pictures on doors; "memory books" to record new events, meetings, and plans; and "open-storage" strategies in which crucial items (pots, pans, checkbooks) are always kept in plain view, not locked away in drawers.</blockquote> <blockquote>Before you allow this image of intensive scaffolding to simply confirm your opinion of these patients as hopelessly cognitively compromised, try to imagine a world in which normal human brains are somewhat Alzheimic. Imagine that in this world we had gradually evolved a society in which the kinds of scaffolding found in the St. Louis home environments were the norm. And then reflect that, in a certain sense, this is exactly what
