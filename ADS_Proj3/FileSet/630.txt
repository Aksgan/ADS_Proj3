Some preliminary information released by IBM references the DD1 variant. As a result some early journalistic accounts of the Cell's capabilities now differ from production hardware. ====Cell floorplan==== [Powerpoint material accompanying an STI presentation given by Dr Peter Hofstee], includes a photograph of the DD2 Cell die overdrawn with functional unit boundaries which are also captioned by name, which reveals the breakdown of silicon area by function unit as follows: <!-- I wasn't able to square-up the image when measuring dimensions off screen, since I only had area, but not W*H so these are a little more approx. than they might have been; I had W*H for the included SPU but the top four SPU measure differently than the bottom four in the way they overdrew the boundaries, leaving me with the same problem --> {| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |+ '''Cell Function Units and Footprint''' !

Not for this chicken. Some diehard can suffer or this can wait until MediaWiki is fixed properly. --> Understanding the dispatch pipes is important to write efficient code. In the SPU architecture, two instructions can be dispatched (started) in each clock cycle using dispatch pipes designated ''even'' and ''odd''. The two pipes provide different execution units, as shown in the table above. As IBM partitioned this, most of
