It is based on the Goal Question Metric paradigm and adds the capability to create measurement programs that ensure alignment between business goals and strategies, software-specific goals, and measurement goals. ==See also== * Basili, Victor R.

For the past 7 years the [[British Geological Survey]] has been acting as a test bed for the accelerated development of the system. Since its roll-out throughout the Survey GSI3D has started to revolutionise the working practices, data standards and products of a [[geological survey]] as a whole. The software is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and data is stored in extensible mark-up language [[XML]]. The BGS is currently undertaking a 3 year research and development project to further extend the GSI3D methodology to deal with [[Fault (geology)|faulted]] bedrock terrain. == A brief outline of the methodology == GSI3D utilizes a [[digital elevation model]], surface geological linework and downhole [[borehole]] data to enable the geologist to construct cross sections by correlating boreholes and the outcrops to produce a geological fence diagram. Mathematical interpolation between the nodes along the drawn sections and the limits of the units produces a solid model comprising a stack of [[triangulated]] objects each corresponding to one of the geological units present. Scientsts draw their sections based on facts such as borehole logs correlated by intuition - the shape 'looks right' to a geologist. This 'looks right' element pulls on the geologists' wealth of understanding of earth processes, examination of exposures and theoretical knowledge gathered over a career in geology. GSI3D enables the efficient capture of tacit and implicit knowledge which was until now trapped in geologist's heads. == Application of Models == The biggest single user of geological models at present is the [[Environment Agency]] of England and Wales. The models are used in groundwater resource management and aquifer vulnerability assessments. The BGS is responding to the increasing need of reliable groundwater models by creating direct links between GSI3D and the groundwater modelling software [[ZOOMQ3D]]. == References == * Mathers, S.J., & H.
