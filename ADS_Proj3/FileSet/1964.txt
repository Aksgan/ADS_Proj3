the dwellings of a small number of rich nobles or merchants and cathedrals and churches. ====Technical advances==== The wish to return to classical architecture created problems for the Renaissance buildings. The builders did not use concrete and thus comparable vaults and domes had to be replicated in brick or stone. The greatest technical feats were undoubtedly in these areas. The first major breakthrough was Brunelleschi's project for the [[dome]] of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]]. Brunelleschi managed to devise a way of building a huge dome without formwork, relying instead on the weight of the bricks and the way they were laid to keep them in position and the shape of the dome to keep it standing. The exact way the dome was built is still subject to heated debate today as it is not possible to take the dome apart to study its construction without destroying it. The dome is a double skin, linked by ribs, with a series of wooden and stone chains around it at intervals to attempt to deal with hoop stresses. Brunelleschi's dome was completed (up to the base of the lantern) in 1446. It's size however was soon surpassed by the dome of St Peter's, built using flying scaffolding supported on the cornices and constructed using two stone shells. ===Construction in the seventeenth century=== The seventeenth century saw the birth of modern science which would have profound effects on building construction in the centuries to come. The major breakthroughs were towards the end of the century when architect-engineers began to use experimental science to inform the form of their buildings. However it was not until the 18th century that engineering theory developed sufficiently to allow sizes of members to be calculated. Seventeenth century structures this relied strongly on experience, rules of thumb and the use of scale models. ====Materials==== The major breakthrough in this period was in the manufacture of [[glass]], with the first cast plate glass being developed in France. Iron was increasingly employed in structures. [[Christopher Wren]] used iron hangers to suspend floor beams at [[Hampton Court Palace]], and iron rods to repair [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and strength the dome of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Most buildings had stone [[ashlar]] surfaces covering rubble cores, held together with lime mortar. Experiments were made mixing lime with tarrass to provide a hydraulic mortar, but there was still no equivalent of the Roman Concrete. In England, France and Holland cut and gauged brickwork was used to provide detailed and ornate facades. The triangulated roof truss was introduced to England and used by Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren. There were many tools which have grown obsolete since the advent of modern technology, but which were previously used by all builders. Some major examples are the [[plumb-line]], the [[slide-rule]] and the [[Compass (drafting)|drafting compass]]. ====Methods==== Despite the birth of experimental science, the methods of construction in this period remained largely medieval. The same types of cranes that had been used in previous centuries were being still being employed. Flying scaffolds were employed at St Paul's Cathedral, England and in the dome of St Peters, Rome, but otherwise the same types of timber scaffolding that had been in use centuries before were retained. Cranes and scaffolding depended on timber. Complex systems of pulleys allowed comparatively large loads to be lifted, and long ramps were used to haul loads up to the upper parts of buildings. ===Construction in the eighteenth century=== The eighteenth century saw the development of many the ideas that had been born in the late seventeenth century. The architects and engineers became increasingly professionalised. Experimental science and mathematical methods began increasingly sophisticated and employed in buildings. At the same time the birth of the industrial revolution saw and increase in the size of cities and and increase in the pace and quantity of construction. ====Materials==== The major breakthroughs in this period were in the use of iron (both cast and wrought). Iron columns had been used in Wren's designs for the House of Commons and were used in several early 18th century churches in London, but these supported only galleries. In the second half of the eighteenth century the decreasing costs of iron production allowed the construction of major pieces of iron engineering. The Iron Bridge at Coalbrookdale (1779) is a particularly notable example. Large scale mill construction required fire-proof buildings and cast iron became increasingly used for columns and beams to carry brick vaults for floors. The Louvre in Paris boasted an early example of a wrought iron roof. Steel was used in the manufacture of tools but could not be made in sufficient quantities to be used for building. Brick production increased markedly during this period. Many buildings throughout Europe were built of brick, but they were often coated in lime render, sometimes patterned to look like stone. Brick production itself changed little. Bricks were moulded by hand and fired in kilns no different to those used for centuries before. Terracotta in the form of [[Coade stone]] was used as an artificial stone in the UK. ===Construction in the nineteenth century: Industrial Revolution=== [[Image:Old timer structural worker2.jpg|thumb|A structural worker building the [[Empire State Building]]. Workers such as this man were often referred to as "old timers" because in that time era, mostly only middle-aged men worked on building structures.]] The [[industrial revolution]] was manifested in new kinds of [[transportation]] installations, such as [[railway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[macadam]] roads. These required large amounts of [[investment]]. New construction devices included [[steam engine]]s, [[machine tools]], [[explosives]] and optical [[surveying]]. As [[steel]] was mass-produced from the mid-19th century, it was used, in form of [[I-beam]]s and [[reinforced concrete]]. [[Glass]] panes also went into mass production, and changed from luxury to every man's property. [[Plumbing]] appeared, and gave common access to [[drinking water]] and [[Sanitary sewer|sewage collection]]. ===Construction in the twentieth century=== With the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the early 20th century, [[elevator]]s and [[crane (machine)|cranes]] made [[high rise]] buildings and [[skyscraper]]s possible, while [[Heavy equipment (construction)|Heavy equipment]]s and [[power tools]] decreased the
