It was created by [[Roberto Di Cosmo]], Vincent Balat and Jean-Vincent Loddo, in 1998. The DemoLinux CD was created to make it possible to use Linux without having to install it on the hard disk. It is the first Linux Live CD making possible to use the system in graphic mode and without any stage of configuration. There are many other Live CD today. One can consider DemoLinux as the ancestor of [[Knoppix]]. DemoLinux offered to the users hundreds of applications (among which [[KDE]] and [[StarOffice]]) thanks to a compressed file system. The CD could be used without any modification on the hard disk, but the user had the possibility to use in a transparent way a space on the disc to store his personal data, and even to install new applications using the standard tools of the base distribution. Version 1 was based on Mandrake Linux (now Mandriva), versions 2 and 3 used a mechanism independent of the distribution and were distributed mainly on a Debian basis. These last versions made it possible moreover to install Linux on the hard disk, thus offering a very simple installation procedure of Debian (this principle is used today by other Linux distributions). DemoLinux has been distributed in many magazines in several countries. It is still downloadable from the official website, but has not evolved since 2002. == External links == * [http://www.demolinux.org/ Official website] {{linux-distro}} [[Category:Discontinued Linux distributions]] [[es:DemoLinux]] [[fr:DemoLinux]] [[pt:Demolinux]] [[ro:DemoLinux]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9923</id> <title>Demographic and Health Surveys</title> <text>{{News release|article|date=August 2010}} The [http://www.measuredhs.com/ MEASURE DHS] (Demographic and Health Surveys) Project is responsible for collecting and disseminating accurate, nationally representative data on health and population in [[developing countries]]. The project is implemented by Macro International, Inc. and is funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] ([[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]) with contributions from other donors such as [[Unicef|UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and [[UNAIDS]]. Since October 2003 Macro International has been partnering with four internationally experienced organizations to expand access to and use of the DHS data: [http://www.jhuccp.org/ The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs]; [http://www.path.org/ Program for Appropriate Technology in Health] ([[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health|PATH]]); [http://www.blueraster.com/ Blue Raster]; [http://www.camrisinternational.com/ CAMRIS International]; and [http://www.futuresinstitute.org/ The Futures Institute]. ==About MEASURE DHS== Since 1984, the MEASURE DHS Project has provided technical assistance to more than 260 demographic and health surveys in over 90 countries - advancing global understanding of health and population trends in developing countries. More specifically, the DHS surveys collect information on [[fertility]] and [[Total Fertility Rate|total fertility rate]] (TFR), [[Reproductive Health|reproductive health]], [[maternal health]], child health, [[immunization]] and [[child survival|survival]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]; [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]], [[child mortality]], [[malaria]], and nutrition among women and children [[stunted]]. The strategic objective of MEASURE DHS is to improve and institutionalize the collection and use of data by host countries for program monitoring and evaluation and for policy development decisions. MEASURE DHS is one of four components of the “Monitoring and Evaluation to Assess and Use Results” (MEASURE) effort begun in 1997. The other three MEASURE partner projects are MEASURE Evaluation, MEASURE U.S. Census Bureau-SCILS, and MEASURE CDC/DRH in cooperation with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. ==Surveys== MEASURE DHS supports a range of data collection options: * Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS): provide data for a wide range of monitoring and impact evaluation indicators in the areas of population, health, and nutrition. * AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS): provide countries with a standardized tool to obtain indicators for the effective monitoring of national HIV/AIDS programs. * Service Provision Assessment (SPA) Surveys: provide information about the characteristics of health and family planning services available in a country. * Malaria Indicators Surveys (MIS): Provide data on bednet ownership and use, prevention of malaria during pregnancy, and prompt and effective treatment of fever in young children. In some cases, biomarker testing for malaria and anemia are also included. * Key Indicators Survey (KIS): provide monitoring and evaluation data for population and health activities in small areas—regions, districts, catchment areas—that may be targeted by an individual project, although they can be used in nationally representative surveys as well. * Other Quantitative Data: include Geographic Data Collection, and Benchmarking Surveys. * [[Biomarker]] Collection: in conjunction with surveys, more than 2 million tests have been conducted for HIV, anemia, malaria, and more than 25 other biomarkers. * Qualitative Research: provides informed answers to questions that lie outside the purview of standard quantitative approaches. ==Data== MEASURE DHS works to put survey data into the hands of program managers, health care providers, policymakers, country leaders, researchers, members of the media, and others who can act to improve public health. MEASURE DHS distributes unrestricted survey data files for legitimate academic research at no cost. Online databases include: [http://www.statcompiler.com/ STATcompiler], [http://macroint.mapsherpa.com/statmapper/ STATmapper], [http://www.measuredhs.com/hivdata/ HIV/AIDS Survey Indicators Database], [http://www.hivspatialdata.net/ HIV Spatial Data Repository], [http://www.hivmapper.com/ HIVmapper], and [http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/ Country QuickStats]. ==Publications== MEASURE DHS produces a variety of publications that provide country specific and comparative data on population, health, and nutrition in developing countries. Most publications are available online for download, but if an electronic version of the publication is not available, a hard copy may be available. ==Countries== The MEASURE DHS Project has been active in over 90 countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central Asia]]; [[West Asia]]; and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. A list of the publications for each country is available online at the Measure DHS web site.<ref>[http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/ Measure DHS Country List]</ref> The MEASURE DHS Project has been active in the following countries: {| style="width:75%; background: transparent;" | '''A''' || |- | {{flag|Afghanistan}} || {{flag|Albania}} || {{flag|Armenia}} |- | {{flag|Angola}} || {{flag|Azerbaijan}} |- | <br> |- | '''B''' || |- | {{flag|Bangladesh}} || {{flag|Botswana}} || {{flag|Burundi}} |- | {{flag|Benin}} || {{flag|Brazil}} |-
