they obey the [[superposition principle]]; if ''F(v)'' is the output of a linear element with an input of ''v'': :<math>F(v_1 + v_2) = F(v_1) + F(v_2) \,</math> So if two sine wave signals are applied to a linear device, the output is simply the sum of the outputs when the two signals are applied separately, with no product terms. So the function ''F'' must be nonlinear. Examples of nonlinear components that are used as mixers are [[vacuum tube]]s and [[transistor]]s biased near cutoff ([[class C amplifier|class C]]), and [[diode]]s. For lower frequencies, IC [[analog multiplier]]s can be used which multiply signals precisely. [[Magnetic core|Ferromagnetic core]] [[inductor]]s driven into [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] can also be used. In [[nonlinear optics]], crystals that have nonlinear characteristics are used to mix [[laser]] light beams to create heterodynes at optical frequencies. == Output of a mixer == To demonstrate mathematically how a nonlinear component can multiply signals and generate heterodyne frequencies, the nonlinear function ''F'' can be expanded in a [[power series]] ([[MacLaurin series]]): :<math>F(v) = \alpha_1 v + \alpha_2 v^2 + \alpha_3 v^3 + \ldots \,</math> To simplify the math, the higher order terms above ''α<sub>2</sub>'' will be indicated by an ellipsis (". . .") and only the first terms will be shown. Applying the two sine waves at frequencies ''ω<sub>1</sub>'' = 2π''f<sub>1</sub>'' and ''ω<sub>2</sub>'' = 2π''f<sub>2</sub>'' to this device: :<math>v_{out} = F(A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin \omega_2 t)\,</math> :<math>v_{out} = \alpha_1 (A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin \omega_2 t) + \alpha_2(A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin \omega_2 t)^2 + \ldots \,</math> :<math>v_{out} = \alpha_1 (A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin \omega_2 t) + \alpha_2(A_1^2 \sin^2 \omega_1 t + 2 A_1 A_2 \sin \omega_1 t \sin \omega_2 t + A_2^2 \sin^2 \omega_2 t) + \ldots \,</math> It can be seen that the second term above contains a product of the two sine waves. Simplifying with [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]]: :<math>v_{out} = \alpha_1 (A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin \omega_2 t) + \alpha_2(\frac{A_1^2}{2} [1 - \cos 2 \omega_1 t] + A_1 A_2 [\cos (\omega_1 t - \omega_2 t) - \cos (\omega_1 t + \omega_2 t) ] + \frac{A_2^2}{2} [1 - \cos 2 \omega_2 t] ) + \ldots \,</math> :<math>v_{out} = \alpha_2 A_1 A_2 \cos (\omega_1 - \omega_2 )t - \alpha_2 A_1 A_2 \cos (\omega_1 + \omega_2 ) t + \ldots \,</math> So the output contains sinusoidal terms with frequencies at the sum ''ω<sub>1</sub>'' + ''ω<sub>2</sub>'' and difference ''ω<sub>1</sub>'' - ''ω<sub>2</sub>'' of the two original frequencies. It also contains terms at the original frequencies and at multiples of the original frequencies 2''ω<sub>1</sub>'', 2''ω<sub>2</sub>'', 3''ω<sub>1</sub>'', 3''ω<sub>2</sub>'', etc.; the latter are called [[harmonics]]. These unwanted frequencies, along with the unwanted heterodyne frequency, must be filtered out of the mixer output to leave the desired heterodyne. == Applications == Heterodyning is used very widely in [[communications engineering]] to generate new frequencies and move information from one frequency channel to another. Besides its use in the superheterodyne circuit which is found in almost all radio and television receivers, it is used in [[radio transmitter]]s, [[modem]]s, [[satellite]] communications and set-top boxes, [[radar]], [[radio telescope]]s, [[telemetry]] systems, [[cell phone]]s, [[cable television]] converter boxes and [[Cable television headend|headends]], [[microwave relay]]s, [[metal detector]]s, [[atomic clock]]s, and military [[electronic countermeasures]] (jamming) systems. ===Up and down converters=== In digital communications signals can be transmitted in [[baseband]] or [[passband]]. On receiver side usually a downconverter is used to transform the signal from the [[passband]] back to the [[baseband]] for further processing. The local oscillator frequency is <math>\sqrt{2} e^{j2 \Pi f_c t}</math>, with <math>f_c</math> being the carrier frequency. This results in a scaling of the received signal by <math>\sqrt{2}</math> and a phase shifting by <math>f_c</math> to the left, so that the resulting signal is located in the baseband. A '''radio frequency upconverter''' is a device that takes an input of [[radio frequency]] energy of a specific [[frequency]] range and outputs it on a higher frequency. Likewise, downconverters take an input frequency and reduce it to a lower output frequency. Both converters are commonly used in [[transverter]]s and satellite communications. Upconverters achieve this frequency conversion via heterodyning, the same principle as modern receivers and transmitters to offset the frequency. === Analog videotape recording === Many analog [[videotape]] systems rely on a downconverted color subcarrier in order to record color information in their limited bandwidth. These systems are referred to as "heterodyne systems" or "color-under systems". For instance, for [[NTSC]] video systems, the [[VHS]] (and [[S-VHS]]) recording system converts the color subcarrier from the NTSC standard 3.58 MHz to ~629 kHz.<ref name = lionlamb>[http://www.lionlmb.org/quad/format.html#12incomposite Videotape formats using {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} tape] ; Retrieved 2007-01-01</ref> [[PAL]] VHS color subcarrier is similarly downconverted (but from 4.43 MHz). The now-obsolete 3/4" [[U-matic]] systems use a heterodyned ~688 kHz subcarrier for NTSC recordings (as does [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]], which is at its basis a 1/2" consumer version of U-matic), while PAL U-matic decks came in two mutually incompatible varieties, with different subcarrier frequencies, known as Hi-Band and Low-Band. Other videotape formats with heterodyne color systems include [[Video-8]] and [[Hi8]].<ref name = poynton>Poynton, Charles. ''Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces'' San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2003 PP 582, 583 ISBN 1-55860-792-7</ref> The heterodyne system in these cases is used to convert quadrature phase-encoded and amplitude modulated sine waves from the broadcast frequencies to frequencies recordable in less than 1 MHz bandwidth. On playback, the recorded color information is heterodyned back to the standard subcarrier frequencies for display on televisions and for interchange with other standard video equipment. Some U-matic (3/4") decks feature 7-pin mini-[[DIN connector]]s to allow dubbing of tapes without a heterodyne up-conversion and down-conversion, as do some industrial VHS, S-VHS, and Hi8 recorders. === Music synthesis === The [[theremin]], an [[electronic musical instrument]], uses the heterodyne principle to produce a variable [[audio frequency]] in response to the movement of the [[musician]]'s hands in the vicinity of some [[antenna (radio)|antennas]]. The output of a fixed radio frequency oscillator is mixed with that of an oscillator whose frequency is affected by the [[variable
