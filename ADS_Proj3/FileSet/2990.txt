are labeled as &Sigma;<sup>+</sup> or &Sigma;<sup>&minus;</sup>. ==Reflection through an inversion center: u and g symmetry== Taking the molecule center of mass as origin of coordinates, consider the change of all electrons' position from (''x<sub>i</sub>'', ''y<sub>i</sub>'', ''z<sub>i</sub>'') to (&minus;''x<sub>i</sub>'', &minus;''y<sub>i</sub>'', &minus;''z<sub>i</sub>''). If the resulting wave function is unchanged, it is said to be ''gerade'' (German for even); if the wave function changes sign then it is said to be ''ungerade'' (odd). For a molecule with a center of inversion, all orbitals will be symmetric or antisymmetric. The resulting wavefunction for the whole multielectron system will be ''gerade'' if an even number of electrons is in ''ungerade'' orbitals, and ''ungerade'' if there is an odd number of electrons in ''ungerade'' orbitals, independently of the number of electrons in ''gerade'' orbitals. ==Alternative empirical notation== Electronic states are also often identified by an empirical single-letter label. The ground state is labelled X, excited states of the same multiplicity (i.e., having the same spin quantum number) are labelled in ascending order of energy with capital letters A,B,C...; excited states having different multiplicity than the ground state are labelled with lower-case letters a,b,c... In polyatomic molecules (but not in diatomic) it is customary to add a tilde (e.g. X<sup>~</sup>, a<sup>~</sup>) to these empirical labels to prevent possible confusion with symmetry labels based on group representations. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Molecular physics]] [[Category:Quantum chemistry]] [[Category:Atomic physics]] [[Category:Spectroscopy]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24973</id> <title>Molecule editor</title> <text>A '''molecule editor''' is a [[computer program]] for creating and modifying representations of [[chemical structure]]s. There are a number of types of molecule editor. Molecular drawing programs are used to generate [[2D geometric model|two-dimensional]] (flat) representations of [[molecule]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s that can be used as illustrations or for querying [[chemical database]]s. [[3-D computer graphics|Three-dimensional]] molecule editors are used to build molecular models, usually as part of [[molecular modelling]] software packages. Database molecular editors such as Leatherface<ref>Kenny, P.W.; Sadowski, J.

Chem.'' 47, 224-232.</ref> allow large numbers of molecules to be modified automatically according to rules such as 'deprotonate carboxylic acids' or 'break exocyclic bonds' that can be specified by the user. Most molecule editors use [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[file format]]s, but most can read and write several file formats, including [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]], a short [[ASCII]]-representation of molecules. Files generated by two- or three-dimensional molecule editors can also be displayed by [[molecular graphics]] tools, which can be realized as a small [[applet]] to show molecules in web pages. == Standalone programs == {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
