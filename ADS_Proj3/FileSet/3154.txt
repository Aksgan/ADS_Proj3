This device may be either a general-purpose computer running [[computer software|software]] to perform the network emulation or a [[emulator|dedicated emulation device]]. The device incorporates a variety of network attributes into its emulation model – including the round-trip time across the network ([[Lag|latency]]), the amount of available [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], a given degree of [[packet loss]], duplication of packets, reordering packets, and/or the severity of network [[jitter]]. Desktop PCs can be connected to the emulated environment, so that users can experience the performance and behavior of applications in that environment first-hand. Similarly, phones can be connected to the emulated environment so that users can directly assess [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] call quality for themselves. ==Emulation, simulation and traffic generation== Emulation differs from [[simulation]] in that a network emulator appears to ''be'' a network; end-systems such as [[computer]]s can be attached to the emulator and will behave as if they are attached to a network. Network simulators are typically programs which run on a single computer, take an abstract description of the network traffic (such as a flow arrival process) and yield performance statistics (such as buffer occupancy as a function of time). A network emulator emulates the network which connects end-systems, not the end-systems themselves. Systems which emulate the end-systems are called [[traffic generator]]s. == Free software == * [[ns (simulator)|NS-2]] is a popular network simulator that can also be used as a limited-functionality emulator. It is currently maintained. ==See also== * [[Netflow]] * [[Network simulator]] * [[Network simulation]] * [[Network traffic simulation]] * [[Traffic generation model]] * [[Packet flow]] [[Category:Network architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26198</id> <title>Network intelligence</title> <text>'''Network Intelligence (NI)''' is a technology that builds on the concepts and capabilities of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI), [[Packet_capture|Packet Capture]] and [[Business Intelligence]] (BI). It examines, in real time, [[Packet_(information_technology)|IP data packets]] that cross [[Telecommunications_network|communications networks]] by identifying the [[Communications_protocols|protocols]] used and extracting packet content and [[metadata]] for rapid analysis of data relationships and communications patterns. NI is used as a middleware to capture and feed information to network operator applications for [[bandwidth management]], [[traffic shaping]], policy management, [[Convergent_charging|charging and billing]] (including usage-based and content billing), [[service assurance]], [[revenue assurance]], market research mega panel analytics, [[lawful interception]] and cyber security. It is currently being incorporated into a wide range of applications by vendors who provide technology solutions to [[Communications_service_provider|Communications Service Providers (CSPs)]], governments and large enterprises. NI extends network controls, business capabilities, security functions and data mining for new products and services needed since the emergence of [[Web 2.0]] and wireless [[3G]] and [[4G]] technologies.<ref name=partridge/><ref name=bechetoile/><ref name=sherrington/> == Background == The evolution and growth of [[Internet]] and [[wireless]] technologies offer possibilities for new types of products and services,<ref name=sherrington/><ref name=kishore/> as well as opportunities for hackers and criminals to exploit weaknesses and perpetrate [[Computer_crime|cyber crime]]<ref name=dee/><ref name=messagelabs/>. [[Network_management|Network optimization]] and [[Network_security|security]] solutions therefore need to address the exponential increases in IP traffic, methods of access, types of activity and volume of content generated.<ref name=ironport/><ref name=golson/> Traditional DPI tools from established vendors like [[Sandvine]] and [[Allot]] have historically addressed specific network infrastructure applications such as [[bandwidth management]], [[Network_performance|performance optimization]] and [[Quality of Service]] (QoS). DPI focuses on recognizing different types of IP traffic as part of a CSP’s infrastructure. NI provides more granular analysis. It enables vendors to create an information layer with metadata from IP traffic to feed multiple applications for more detailed and expansive visibility into network-based activity. NI technology goes beyond traditional DPI, since it not only recognizes protocols but also extracts a wide range of valuable metadata. NI’s value-add to solutions traditionally based on DPI has attracted the attention of industry analysts who specialize in DPI market research. For example, [http://www.heavyreading.com Heavy Reading] now includes NI companies on its Deep Packet Inspection Semi-Annual Market Tracker.<ref name=sherrington/> == Business Intelligence for data networks == In much the same way that BI technology synthesizes business application data from a variety of sources for business visibility and better decision-making, NI technology correlates network traffic data from a variety of data communication vehicles for network visibility, enabling better cyber security and IP services. With ongoing changes in communications networks and how information can be exchanged, people are no longer linked exclusively to physical subscriber lines. The same person can communicate in multiple ways – [[File_Transfer_Protocol|FTP]], [[Webmail]], [[Voice_over_Internet_Protocol|VoIP]], [[instant messaging]], [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[Social_network_service|social networks]] – and from different access points via desktops, laptops and mobile devices. NI provides the means to quickly identify, examine and correlate interactions involving Internet users, applications, and protocols whether or not the protocols are [[Tunnelling_protocol|tunneled]] or follow the [[OSI model]]. The technology enables a global understanding of network traffic for applications that need to correlate information such as who contacts whom, when, where and how, or who accesses
