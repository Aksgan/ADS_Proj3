National Statistics"''], 10 Downing Street press notice, 4 August 2005, retrieved 9 June 2007.</ref>, then [[Jil Matheson]] in September 2009. Following the implementation of the Statistics & Registration Service Act, the [[General Register Office]] continues to be part of a ministerially-accountable department and became a part of the [[Home Office]]. The title of [[Registrar-General]] moved with it and is no longer held by the National Statistician. == Work of the ONS == Where data is broken down by geographical area, this is usually done by the areas defined in the [[ONS coding system|ONS geographical coding system]]. === Data collection === The principal areas of data collection include: * Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry * Commerce, Energy and Industry * Crime and Justice * Economy * Education and Training * Health and Care: this includes numerous regular surveys, such as the [[General Household Survey]], the [[Labour Force Survey]] and the [[Census in the United Kingdom|UK National Census]] that takes place every 10 years. ONS also runs the [[England and Wales Longitudinal Survey]], which monitors the health, address changes and fertility of a 1% sample of the population of England and Wales over time for statistical purposes). * Labour Market * Natural and Built Environment * Population and Migration * Public Sector and Other * Social and Welfare * Transport, Travel and Tourism Statisticians are also employed by many other Government departments and agencies, and these statisticians often collect and publish data. They are members of the ''Government Statistical Service'' and are the professional responsibility of the head of the service, who is also the National Statistician. Each department has a statistical service ''Head of Profession''. For example, data on Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry comes primarily from the [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. Along with economic data on which the Treasury and Bank of England rely for decision-making, many of the statistics that receive widespread media attention are issued by the Home Office, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], and the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]]. ONS is also responsible for the maintenance of the ''Inter-Departmerntal Business Register'' and the ''Business Structure Database''.<ref>[http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file51198.pdf]</ref> === Former departments === Prior to the establishment of the [[UK Statistics Authority]], the statistical work of ONS, since June 2000, was scrutinized by the [[Statistics Commission]], an independent body with its own chairman and small staff. This ceased to operate from 1 April 2008. The [[General Register Office]] and the post of [[Registrar-General]] for England & Wales ceased to be part of ONS from that date but remains subject to ministerial accountability within the [[Home Office]]. === The Blue Book === Annually, the Office for National Statistics publish their findings in the so-called ''Blue Book''. It contains the estimates of the domestic and national product, income and expenditure of the United Kingdom, and is available as hardcopy, as well as a web version.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/BlueBook2006.pdf United Kingdom National Accounts] - The Blue Book 2006</ref> === Education of Statisticians === The Office for National Statistics collaborates with the [[University of Southampton]] in the teaching of a MSc in Official Statistics, the programme has been in running since 2003.<ref>[http://www.socstats.soton.ac.uk/moffstat/ MSc in Official Statistics, University of Southampton.]</ref> == Office Locations == [[Image:ONS.JPG|thumb|ONS London office, 1 Drummond Gate]] The ONS has a head office in the city of [[Newport]], South Wales, and other offices in [[Islington]] in [[London]] and [[Titchfield]] in [[Hampshire]].<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about_ns/locations/onsmaps.asp Office for National Statistics: location maps], www.statistics.gov.uk, retrieved 10 June 2007.</ref> The [[Family Records Centre]] in Myddelton Street in [[Islington]],<ref name="autogenerated1" /> London, moved to the National Archives in Kew during the first half of 2008, with the building taken over by staff vacating the Pimlico site (1 Drummond Gate). === Former Headquarters === The London (Pimlico) office was the head office until April 2006 when the corporate headquarters was moved to Newport<ref>[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/imagelibrary/downloadMedia.asp?MediaDetailsID=77252 ''"Newport to be ONS headquarters"''], National Statistics news release, 20 September 2004, retrieved 9 June 2007.</ref> following the Lyons Review<ref>[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consultations_and_legislation/lyons/consult_lyons_index.cfm#final ''"The Lyons Review: Independent Review of public sector relocation"''], HM Treasury website.</ref> on public sector relocation. Initially, the London office was in three buildings but due to reductions, London staff are now in Myddelton Street. This London office is expected to house few staff by April 2010 by which time the ONS policy is for its statistical activities to be concentrated in Titchfield and Newport<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6267087.stm ''"ONS set to close down London HQ"''], news report from the BBC website.</ref> === Gradual move of functions to South Wales === The ONS asserts that recruitment and training of quality staff in South Wales, where data collection and analysis already takes place, will ensure that there is no risk to the quality of its services and that it is managing the risks associated with the changes which it is implementing in a planned and gradual way.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6653771.stm ''"Stats staff 'quitting' over move"''], news report from the BBC website, 14 May 2007.</ref> However the plan to discontinue all remaining statistical activity in London is proving controversial amid claims that the shift of functions from London and the impending closure of the London office could have serious implications for the future of certain particular sets of statistics. These include health statistics, National Accounts, Retail and Consumer Prices and Labour Market Statistics. These risks derive from the fact that few of the experienced staff working in these highly technical areas are expected to be willing to relocate to Newport, resulting in a substantial loss of expertise and a consequent threat to the continued quality of the statistics.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70424-0007.htm Debate on the Statistics and Registration Service Bill] in the House of Lords, 24 April 2007, Hansard, Column 597.</ref> In a submission to the Parliamentary Treasury Sub Committee, the Bank of England too has expressed concern over the relocation of the ONS to [[Newport]], saying, that ''"the relocation programme poses serious risks to the maintenance of the quality of macroeconomic data.
