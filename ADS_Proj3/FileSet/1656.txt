Gemalto Chairman Alex Mandl said of the merger, “Thanks to this merger, we have assembled the skills and the scale to fully serve three important markets: mobile telecom, secure transactions and security.” <ref name=multiple/> With the merger, the two former smart card companies set out to achieve a new, broader vision for Gemalto—to be the world’s leading digital security company. Gemalto CEO Olivier Piou explained the term “digital security” and Gemalto’s vision in a 2008 interview: “Digital security has a key role to play in the ‘digital revolution’– a major trend already bringing huge benefits to developed countries, and being enthusiastically adopted by emerging nations. Yet fear of fraud, identity theft and other concerns are holding people back from making the most of these opportunities. They need to feel that the wealth of devices and services on offer are both convenient to use and trustworthy. So convenience and trust are at the core of our vision of digital security. Developments in all our key markets show how well received they are… We are continuously expanding the possibilities of secure digital technology with new services and new products, and winning meaningful contracts in all segments and geographies.” <ref name=multiple/> == Corporate Structure == Since 2006, Gemalto comprises three market-focused global divisions—[[Telecommunication]]s, Secure Transactions and [[Security]], as well as functional organizations for marketing; operations including both production and research and development; finance; human resources and legal. == Telecommunications == Gemalto provides software solutions, Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs)and managed services to more than 700 million subscribers in the telecommunications market.
