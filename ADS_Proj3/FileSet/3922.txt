implemented in humans, success has been achieved in sampling usable video signals from the biological eyes of a living [[horseshoe crab]] through their optic nerves, and in sending video signals from electronic cameras into the creatures' brains using the same method.

Usually this is a digital image taken by the host operating system or software running on the computer, but it can also be a capture made by a [[camera]] or a device intercepting the video output of the display (such as a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]). Screenshots can be used to demonstrate a program, a particular problem a user might be having or generally when display output needs to be shown to others or archived. == Built-in screenshot functionality == === Mac OS X === On [[Mac OS X]], a user can take a screenshot of an entire screen by pressing [[Command key|Command]]-[[Shift key|Shift]]-3, or of a chosen area of the screen by [[Command key|Command]]-[[Shift key|Shift]]-4. This screenshot is saved to the user's desktop, with one [[PNG]] file per attached monitor. A provided application called Grab (located in /Applications/Utilities) will capture a chosen area, a whole window, the whole screen, or the whole screen after 10 seconds (allowing you to 'pose' your mouse actions), and pops the screenshot up in a window ready for copying to the [[clipboard]] or saving as a [[TIFF]]. A shell utility called "screencapture" (located in <code>/usr/sbin/screencapture</code>) can be used from the Terminal application or in shell scripts to capture screenshots and save them to files. Various options are available to choose the file format of the screenshot, how the screenshot is captured, if sounds are played, etc. This utility might only be available when the Mac OS X developer tools are installed. A user cannot capture the screen while [[DVD Player (software)|DVD Player]] is running. === Microsoft Windows === On [[Microsoft Windows]], pressing {{keypress|[[Print Screen]]}} captures a screenshot of the entire desktop and places it in the [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]], while {{keypress|Alt}}+{{keypress|Print Screen}} captures only the [[active window]]. In most versions of Windows, captured screenshots do not include the mouse pointer. Once captured, the screenshot must be pasted from the clipboard into a separate program, such as [[Microsoft Paint|Paint]] or [[Microsoft Word|Word]], in order to be viewed or saved. Some programs, however, particularly multiplayer online games, will automatically save screenshots in a specified folder. As of [[Windows XP]] (or any version based on [[Windows NT]]), it is no longer possible to take screenshots of full-screen DOS windows without other software. Video content in programs using a [[hardware overlay]] video renderer is not captured by the method described above.<ref>[http://www.screenvirtuoso.com/overlays.html Hardware Overlays Knowledge Base]</ref> [[Windows Media Player]] on Windows XP in its default configuration on supported hardware is affected by this. However, some third-party applications can capture overlay images. [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] include a utility called [[Snipping Tool]], first introduced in [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]]. It is a screen-capture tool, that allows for taking screenshots (called snips) of windows, rectangular areas, or a free-form area. Snips can then be annotated, saved as an image file or as an HTML page, or emailed. However, it does not work with non-tablet XP versions but represents an XP compatible equivalent. [[Windows 7]] also provides a "problem steps recorder" ([http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-use-Problem-Steps-Recorder psr]). This will record a screenshot every time you click on your screen. When stopped it creates a [[Zip_(file format)|zip]]ped MHTML document with all the screenshots inside. For programmatic access, application developers can use [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]], [[DirectX]] or the [[Windows Media Encoder]] [[Application programming interface|API]] to capture the screen.<ref>http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dialog/screencap.aspx Various methods for capturing the screen</ref> === iOS === A screenshot can be taken with the [[iPhone OS]] by pressing and holding the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button; the screen will flash and the picture will be stored in PNG format in the "Camera Roll" on the [[iPhone]] or in "Saved Photos" on the [[iPod touch]]. The screenshot feature is only available with iPhone OS 2.0 and later. === Palm WebOS === Screenshots of the [[Palm WebOS]] can be taken by simultaneously pressing "Orange Key + Sym + P". Screenshots will be saved to your "Screen captures" folder in the "Photos" app. === Maemo 5 === On [[Maemo#Maemo 5|Maemo 5]] a screenshot can be taken by pressing "Ctrl + Shift + P" simultaneously. Screenshots will be saved as "Screenshot-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.png" in "Images/Screenshots" on the internal storage. === X Window System === [[Image:Gnome-screenshot on Ubuntu.png|thumb|[[gnome-screenshot]]]] Since [[X Window System]] itself is not a desktop environment and only includes a very basic set of programs, methods of taking screenshots vary greatly on the platform. While <tt>xwd(1)</tt> is the closest "standard" way to do it in the X Window System, most people use other bundled utilities to achieve the task due to their ease of use. *'''[[xwd]]''' On systems running the X Window System the standard utility to dump an image of an X Window is <tt>xwd(1)</tt>, xwd produces an XWD image. * '''import''' is a command line tool that is part of the [[ImageMagick]] suite, and captures screenshots in a variety of formats. *'''[[KSnapshot]]''' is the default screen grabbing utility in the [[KDE|K Desktop Environment]]. *'''[[gnome-screenshot]]''' is the default screen grabbing utility in [[GNOME]]. *'''[[Shutter_(Software)|Shutter]]''' is a feature-rich screenshot program. Additionally, using KDE or GNOME the [[Print screen|Print Screen]] key behaviour is quite the same as it is on Windows. It is very easy to take screenshots with the image editing program GIMP, if it is available. == Third party tools == === Microsoft Windows === * [[Greenshot]] - Freeware
