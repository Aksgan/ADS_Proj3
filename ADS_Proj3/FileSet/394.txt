about our own behavior resulting in the abandonment of norms, restraints and inhibitions. Deindividuation involves a loss of self-awareness which is essentially the degree to which one’s attention is focused on the self, resulting in comparisons against meaningful standards. When spectators’ become deindividuated, their self-awareness plummets and they cease comparing their behavior against these standards, the consequence being increased responsively to situational forces. Without the comparison process of self-awareness, people’s behavior is more likely to be inconsistent with their attitudes. ==See also== [[Chindia]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Basking In Reflected Glory}} [[Category:Cognition]] [[pl:BIRG]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3441</id> <title>BassOmatic</title> <text>{{About|the cipher|the band|Bassomatic (band)}} {{Infobox block cipher | name = BassOmatic | image = | caption = | designers = [[Phil Zimmermann]] | publish date = 1991 | derived from = | derived to = | related to = | key size = 8 to 2048 bits | block size = 2048 bits | structure = | rounds = 1&ndash;8 | cryptanalysis = }} In [[cryptography]], '''BassOmatic''' was the [[symmetric-key cipher]] designed by [[Phil Zimmermann]] as part of his email encryption software, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] (in the first release, version 1.0).

The name is explained in this comment from the source code: "BassOmatic gets its name from an old [[Dan Aykroyd]] [[Saturday Night Live]] skit involving a blender and a whole fish. The BassOmatic algorithm does to data what the original BassOmatic did to the fish." ==Algorithm== The algorithm operates on blocks of 256 bytes (or 2048 bits). The actual [[key size]] can be anywhere from 8 to 2048 bits. The 6 least-significant bits of the [[key (cryptography)|key]] are ''control bits'', used to choose between several possible variations. The number of rounds is 1 to 8, depending on the 3 lowest control bits. Bit 4 selects between two possible [[key schedule]]s: one using the key to seed a [[pseudorandom number generator]], the other using BassOmatic itself. Making such variations key-dependent means some keys must be [[weak key|weaker]] than others; the [[key space]] is not ''flat''. The chosen key schedule produces a total of 8 ''permutation tables'', each a [[permutation]] of the numbers 0 to 255. Each round consists of 4 operations: [[XOR]]ing the block with one of the permutation tables, ''shredding'' or permuting individual bits throughout the block, an unkeyed [[confusion and diffusion|diffusion]] called ''raking'', and a substitution step using the permutation tables as [[substitution box|S-box]]es. The shredding step can either permute all 8 [[bit-plane]]s independently, or in groups of 4, depending on control bit 3. The permutation tables stay the same through all rounds of encryption on a given block, but if control bit 5 is set, then the tables are regenerated after each block. ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.pgpkeys.org/software.html PGPkeys.org] - downloads of older PGP software, including version 1.0 source {{Crypto navbox | block}} [[Category:Broken block ciphers]] {{crypto-stub}} [[it:BassOmatic]] [[ru:BassOmatic]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3454</id> <title>Battenberg Course Indicator</title> <text>The '''Battenberg Course Indicator''' is a mechanical calculating device invented by [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] in 1892 for determining the relative course and speed of other vessels compared to the user's own ship. A number of versions of the device were produced and it proved particularly useful for station keeping, such as ships moving in convoy during World War II. Manufacture of the instruments was contracted to Elliott Brothers, London.<ref name=MkIV/> Devices based on the Battenberg indicator were also developed for determining course and distance in aviation and when making allowances for aircraft drift due to winds. Instruments were also manufactured for other navies, for example in the USA. ==Mark III== The Mark III instrument had two position bars and guide bar. <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/searchbin/searchs.pl?exhibit=it1684z&axis=1182796833&flash= |title=Battenberg Course Indicatror (MarkIII)|publisher=National Maritime Museum|accessdate=2008-11-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ==Mark IV== Similar to Mark III. The circular scale attached to the end of the 'own ship' bar was moved to be part of the pivot assembly, so that it is fixed relative to the 'guide bar' instead of being fixed relative to the 'own ship' bar. The 'own ship' bar was redesigned with a ponter on the end to read off the scale.<ref name=MkIV>{{cite web | url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ou5274.htm| title=Battenberg course indicator Mark IV Instructions|accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> ==Mark V== The mark V instrument dispensed with the guide bar and own ship's bar, retaining only the two position bars. However the circular base plate was added to by the provision of two celluloid transparent discs which were placed on top of the base and free to rotate. The instrument body was made in an aluminium alloy, and had a scale graded in degrees around the outside. The base plate had no scale, but a series of interrupted parallel lines running across it. This device was in production around 1955. One disc was marked with a scale from 0 at the centre to 36 on the outside, in a similar manner to the markings originally etched onto the base plate, except that three marked scales were used, one in a line through the centre and another parallel but half way to the edge either side of the centre line. The markings were then repeated by a second set at right angles to the first. Depending on usage, the marked scale numbers could refer to distance or speed. A second disc was marked with a circular scale all around the edge labelled in degrees, with radial lines from the centre of the disc stretching out every ten degrees. The disc also had concentric circles which
