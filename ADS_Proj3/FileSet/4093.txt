of social facts arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors. He distinguished between a traditional society – "mechanical solidarity" – which prevails if individual differences are minimized, and the modern society – "organic solidarity" – that develops out of cooperation between differentiated individuals with independent roles. [[Georg Simmel]], writing at the turn of the twentieth century, was the first scholar to think directly in social network terms. His essays pointed to the nature of network size on interaction and to the likelihood of interaction in ramified, loosely-knit networks rather than groups (Simmel, 1908/1971). After a hiatus in the first decades of the twentieth century, three main traditions in social networks appeared. In the 1930s, [[Jacob L. Moreno|J.L. Moreno]] pioneered the systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups ([[sociometry]]), while a [[Harvard]] group led by [[W. Lloyd Warner]] and [[Elton Mayo]] explored interpersonal relations at work. In 1940, A.R. [[Radcliffe-Brown]]'s presidential address to British anthropologists urged the systematic study of networks.<ref>A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, "On Social Structure," ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute:'' 70 (1940): 1–12.</ref> However, it took about 15 years before this call was followed-up systematically. Social network analysis developed with the kinship studies of Elizabeth Bott in [[England]] in the 1950s and the 1950s–1960s [[urbanization]] studies of the [[University of Manchester]] group of anthropologists (centered around [[Max Gluckman]] and later [[J. Clyde Mitchell]]) investigating community networks in southern Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Concomitantly, British anthropologist [[Siegfried Frederick Nadel|S.F. Nadel]] codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.<ref>Nadel, SF. 1957. ''The Theory of Social Structure.'' London: Cohen and West.</ref> In the 1960s-1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group was centered around [[Harrison White]] and his students at the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Harvard University Department of Social Relations]]: Ivan Chase, Bonnie Erickson, Harriet Friedmann, [[Mark Granovetter]], Nancy Howell, Joel Levine, Nicholas Mullins, John Padgett, [[Michael Schwartz (sociologist)|Michael Schwartz]] and [[Barry Wellman]]. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were Charles Tilly, who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and Stanley Milgram, who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.<ref>[http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman]</ref> [[Mark Granovetter]] and [[Barry Wellman]] are among the former students of White who have elaborated and popularized social network analysis.<ref>Mullins, Nicholas.

Kimball Romney]] and [[Douglas White]]; quantitative analysts at the [[University of Chicago]], including Joseph Galaskiewicz, Wendy Griswold, Edward Laumann, Peter Marsden, Martina Morris, and John Padgett; and communication scholars at [[Michigan State University]], including [[Nan Lin]] and [[Everett Rogers]]. A substantively-oriented [[University of Toronto]] sociology group developed in the 1970s, centered on former students of Harrison White: S.D. Berkowitz, Harriet Friedmann, Nancy Leslie Howard, Nancy Howell, Lorne Tepperman and [[Barry Wellman]], and also including noted modeler and [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Anatol Rapoport]].In terms of theory, it critiqued methodological individualism and group-based analyses, arguing that seeing the world as social networks offered more analytic leverage.<ref>Mark Granovetter, "Introduction for the French Reader," ''Sociologica'' 2 (2007): 1–8; Wellman, Barry. 1988.

The evolution of social networks can sometimes be modeled by the use of agent based models, providing insight into the interplay between communication rules, [[rumor]] spreading and social structure. SNA may also be an effective tool for [[mass surveillance]] – for example the [[Total Information Awareness]] program was doing in-depth research on strategies to [[Surveillance#Social Network Analysis|analyze social networks]] to determine whether or not U.S. citizens were political threats. [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory explores social networks and their role in influencing the spread of new ideas and practices. Change agents and [[opinion leader]]s often play major roles in spurring the adoption of innovations, although factors inherent to the innovations also play a role. [[Robin Dunbar]] has suggested that the typical size of an egocentric network is constrained to about 150 members due to possible limits in the capacity of the human communication channel. The rule arises from cross-cultural studies in [[sociology]] and especially [[anthropology]] of the maximum size of a [[village]] (in modern parlance most reasonably understood as an ''[[ecovillage]]''). It is theorized in [[evolutionary psychology]] that the [[Dunbar's number|number]] may be some kind of limit of average human ability to [[Recognition of human individuals|recognize]] members and track emotional facts about all members of a group. However, it may be due to [[economics]] and the need to track "[[free rider problem|free riders]]", as it may be easier in larger groups to take advantage of the benefits of living in a community without contributing to those benefits. [[Mark Granovetter]] found in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation. [[Clique]]s have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This [[homophily|homophilic]] tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together
