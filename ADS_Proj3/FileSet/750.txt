A cognitive description specifies what kinds of information is input to a cognitive action, how this information is processed and transformed, what data structures are used and what behaviour is generated.<ref>[[John Tooby|Tooby, John]] and [[Leda Cosmides|Cosmides, Leda]] 1992 ''The Psychological Foundations of Culture'', in Barkow, Jerome H., Cosmides, Leda, Tooby, John, (1992) ''[[The Adapted Mind]]: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture,'' Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-506023-7, page 64.</ref> ==See also== {{Portal|Thinking}} [[Cognitive module]] ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Behavioural sciences]] [[Category:Cognition]] [[Category:Cognitive science]] [[Category:Evolutionary psychology]] [[Category:Ethology]] [[Category:Linguistics]] [[Category:Philosophy of mind]] [[Category:Semantics]] {{Philosophy-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>6758</id> <title>Cognitive inertia</title> <text>{{orphan|date=September 2009}} '''Cognitive inertia''' refers the tendency for [[beliefs]] or sets of beliefs to endure once formed. In particular, cognitive inertia describes the [[human behavior|human]] inclination to rely on familiar assumptions and exhibit a reluctance and/or inability to revise those assumptions, even when the evidence supporting them no longer exists or when other evidence would question their accuracy. The term is employed in the [[organizational studies|managerial and organizational sciences]] to describe the commonly observed phenomenon whereby managers fail to update and revise their understanding of a situation when that situation changes, a phenomenon that acts as a psychological barrier to organizational change.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/smj.4250131006 |author=Huff J.O., Huff A.S., Thomas H. |title=Strategic Renewal and the Interaction of Cumulative Stress and Inertia |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume=13 |issue= |pages=55–75 |year=1992 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-6486.00078 |author=Hodgkinson G.P. |title=Cognitive inertia in a turbulent market: The case of UK residential [[estate agent]]s |journal=Journal of Management Studies |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=921–945 |year=1997 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1287/orsc.7.1.22 |author=Reger R.K., Palmer T.B. |title=Managerial categorization of competitors: Using old maps to navigate new environments |journal=Organization Science |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=22–39 |year=1996 }}</ref> The notion of cognitive inertia is related to similar ideas in the fields of [[social psychology]] and [[behavioral economics|behavioral decision theory]], including [[cognitive dissonance]], [[belief perseverance]], [[confirmation bias]], and [[escalation of commitment]]. One example of cognitive inertia concerns managers at the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid corporation]], whose belief that the company could not make money on hardware but only on consumables led them to neglect the growth in [[digital imaging]] technologies; because the trend was denied by the prevailing "mental model" of the business, the corporation failed to adapt effectively to market changes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/11<1147::AID-SMJ128>3.0.CO;2-R |author=Tripsas M., Gavetti G. |title=Capabilities, cognition, and inertia: Evidence from digital imaging |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume=21 |issue=10-11 |pages=1147–61 |year=2000 }}</ref> Not all instances of cognitive inertia result in negative outcomes. Cognitive inertia is a key component of [[love]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[friendship]]. For instance, if evidence showed that a friend was [[dishonesty|dishonest]], the cognitive inertia of the friendship would demand much more evidence to form an opinion than that required to form an opinion of a stranger. In this fashion, cognitive inertia provides an additional level of trust in a relationship. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Cognitive psychology]] [[Category:Heuristics]] [[Category:Business]] [[Category:Management]] [[Category:Decision theory]] {{psych-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>6761</id> <title>Cognitive map</title> <text>{{merge|Mental mapping|discuss=Talk:Cognitive map#Merger proposal|date=September 2009}} '''Cognitive maps''' (also known as mental maps, [[mind map]]s, cognitive models, or [[mental model]]s) are a type of [[cognition|mental processing]] composed of a series of psychological transformations by which an individual can acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their everyday or metaphorical spatial environment. The credit for the creation of this term is given to [[Edward C.

As a consequence, these mental models are often referred to, variously, as cognitive maps, mental maps, scripts, schemata, and [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]]. Putting it into simpler terms, cognitive maps are a method we use to construct and accumulate spatial knowledge, allowing the "[[mind's eye]]" to visualize images in order to reduce [[cognitive load]], enhance [[recollection|recall]] and [[learning]] of information. This type of spatial thinking can also be used as a metaphor for non-spatial tasks, where people performing non-spatial tasks involving [[memory]] and imaging use spatial knowledge to aid in processing the task.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kitchin RM | title=Cognitive Maps: What Are They and Why Study Them? | journal=[[Journal of Environmental Psychology]] | year=1994 | volume=14 | pages=1–19 | doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80194-X}}</ref> The oldest known formal method of using spatial locations to remember data is the "[[method of loci]]". This method was originally used by students of [[rhetoric]] in [[ancient Rome]] when memorizing speeches. To use it one must first memorize the appearance of a physical location (for example, the sequence of rooms in a building). When a list of words, for example, needs to be memorized, the learner visualizes an object representing that word in one of the pre-memorized locations. To recall the list, the learner mentally "walks through" the memorized locations, noticing the objects placed there during the memorization phase.<ref>{{cite book | author=Downs, Roger; Stea, David | title=Image and Environment: Cognitive Mapping and Spatial Behavior | year=1973 | publisher= Edward Arnold|isbn= 978-0202307664 | oclc= 7690182}}</ref> The [[neural correlate]]s of a cognitive map have been speculated to be the [[place cell]] system in the [[hippocampus]]<ref>{{cite book | author=O'Keefe J, Nadel L | title=The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map | year=1978 |url=http://www.cognitivemap.net/}}</ref> and the recently discovered [[grid cells]] in the [[entorhinal cortex]].<ref name="pmid16675704">{{cite journal |author=Sargolini F, Fyhn M, Hafting T, McNaughton BL, Witter MP, Moser MB, Moser EI |title=Conjunctive representation of position, direction, and velocity in entorhinal cortex |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=312 |issue=5774 |pages=758–62 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16675704 |doi=10.1126/science.1125572 |accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> ==Overview== {{Essay-like|section|date=December 2008}} Tolman believed that we learn by trial and error.
