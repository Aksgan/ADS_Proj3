Mordukhovich is one of the founders of modern variational analysis and generalized differentiation. Currently he is Distinguished University Professor and Lifetime Scholar of the Academy of Scholars at [[Wayne State University]]. Mordukhovich was born and educated in the [[Soviet Union]]; he immigrated to the United States with his family in December 1988. Among his best known achievements is the introduction of the most powerful constructions of generalized differentiation (bearing now his name), their development and applications to broad classes of problems in variational analysis, optimization, equilibrium, control, economics, engineering, and other fields.<ref>R.

In an effort to get the new venture set up quickly, Edlund acquired [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s Entertainment Effects Group, taking over their Marina Del Rey facility. ===Competition with ILM=== Boss Film soon established itself as one of the largest competitors to ILM contributing to such projects as ''[[Die Hard]]'', ''[[Poltergeist (film series)|Poltergeist II]]'', and ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. Edlund and his team chose to compete with ILM technically, continuing EEG's preference for using [[70 mm film|65mm]] film for the creation of their optical effects work. This provided potentially cleaner effects than ILM's [[Vistavision|VistaVision]] format due to its much larger negative area. ===Boss Game Studios=== Boss Film branched out into video game production through sister company [[Boss Game Studios]]. Boss Film also operated a commercial production company producing many television spots for products including Budweiser, Dodge, United Airlines and DHL. ===Closure=== Boss Film announced it was closing its doors on August 26, 1997 citing the difficulties of sustaining an independent effects house within the competitive environment at the time. == Awards == Nominated for Best Visual Effects Academy Award 1993 for [[Alien3]]. The named nominees were Richard Edlund; Alec Gillis; Tom Woodruff Jr.; and George Gibbs. Nominated for Best Visual Effects Academy Award 1989 for [[Die Hard]].
