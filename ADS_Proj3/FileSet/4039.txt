ocean surveillance satellites (RORSAT), no longer operational.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} A full constellation of US-PU includes 3-4 spacecraft in LEO of 400 km, but not more than one has been in orbit since 2004, along with two Tselina-2's. A new generation of ELINT satellites, possibly combining the land and sea missions, may be in development. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} ===Spain: Satellite Platforms=== Spain is a financial partner in the French Helios 2 IMINT satellite system. Spain plans a dual-use optical and radar system. Due to the arrangement between France and Germany to exchange Helios 2 and [[SAR Lupe]] imagery, excluding the non-French partners in Helios.<ref name=Wall2007 /> It has not been announced if Spain, as a Helios 2 partner, will have access to French Essaim ELINT. Spain is a MUSIS partner, which should be considered in assessing the potential of information sharing among the partners.<ref name=Wall2007 /> ===United States: Satellite Platforms=== The first US SIGINT satellites, [[GRAB|Galactic Radiation and Background (GRAB)]] were launched in 1960 by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], but the existence of the program was highly classified. The name of the program was changed to [[Poppy (satellite)]] after the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] was created in 1962.

US SIGINT satellites have included the CANYON series [[Rhyolite/Aquacade]] series, succeeded by the [[Magnum (satellite)|Vortex/Magnum/Orion]] and [[Mentor (satellite)|Mentor]]. Where the preceding satellites were in close to geosynchronous orbit, JUMPSEAT/TRUMPET satellites were in Moliyna orbits giving better polar coverage.<ref name=TalinnPSI /> From 1972 to 1989, low earth orbit SIGINT satellites were launched only as secondary payloads with [[KH-9]] and [[KH-11]] IMINT satellites. They were code-named after female sex symbols, such as RAQUEL, FARRAH, BRIDGET and MARILYN. Four geosychronous RHYOLITE satellites were launched in the seventies, with COMINT and TELINT missions. After having the name compromised when [[Christopher Boyce]] sold information to the Soviets, the code name was changed to AQUACADE. In the late seventies, another class of geosynchronous SIGINT satellites, first called CHALET and renamed VORTEX after the code name was compromised. After the loss of Iranian monitoring stations, these satellites were also given a TELINT capability. JUMPSEAT ELINT satellites, using a Moliyna orbit, started launching in 1975. MAGNUM geosynchronous SIGINT satellites were first launched from the Space Shuttle in 1985. These were believed to be more sensitive and perhaps stealthier than RHYOLITE/AQUACADE.<ref name=Richelson1989 /> ==References== {{Reflist| 2}} {{Intelligence cycle management}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Signals Intelligence Operational Platforms By Nation}} [[Category:Applications of cryptography]] [[Category:Intelligence gathering disciplines]] [[Category:Intelligence (information gathering)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34373</id> <title>Signorini problem</title> <text>The '''Signorini problem''' is an [[Linear_elasticity#Elastostatics|elastostatics]] problem in [[linear elasticity]]: it consists in finding the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|elastic equilibrium]] [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|configuration]] of a [[Anisotropy#Material science and engineering|anisotropic]] [[Homogeneous media|non-homogeneous]] [[Physical body|elastic body]], resting on a [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[friction]]less [[surface]] and subject only to its [[Weight|mass force]]s. The name was coined by [[Gaetano Fichera]] to honour his teacher Signorini: the original name coined by him is '''problem with ambiguous [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]'''. == History == [[Image:Classical Signorini problem.svg|thumb|left|400px|The classical Signorini problem: what will be the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|equilibrium]] [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|configuration]] of the orange spherically shaped [[Physical body|elastic body]] resting on the blue [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[friction]]less [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]?]] The problem was posed by [[Antonio Signorini]] during a course of lessons taught at the [[Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica]] in 1959, later published as the paper {{Harv|Signorini|1959}}, expanding a previous short exposition he gave in a note published in 1933. As stated in {{Harv|Signorini|1959|p=128}}, he called it ''problem with ambiguous [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]'' i.e. ''problema con ambigue condizioni al contorno'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], since there are two alternative sets of [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] involving not only [[equality|equalities]] ''but also [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]'' the solution ''must satisfy'' on any given [[Contact (mechanics)|contact point]], but ''it is not [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] known what of the two sets is satisfied for each point'': he posed the question if the problem was or not well posed in a physical sense, i.e. if its solution exist and is unique or not, inviting young [[mathematical analysis|analysts]] to study the problem<ref>As [[Antonio Signorini]] himself writes in {{Harv|Signorini|1959|p=129}}.</ref>. [[Gaetano Fichera]] and [[Mauro Picone]] attended the lessons and Fichera started to investigate the existence and uniqueness of the solutions: since there were no references to a similar problem in the theory of [[boundary value problem]]s<ref> See {{Harvnb|Fichera|1995|p=49}}.</ref>, he decided to deal with it by starting from the [[virtual work principle]]. While the problem was under investigation, Signorini began to suffer serious health problems: nevertheless, he desidered to know the answer to his question before his death. Picone, being tied by a strong friendship with Signorini, began to chase Fichera to find a solution, who, being himself tied to Signorini by similar feelings, perceived the last months of 1962 as worrying days<ref>This dramatic situation is well described by {{Harv|Fichera|1995|p=51}}</ref>. Finally, on the first days of January 1963, Fichera was able to give a complete proof of the existence and uniqueness of a solution for the problem with ambiguous boundary condition, which
