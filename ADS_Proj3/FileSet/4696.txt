It allows the user to start, stop, and view the status of Tor; monitor bandwidth usage; view, filter, and search log messages; and configure some aspects of Tor. Vidalia also makes it easier to contribute to the Tor network by optionally helping the user set up a Tor server. Another prominent feature of Vidalia is its Tor network map, which lets the user see the geographic location of servers on the Tor network, as well as where the user's application traffic is going. Since "Tor" stands for "The Onion Router," it is appropriate that its GUI be named Vidalia (see [[Vidalia onion]]). Vidalia is released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It runs on any platform supported by Qt 4.2, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]] or other [[Unix-like]] variants using the [[X11]] window system. == See also == *[[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] *[[Privoxy]] *[[Qt (framework)|Qt]] *[[Arm_(software)|Anonymizing Relay Monitor (arm)]] {{Portal|Free software}} ==External links== *[http://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en Official Website] [[Category:Internet privacy]] [[Category:Anonymity networks]] [[Category:Network-related software]] [[Category:Software that uses Qt]] {{network-software-stub}} [[de:Vidalia (Tor)]] [[pl:Vidalia (program)]] [[zh:Vidalia]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39405</id> <title>Video In Video Out</title> <text>{{Infobox connector |name=Video In Video Out (VIVO) |type=Analog video connector |image=[[Image:Vivo splitter cable.jpg|250px]] |logo= |caption=A 6-connector VIVO splitter cable.

VIVO is found on high-end [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] and [[NVIDIA]] computer [[video card]]s, sometimes labeled "<small>TV OUT</small>". VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports [[composite video|composite]], [[component video|component]], and [[S-Video]] as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] or [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], typically using a component [[breakout cable]] and an S-Video cable. While component-out operation supports [[HDTV|high-definition]] resolutions, it does not support the [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] standard which would be required for official HDTV support as set out by the [[EICTA]]. [[Image:Vivo card.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A graphics card with VGA, VIVO and DVI outputs]] Some practical uses of VIVO include being able to display multimedia stored on a computer on a TV, and being able to connect a [[DVD player]] or [[video game console]] to a computer while continuing to allow viewing via a TV monitor. VIVO itself, however, can not decode broadcast signals from any source, and so, like HDTV sets without [[ATSC tuner|tuners]] and [[composite monitor]]s, additional equipment is required to be able to show broadcast TV programs. Some manufacturers enable their version of the VIVO port to also transfer sound. == Limitations == The VIVO output on graphics cards is often not used by those who have no need to connect their computer to a TV. Also, there can be issues in software supporting the use of VIVO ports. A computer using VIVO must have software that can handle an input signal. For example, in the case of [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce]] series 6 and 7 video card users this means [http://www.nvidia.com/object/wdm_geforce_4.13.html downloading Nvidia's WDM drivers]. Additionally, On [[Windows XP]] computers that use [[GeForce]] video cards with [[Scalable Link Interface]] (SLI) mode enabled, using a TV to display part of the desktop via VIVO is disabled, just as dual-monitor mode is disabled. Confusingly, however, some distorted images may be visible on a properly-connected VIVO-driven television display at boot-up. == See also == *[[DIN connector]] *[[Mini-DIN connector]] *[[Composite video]] *[[Component video]] *[[YPbPr]] *[[S-Video]] *[[ATI Technologies]] *[[Nvidia]] == External links == *[http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=fr_en&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zebulon.fr%2Fbidouilles%2Fvivo.php Plan of assembly of a cable VIVO] *[http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/svideo2cvideo.html S-video to composite video adapter] {{AVconn}} {{Audio_and_video_interfaces_and_connectors}} [[Category:Analog video connectors]] [[Category:Film and video technology]] [[Category:Audiovisual connectors]] [[Category:DIN]] [[Category:Computer hardware]] [[fr:Video In Video Out]] [[ko:비디오 인 비디오
