as they were read from the drum, as it did each of the additions involved in the multiply, it effectively shifted the operand right, acting as if [[fixed-point arithmetic|the binary point]] was on the left side of the word, as opposed to the right side as most other computers assume. To further reduce costs, the traditional [[front panel]] lights showing internal registers were absent. Instead, Librascope mounted a small [[oscilloscope]] on the [[front panel]]. It displayed the output from the three register read heads, one above the other, allowing the operator to "see" and actually read the bits. Horizontal and vertical size controls let the operator adjust the display to match a plastic overlay engraved with the bit numbers. To read bits the operator counted the up- and down- transitions of the oscilloscope trace. Unlike other machines of its day, internal data was represented in hexadecimal as opposed to octal, but being a very inexpensive machine it used the physical typewriter keys that correspond to positions 10 to 15 in the type basket for the six non-decimal characters (as opposed to a - f) to represent those values, resulting in 0 - 9 f g j k q w, which was remembered using the phrase "FiberGlass Javelins Kill Quite Well". {{Quotation|Specifications *Word Length: 31 Bits, including a sign bit, but excluding a blank spacer bit *Memory Size: 4096 word *Speed: 0.260 milliseconds access time between two adjacent physical words; access times between two adjacent addresses 2.340 milliseconds. *Clock Rate: 120 kHz *Power consumption: 1500 [[Watt]]s *Heat dissipation: 5000 [[BTU/h]] (1465 Watts) *Arithmetic element: Three working registers: C the counter register, R the instruction register and A the accumulator register. *Instruction format: Sixteen instruction using half-word format *Technology: 113 vacuum tubes and 1350 diodes. *Number Produced; 320~493 *First Delivery: September, 1956 *Price: $47,000 *Successor: LGP-21 *Achievements: The LGP-30 was one of the first desk-sized computer offering small scale scientific computing.

First, one snapped the bootstrap paper tape into the console typewriter, a [[Friden Flexowriter]], pressed a lever on the Flexowriter to read an address field and pressed a button on the front panel to transfer the address into a computer register. Then one pressed the lever on the Flexowriter to read the data field and pressed three more buttons on the front panel to store it at the specified address. This process was repeated, maybe 6&ndash;8 times, and one developed a rhythm: burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk. The operator then removed the bootstrap tape, snapped in the tape containing the regular loader, carefully arranging it so it wouldn't jam, and pressed a few more buttons to start up the bootstrap program. Once the regular loader was in, the computer was ready to read in a program tape. The regular loader read a more compact format tape than the bootstrap loader. Each block began with a starting address so the tape could be rewinded and retried if an error occurred. If any mistakes were made in the process, or if the program crashed and damaged the loader program, the process had to be restarted from the beginning.

The new computer had 460 transistors and about 300 diodes. It cost only $16,200, one-third the price of its predecessor. Unfortunately it was also about one-third as fast as the earlier computer. ==RPC 4000== Another, more powerful successor machine, was the General Precision RPC 4000. Similar to the LGP-30, but transistorized, it featured 8,008 32 bit words of memory drum storage. According to [http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL64-r.html BRL Report 1964] it had 500 transistors and 4,500 diodes and sold for $87,500. ==Notable uses== Today, the LGP-30 is remembered as the computer on which [[Mel Kaye]] performed a legendary programming task in machine code, retold by [[Ed Nather]] in the hacker epic ''The Story of Mel'' [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html]. This however is inaccurate: the feat actually took place on a different machine by the same manufacturer, the [[RPC-4000]]. The machine was also used by [[Edward Lorenz]] in his attempt to model changing weather patterns. His discovery that massive differences in forecast could derive from tiny differences in initial data led to him coining the terms ''[[strange attractor]]'' and ''[[butterfly effect]]'', core concepts in [[chaos theory]]. ==See also== *[[IBM 650]] *[[Mel Kaye]] ==External links== *[http://computermuseum.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/dev/lgp30/LGP-30.html Working LGP-30 on display in Stuttgart, Germany] *[http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html LGP-30 description] *[http://wps.com/projects/LGP-21/ LGP-21 description] *[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/137/3523.pdf 1962 advertisement showing both the LGP-30 and RPC-4000] *[http://www.hp9825.com/html/stan_frankel.html Story of Stan P.
