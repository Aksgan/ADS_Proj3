variables, such as the circulating current, the flux within the loop or the macroscopic phase of the superconductor. This interaction then changes some variable of the read-out probe which can be measured using conventional low-noise electronics. The read-out probe is typically the technology aspect that separates the research of different University groups working on flux qubits. Prof. Mooij's group at Delft in the Netherlands<ref>[http://qt.tn.tudelft.nl/research/fluxqubit/ University of Delft - Flux Qubit Website]{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>, along with collaborators, has pioneered flux qubit technology, and were the first to conceive, propose and implement flux qubits as they are known today. The Delft read-out scheme is based on a '''[[SQUID]] loop''' that is inductively coupled to the qubit, the qubit's state influences the critical current of the SQUID. The critical current can then be read-out using ramped measurement currents through the SQUID. Recently the group has used the plasma frequency of the SQUID as the read-out variable. Dr. Il'ichev's group at [[IPHT Jena]] in Germany<ref>[http://www.ipht-jena.de/BEREICH_1/abt13_cryo_electronics/application-data/computing.php University of Jena - Flux Qubit Website]{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> are using '''impedance measurement techniques''' based on the flux qubit influencing the resonant properties of a high quality tank circuit, which, like the Delft group is also inductively coupled to the qubit. In this scheme the qubit's magnetic susceptibility, which is defined by its state, changes the phase angle between the current and voltage when a small A.C. signal is passed into the tank circuit. Recently Prof. Petrashov's group at Royal Holloway <ref>[http://www.rhul.ac.uk/physics/research/postgraduateopportunities/nanophysicsnanotechnology/superconductorfluxqubits.aspx Royal Holloway University of London - Flux Qubit Website ]</ref> are using an '''[[Andreev interferometer]]''' probe to read out flux qubits. This read-out uses the phase influence of a superconductor on the conductance properties of a normal metal. A length of normal metal is connected at either end to either side of the qubit using superconducting leads, the phase across the qubit, which is defined by its state, is translated into the normal metal, the resistance of which is then read-out using low noise resistance measurements. ==References== <references/> *[http://xstructure.inr.ac.ru/x-bin/theme3.py?level=1&index1=165015 Flux qubit on arxiv.org] {{Quantum computing}} [[Category:Quantum information science]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13865</id> <title>Fly-by-wire</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}} {{Infobox aviation |name=Fly-by-wire |image=File:Fly by wire.jpg |caption=Green colored flight control wiring of a test aircraft }} A '''fly-by-wire''' (FBW) system replaces [[aircraft flight control system|manual flight control]] of an aircraft with an [[electronics|electronic]] interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and flight control computers determine how to move the [[actuator]]s at each control surface to provide the ordered response. The fly-by-wire system also allows automatic signals sent by the aircraft's computers to perform functions without the pilot's input, as in systems that automatically help stabilize the aircraft.<ref name="Crane">Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 224. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. ISBN 1-56027-287-2</ref> ==Development== Mechanical and hydro-mechanical [[aircraft flight control systems|flight control systems]] are relatively heavy and require careful routing of flight control cables through the aircraft by systems of pulleys, cranks, tension cables and hydraulic pipes. Both systems often require redundant backup to deal with failures, which again increases weight. Furthermore, both have limited ability to compensate for changing [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] conditions. Dangerous characteristics such as [[stall (flight)|stalling]], spinning and [[pilot-induced oscillation]] (PIO), which depend mainly on the stability and structure of the aircraft concerned rather than the control system itself, can still occur with these systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The term "fly-by-wire" implies a purely electrically-signaled control system. However, it is used in the general sense of computer-configured controls, where a computer system is interposed between the operator and the final control actuators or surfaces. This modifies the manual inputs of the pilot in accordance with control parameters.<ref name=Crane/> [[Side-stick]]s, [[centre stick|center sticks]], or conventional flight [[yoke (aircraft)|control yoke]]s can be used to fly FBW aircraft. While the side-stick offers the advantages of being lighter, mechanically simpler, and unobtrusive, The [[Boeing Company]]'s [[aerospace engineer]]s decided that the lack of visual feedback (none given by side-sticks) is a significant problem, and so they designed conventional control yokes in the [[Boeing 777]] and the brand-new [[Boeing 787]], which is undergoing [[test flight|flight test]]s {{as of|2010|6|lc=on}}. This same approach has been used for the [[Embraer]] 170/190 jets. Most [[Airbus]] [[transport plane|airliners]] are operated with side-sticks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} ===Basic operation=== ====Command==== [[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|Simple [[feedback]] loop]] Fly-by wire systems are by their nature quite complex however their operation can be explained in relatively simple terms. When a pilot moves the control column (or sidestick) a signal is sent to a computer, this is analogous to moving a [[joystick|game controller]], the signal is sent through multiple wires (channels) to ensure that the signal reaches the computer. When there are three channels being used this is known as 'Triplex'. The computer receives the signals, performs a calculation (adds the signal voltages and divides by the number of signals received to find the [[arithmetic mean|mean average]] voltage) and adds another channel. These four 'Quadruplex' signals are then sent to the control surface [[actuator]] and the surface begins to move. [[Potentiometer]]s in the actuator send a signal back to the computer (usually a negative voltage) reporting the position of the actuator. When the actuator reaches the desired position the two signals (incoming and outgoing) cancel each other out and the actuator stops moving (completing a [[feedback]] loop).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ====Automatic Stability Systems==== Fly-by-wire control systems allow aircraft computers to perform tasks without pilot input. Automatic stability systems operate in this way. [[Gyroscope]]s fitted with [[sensor]]s are mounted in an aircraft to sense movement changes in the [[flight dynamics (aircraft)|pitch, roll and yaw axes]]. Any movement (from straight and level flight for example) results in signals to the computer, which automatically moves control actuators to stabilize the aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ===Safety and redundancy=== Aircraft systems may be quadruplexed (four independent channels) to prevent loss of signals in the case of failure of one or even two channels. High performance aircraft that have FBW controls (also called CCVs or Control-Configured Vehicles) may be deliberately designed to have low or even
