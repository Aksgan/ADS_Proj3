specimen for ''[[Cimbrophlebia brooksi]]'', a fossil [[scorpion fly]]. By convention, the red label denotes a [[type specimen]].]] In biology, a '''type''' is one particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an [[organism]] to which the [[scientific name]] of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example which serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular [[taxon]]. A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] which includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a [[species description]]) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution. ==Type specimen== According to an precise set of rules laid down by the [[ICZN]] and the [[ICBN]], the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular ''specimen'', or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a specially designated ''type collection'' in a [[museum]] research collection, or are a particular plant sample in a [[herbarium]]. Usually types are a physical example of the taxon, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon can be used. This material is the "type" or "types" of that taxon. Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]]. When identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type which all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen, and publishes a new name and an official description. This process is crucial to the science of biological [[taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped changes and shifts over time. How do we know that that which we call "''[[Canis lupus]]''" is the same thing - or approximately the same thing - as what they will be calling "''Canis lupus''" in 200 years time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in a museum somewhere, and everyone who uses that name - no matter what else they may mean by it - will mean that particular specimen. Depending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an illustration, a description, or a taxon. For example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird which is commonly known as the [[Spotted Harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary. Note that at least for '''type specimens''' there is no requirement for a "typical" individual to be used. When describing new species, this is often impossible to tell anyway until more research has been done. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more "typical" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term '''[[name-bearing type]]''' or '''onomatophore''' is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define "typical" individuals or (in zoology) [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged. The usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', type-based definitions are replaced by [[phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definitions]]. == Types in botany == In [[botanical nomenclature]], a ''type'' (''typus'', ''nomenclatural type''), "is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached."<ref>Art 7.1 ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]''.</ref> A [[botanical name]], by itself, is only a phrase (of one to three words). For a name to be meaningful it is necessary to be sure what it applies to. A type fixes a botanical name to a [[taxon]]. In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, "curated", in a herbarium (or the equivalent for fungi). Notable cases of where an illustration may serve as a type are (this is not an exclusive listing): * A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy (as we now know it). In those days a dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future: many specimens that famous botanists looked at have since been lost or damaged. However, there were devoted botanical artists who upon assignment by a botanist (or naturalist) could make a faithful and detailed work of botanical art, for inclusion in a costly book. * A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through
