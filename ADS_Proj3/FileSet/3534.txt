and easily sprayed on in new construction and was also useful in masking ceiling defects in older homes, such as stains, uneven ceilings or poor workmanship. It was the standard for bedroom and residential hallways ceilings for its noise reduction qualities{{Citation needed|reason=I can't find any evidence that popcorn ceilings actually have noise reduction qualities. Cite or reword.|date=January 2011}}, while kitchen and living rooms ceilings would normally be textured in smoother skip-trowel or [[Orange peel (effect)|orange peel]] texture for their higher durability and ease of cleaning. Unfortunately, its bright white "[[cottage cheese]]" texture often contained [[asbestos]]. Some popcorn ceiling textures were created using a paper based or [[Styrofoam]] product to create the texture, rather than asbestos. Nevertheless, when [[asbestos]] was banned in ceiling treatments in 1977,<ref>http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/ashome.html#example Asbestos in Your Home at EPA.com</ref> popcorn ceilings fell out of favor. Fashions changed to more natural and handmade finishes. Popcorn ceilings become unattractive when they get dirty, are easily damaged, and are hard to clean, repaint, or repair. They can be easily, if messily, removed by spraying them with water to soften them up, and scraping the material off with a large scraping trowel or putty knife.<ref>http://www.ronhazelton.com/archives/howto/popcorn_ceiling_removal.shtm How to Remove a Popcorn Textured Ceiling</ref> If they may have been applied before the ban on asbestos, their removal should only be done by a licensed professional or after testing to rule out asbestos contamination. ==References== {{reflist}} {{arch-stub}} [[Category:Ceilings]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29623</id> <title>PortAudio</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = PortAudio | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | collapsible = | author = | developer = | released = | latest release version = v19 | latest release date = 7 December 2007 | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]] | operating system = [[Cross-platform]] | platform = | size = | language = | status = | genre = [[Application programming interface|API]] | license = [[MIT License]] | website = [http://www.portaudio.com/ www.portaudio.com] }} '''PortAudio''' is a [[computer library]] for [[sound|audio]] playback and recording. Its primary goal is to be a [[cross-platform]], [[open source]] library, so that programs that use it can run on many different computer [[operating system]]s. Like many other libraries, especially those whose primary goal is portability, PortAudio is written in the [[C programming language]]. PortAudio is part of the [[PortMusic]] project, which aims to provide a set of platform independent libraries for music software. The free [[audio editor]] [[Audacity]] uses the PortAudio library, and so does the [[JACK Audio Connection Kit]] on the Windows platform. PortAudio is based on a callback paradigm, similar to JACK and [[Audio Stream Input/Output|ASIO]]. ==References== * [http://www.developer.com/net/cplus/article.php/3590641/PortAudio-Portable-Audio-Processing-for-All-Platforms.htm PortAudio: Portable Audio Processing for All Platforms] * [http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/113776 Using portable, multi-OS sound systems] ==External links== * [http://www.portaudio.com PortAudio website] [[Category:Computer libraries]] [[Category:Audio libraries]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C]] [[Category:Software using the MIT license]] [[pt:PortAudio]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29624</id> <title>PortMidi</title> <text>'''PortMidi''' is a [[computer library]] for [[Real-time computing|real time]] input and output of [[MIDI]] data.

It allows authors to provide product descriptions and specifications to online sources in a standard way, using a standard data format, a simplified subset of [[XML]], that will allow webmasters and program librarians to automate program listings. PAD saves time for both authors and [[webmaster]]s. Each field in the specification has a [[regular expression]] (regex) associated with it. The regex acts as a constraint on the field: if the regex matches, the field value is legal and if it fails to match, the field and the PAD file as a whole are out of spec. Only files where all fields in the file pass validation are properly called PAD files. The simplifications in PAD over XML are primarily PAD does not use name/value pairs in tags. All tags are attribute-free. This is less expressive than XML but easier to parse. The official PAD spec uses unique tags. To extract the fields in the official spec, it is not necessary to descend through the tag path. However, if multiple languages are represented in a single PAD file, then correct parsing does require descending though the tag path because leaf tags are duplicated for each language supported. == External links == *[http://pad.asp-software.org/ Official PAD site] *[http://pad.asp-software.org/spec/spec.php The Official PAD specification] *[http://pad.asp-software.org/spec/validate.php The Official PAD validator] *[http://pad.asp-software.org/xtensions.php PAD Extensions Directory] *[http://pad.asp-software.org/padlinks.php 30 or so free and commercial PAD products, services, and links] *[http://paddatabase.net/ PAD database and graphics updated weekly] *[http://www.siprofessionals.org/developers/viewarticle.php?id=si20070802 About PAD files (Software Industry Professionals)] *[http://www.sharewarepromotions.com/PAD_Validation.asp PAD Validation Tool] *[http://www.padbuilder.com/ Online PAD Generator] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[Category:Computer file formats]] [[category:XML]] [[de:Portable Application Description]] [[it:Portable Application Description]] [[hu:Hordozható alkalmazásleírás]] [[pt:PAD]] [[ru:Portable Application Description]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29638</id> <title>Portable Computer and Communications Association</title> <text>{{Dablink|This stub refers top a communications association, for other uses of the acronym, PCCA, see [[PCCA (disambiguation)]].}} {{Orphan|date=February 2009}} The '''Portable Computer and Communications Association''' formed in June 1992 as a forum for participants in mobile communication to share information about [[technology|technological]] advancements.
