tape. The Bascoders were broadcast by NOS as well, but could also be bought from NOS on cassette and shared among friends and acquaintances. The format, which was very well-protected against interference, could be read and written by all popular home computer hardware. The robustness of the format also made broadcasting via [[mediumwave]] radio possible, which increased the range and in turn the number of potential users. For example, data broadcast by the Netherlands station TROS ([[Televisie en Radio Omroep Stichting]], also known as [[Radio Hilversum]]) could be received in large parts of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. ===BASICODE 2=== [[Image:Sinclair ZX81.jpg|thumb|right|ZX81]] [[Image:Apple-II.jpg|thumb|right|Apple II]] The standard solved one of the aforementioned problems, the incompatible data formats. However, programs still had to be adapted to each computer's BASIC dialect and hardware capabilities. Limiting the programs to only use instructions common across all dialects meant big limitations in terms of functionality, for example completely refraining from using graphics and sound and only uncomfortable methods to input data using the keyboard and to control character output on the screen. For this reasons, in 1984 the enhanced standard BASICODE 2 was created. Bascoders using this standard did not only contain routines for input and output of data to tape. In addition to a set of about 50 BASIC commands, functions and operators that were common across all BASIC dialects, the language standard of BASCODE 2 defined a library of subroutines that emulated the same capabilities across all supported computers. To achieve this, all program lines below 1000 were reserved for the Bascoder, and BASICODE programs could only start at line number 1000. The subroutines of the Bascoder in the lines below 1000 were called with a [[GOSUB]] command. Necessary arguments were passed to the Bascoder by using special predefined variables that were reserved for use by the Bascoder. The standard contained a number of additional rules that were made necessary by the limitations of some computer models. For example, on the ZX-81 a line of code could only contain a single BASIC command, a behaviour that almost no other computer shared. On a KC series computer, a line of code could not be longer than 60 characters. These limitations had to be enforced for all BASICODE programs to guarantee platform independence, because the Bascoder was interpreted by the same computer specific BASIC interpreter as the BASICODE program itself. Thus, the Bascoders were loaded on the various computers like normal programs and provided the additional routines for the common standard and cassette I/O afterwards. Programs written in BASICODE were only usable after the Bascoder had been loaded and started. However, on some computers the BASICODE programs could be merged with the routines of the Bascoders and saved in the native data format. The resulting program was not platform independent any longer, but due to the higher data density of most native formats it could be loaded much faster than the same program in BASICODE format. Also, because it was not necessary to load the complete Bascoder to run the program, more RAM remained available at run time. There were BASICODE 2 Bascoders for the [[Exidy Sorcerer]], [[Colour Genie]], [[Commodore PET]], [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64|C64]], [[Amiga]], [[Sinclair ZX81]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Sinclair QL|QL]], [[Acorn Atom]], [[BBC Micro|Micro]], [[Acorn Electron|Electron]], Tandy [[TRS-80]], [[MSX]], [[Oric Atmos]], [[P2000T]], [[Grundy NewBrain]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[IBM PC]], [[Apple II]], [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A]], [[Mattel Aquarius]] and others. Additionally, advanced users were able to write their own Bascoder for their system of choice, since the language standard and data format were open and well-documented. The BASICODE 2 standard made the development of platform independent programs with advanced capabilities (for the time) possible. In addition, BASICODE was used to transmit and share information like computer scene news via radio in the form of so-called "journals". A BASICODE coding tutorial and other documentation was transmitted this way as well. ===BASICODE 3 / 3C=== In 1986, the new BASICODE 3 standard was developed. The most important additions were routines for simple [[monochrome]] graphics, reading and writing data from within programs and sound output. BASICODE 3 made BASICODE popular in the computer scene of the GDR, and from 1989 onward BASICODE programs were transmitted via radio throughout the GDR. Also, a book was published which included a vinyl record with Bascoders for all computers common in the GDR. The last revision of BASICODE, which featured color graphics, was released as BASICODE 3C in 1991. ===The end of BASICODE=== From about 1990 onward the popularity of BASICODE declined rapidly due to the rise of 16- and 32-bit computers, especially IBM-PC variants and compatible systems. Even though there were Bascoders for these machines, BASICODE was too limited to make use of the resources that that generation of computers provided. Additionally, because of the much fewer common architectures in the 16- and 32-bit era, the main reason for the development and use of BASICODE became moot. As the hardware and software of the new systems became more and more complex, most users became unable or disinclined to write programs. The rise of [[graphical user interfaces]] contributed to the decline in popularity of 8-bit computers and consequently BASICODE as well. The successor of the GDR's state broadcaster, the [[Deutschlandsender|Deutschlandsender Kultur]] (which later became part of the new [[Deutschlandradio]]), continued to broadcast BASICODE programs until about 1992. A planned standard called BASICODE 4 never became reality, because NOS stopped supporting the project shortly after BASICODE 3C was released. BASICODE is still used by enthusiasts, in particular 8-bit computer fans, for nostalgic value, but is not of any practical relevance. ==Historical significance== BASICODE was an early attempt at creating a standard for the exchange of programs and data across mutually incompatible home computer architectures. It is roughly contemporary to the [[MSX]] standard developed by [[Microsoft]], which specified a shared hardware platform in addition to a common BASIC dialect. These computers were sold by multiple companies and directly competed with other popular home computers. MSX was successful mostly in the home markets of the manufacturers, for example
