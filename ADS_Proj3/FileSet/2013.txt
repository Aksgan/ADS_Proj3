folded Claris back into the parent company, returning HyperCard to Apple's core engineering group. In 1992, Apple released the eagerly anticipated upgrade of HyperCard 2.2 and made many HyperCard enthusiasts happy by including licensed versions of Color Tools and Addmotion II, adding support for color pictures and animations. However, these tools were limited and often cumbersome to use because HyperCard still lacked true, internal color support. ===HyperCard 3.0=== Several attempts were made to restart HyperCard development once it returned to Apple. Because of the product's widespread use as a multimedia-authoring tool it was rolled into the [[QuickTime]] group. A new effort to allow HyperCard to create '''QuickTime interactive''' (QTi) movies started, once again under the direction of Kevin Calhoun. QTi extended QuickTime's core multimedia playback features to provide true interactive facilities and a low-level programming language based on 68000 assembly language. The resulting '''HyperCard 3.0''' was first presented in 1996 when an alpha-quality version was shown to developers at Apple's annual [[Worldwide Developers Conference]].<ref>{{cite journal |first =Clifford | last = Colby |month=September |year=1996 |url=http://folkstream.com/muse/teachhc/hc3.html |title=HyperCard's new deal: QuickTime authoring |journal=MacWeek}}</ref> Under the leadership of [[Dan Crow (computer scientist)|Dan Crow]] development continued through the late 1990s, with public demos showing many popular features such as color support, internet connectivity, and the ability to play HyperCard stacks (which were now special QuickTime movies) in a [[web browser]]. Development of HyperCard 3.0 stalled when the QuickTime team was focused away from development of QuickTime interactive to the streaming features of QuickTime 4.0.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Duncan | first = Geoff | title = Alas, HyperCard! | journal = TidBits | date = Nov 02, 1998 | url = http://db.tidbits.com/article/5155 }} </ref> Finally in 2000 the HyperCard engineering team was reassigned to other tasks after [[Steve Jobs]] decided to abandon the product. Calhoun and Crow both left Apple shortly after in 2001. In the years that followed, the program saw no additional support from Apple. Apple finally ceased selling HyperCard in March 2004.<ref>Tim Oren (March 26, 2004).

Bill Atkinson later lamented that if he had only realized the power of network-oriented stacks, instead of focusing on local stacks on a single machine, HyperCard could have become the first Web browser.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2002/08/54370 HyperCard: What Could Have Been]</ref> HyperCard saw a loss in popularity with the growth of the World Wide Web, since the Web could handle and deliver data in much the same way as HyperCard without being limited to files on one's own hard disk. HyperCard had a significant impact on the web as it inspired the creation of both [[HTTP]] itself (through its influence on [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s colleague [[Robert Cailliau]]),<ref>[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/ic-cailliau Robert Cailliau on the WWW Proposal: "How It Really Happened."]</ref> and [[JavaScript]] (whose creator, [[Brendan Eich]], was inspired by [[HyperTalk]] <ref>{{cite web | first = Brendan | last = Eich | year = 1998 | <!-- Forward to the --> | url = http://www.dannyg.com/pubs/jsb/JSB6TOC.html | title = JavaScript Bible, 3rd Ed. }}</ref>).

Four products are currently available which offer HyperCard-like functionality: * '''[[HyperNext]]''' is a freeware software development system that uses many ideas from HyperCard and can create both standalone applications and stacks that run on the freeware Hypernext Player. '''[[HyperNext]]''' is available for Mac OS X & Mac OS 9, and Windows XP & Vista. * '''[[HyperStudio]]''', one of the first HyperCard clones, is, as of 2009, currently developed and published by [[Software MacKiev]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mackiev.com/hyperstudio/hs_reviews.html|title=HyperStudio|publisher=Software MacKiev|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> * Runtime Revolution's '''[[LiveCode (development environment)|LiveCode]]''' expands greatly on HyperCard's feature set and offers color and a GUI toolkit which can be deployed on many popular platforms (Classic Macintosh system software, Mac OS X, Windows 98 through Vista, and Linux/Unix). LiveCode directly imports existing HyperCard stacks and provides a migration path for stacks still in use. *'''[[SuperCard]]''' is similar to HyperCard, but with many additional features such as: full color support, pixel and vector graphics, a full GUI toolkit, and support for many modern Mac OS X features. It runs only on Macs. * '''[[TileStack]]''' is an attempt to create a web based version of HyperCard that is compatible with the original HyperCard files.<!-- [[WP:DATED]] It is currently in Beta. --><ref>{{cite web | title = HyperCard comes back from the dead to the web | url = http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/08/06/07/196242.shtml }} </ref> Past products included: * '''[[WinPlus|Plus]]''' was a product similar to HyperCard for Windows and Macintosh. * Asymetrix's Windows application '''[[ToolBook]]''' resembled HyperCard, and later included an external converter to read HyperCard stacks (the first was a third-party product from Heizer software). * [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] purchased Plus and created a cross-platform version as '''[[Oracle Card|OracleCard]]''', later renamed '''[[Oracle Media Objects]]''', used as a [[4GL]] for database access. In addition, many of the basic concepts of the original system were later re-used in other forms. Apple built their system-wide scripting engine [[AppleScript]] on a language similar to HyperTalk; it is often used for [[Desktop
