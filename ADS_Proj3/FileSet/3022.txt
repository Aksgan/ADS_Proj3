as "LH" or "10" under the old system have been re-rated as "7". ==India== [[File:Vegamcensorcertificate-1.gif|thumb|Sample Censor certificate issued by Indian Censor Board that appears just before the beginning of a film. "V/U" implies that the film is sanctioned for ''video'' exhibition and given a rating of ''Unrestricted Public Exhibition''.]] In India, [[Central Board of Film Certification]] (CBFC) is responsible for certifying films meant for public exhibition. The Censor Board presently gives four categories of certificates, namely, * '''U''': Unrestricted Public Exhibition throughout India, * '''A''': Public exhibition restricted to adults above 18 years only, * '''U/A''': Unrestricted public exhibition with parental guidance for children below the age of 12 * '''S''': Exhibition to restricted audience such as doctors etc. '''Analysis of Censor Ratings in India''': 1. The Film Rating system of CBFC categorizing films into 'U', 'UA', 'A', 'S' is not only simplistic but also primitive. Except for the letters such as 'A', 'U' etc. there is no audience-friendly system of film ratings in the form of 'icons' of different colors indicating different age groups, unlike many other countries. 2. Before screening of the film, only the original Censor certificate is displayed in which except for the 'certified title' ('A', 'U' etc.) in which nothing else can be read by the audience. (See the sample censor certificate) 3. It is ironic that the vital details of Censor Caution such as 'interpretation of certified title', 'suitable age group', 'name of the film' etc. appear in a very small font that no body can read them on the screen. This practice of showing Censor Certificates (instead of easily recognizable colour icons with age group) dates back to the 1950s and is still continued without any modifications. 4. While the CBFC certifies hundreds of films in Indian regional languages (e.g., Telugu, Tamil, Bengali etc.), the contents of Censor Certificate/Caution are in English and Hindi only. Hence, ordinary viewers and illiterates can't understand anything about CBFC Film ratings. 5. CBFC's website (http://cbfcindia.gov.in/) started working from April 30, 2010, after being non-functional for many years. 6. The Film ratings of CBFC are not prominently indicated in the film publicity material such as posters, handbills etc. and advertisements in print media etc. though the law provides for the same. Nowadays, television and the Internet have become major forms of media through which film publicity reaches millions of audience through advertisements, film-based programmes, Local Film listings, exclusive websites on new films etc., but presently, there is no legal stipulation that film publicity through electronic media should indicate/display CBFC rating. This lacuna questions the very utility and relevance of CBFC and its ratings. 7. Citing above lacunae responsible for disinformation to audience about CBFC Film ratings (and violation of their fundamental right to know about films), 'MediaWatch-India' [http://www.mediawatchindia.org], a voluntary organization filed a writ petition (WP No. 15732/2009) in High Court of Andhra Pradesh, against Ministry of I&B to modify the format of censor caution to make it audience-friendly and in line with international best practices. 8. Consequent to the High Court's order in above writ petition, Ministry of I&B, in December 2009, has decided to modify the censor caution and amend relevant rules accordingly. Also, the draft Cinematograph Bill, 2010 [https://2708441328429095554-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/mediawatchindia123/DraftCinematographBill,2010.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coUdjxuvNvpt3UC0yAcv4bXu61f95OXIqttnqjednLhcCf6rQCGfboida_-Xj11Taq2qqEYYbQafZOJowPMCBqNXGoDvQ1TqXV4K9cqElMrAlj6ATkdYT6Ta8adQI6aDxDs3kap-HcRt9pounZuxCFOT1XQ58GgOLSREzHDiLKwbqnpTNVgzoJ02ZDfazz9yjayGeSw82wZlkUnMxjyeMx5IZjVe5miR-qhwdiRmroUi8XZMSc%3D&attredirects=0] has proposed two more Film Rating Categories 12+, 15+ in place of existing U/A and provided for monetary penalty for not displaying the Censor Certificate before exhibition of the film. (Position by the mid-December 2010). ==Indonesia== Motion pictures shown in Indonesia must undergo reviewing by the Indonesian Film Censor Board [http://www.lsf.go.id (Lembaga Sensor Film)]. Other than issuing certificates, the LSF also reviews and issues permits for film-related advertising, such as movie trailers and posters. LSF has the authority to cut scenes from films. Certificates are issued based on the following categories: *'''SU''' (''Semua Umur''): All ages *'''A''' (''Anak-anak''): Children (3–12 years) *'''BO-A''' (''Bimbingan Orangtua-Anak-anak''): Parental Guidance-Children *'''BO''' (''Bimbingan Orangtua''): Parental Guidance (parental supervision is recommended for persons under 13 years) *'''BO-R''' (''Bimbingan Orangtua-Remaja''): Parental Guidance-Teen *'''R''' (''Remaja''): Teen (13–15 years and over) *'''D''' (''Dewasa''): Adult (17 years and over) ==Ireland== The [[Irish Film Classification Office]] (IFCO) under which theatrical films are placed into one of the following categories: *'''G''' - ''General'' - Suitable for viewing by anyone. *'''PG''' - ''Parental Guidance'' - Parental guidance is recommended for children under the age of 12. *'''12A''' - ''Parental Guidance required for children under 12'' - A person over 18 years of age must accompany a child under the age of 12 when seeing a film theatrically. Prior to 2004 this used to be '''12PG'''. *'''15A''' - ''Parental Guidance required for children under 15'' - A person over 18 years of age must accompany a child under the age of 15 when seeing a film theatrically. Prior to 2004 this used to be '''15PG'''. *'''16''' - Films classified in this category are considered to be suitable for persons of sixteen or over. Children under this age cannot be admitted to screenings. Violent content, crude and sexual content, and depiction of violence may be stronger than in films designated 15A. Introduced in 2004. *'''18''' - ''Adults only'' - The film is suitable only for adults. Nobody under this age can be admitted. ''[[9 Songs]]'' in October 2004 became the first film featuring explicit sex scenes to receive a certificate. Films without certification are not ''[[ipso facto]]'' banned and have been shown at [[film festival]]s and [[art film|arthouse]] clubs such as the [[Irish Film Institute]]. For video releases ([[VHS]] and [[DVD]]), categories '''G''', '''PG''' and '''18''' share the same meanings as above, however, there is no '''16''', and categories '''12''' and '''15''' are mandatory, not advisory. There used to be an additional category, '''12RA''', for video releases. This means that children under 12 can watch the video however an adult of at least 18 years old must accompany him/her. This is an extremely rarely used rating. Due to there not being a "16" classification for home media it the movie is sometimes cut on the video version in order to meet
