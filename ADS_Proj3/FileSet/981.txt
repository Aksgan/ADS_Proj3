of switches. Thus an exchange with a hundred 10x10 switches in five stages could only have twenty conversations in progress. Distributed control meant there was no common point of failure, but also meant that the setup stage lasted for the ten seconds or so the caller took to dial the required number. In control occupancy terms this comparatively long interval degrades the traffic capacity of a switch. [[Image:Crossbar-banjo2-hy.jpg|thumb|"Banjo" wiring of a 100 point six wire Type B Bell System switch]] Starting with the [[1XB switch]], the later and more common method was based on the link principle, and used the switches as crosspoints. Each moving contact was multipled to the other contacts on the same level by simpler "banjo" wires, to a link on one of the inputs of a switch in the next stage. The switch could handle its portion of as many calls as it had levels or verticals. Thus an exchange with forty 10x10 switches in four stages could have a hundred conversations in progress. The link principle was more efficient, but required a more complex control system to find idle links through the [[switching fabric]]. This meant [[common control]], as described above: all the digits were recorded, then passed to the common control equipment - the [[Marker (telecommunications)|marker]] - to establish the call at all the separate switch stages simultaneously. A marker-controlled crossbar system had in the marker a highly vulnerable central control; this was invariably protected by having duplicate markers. The great advantage was that the control occupancy on the switches was of the order of one second or less, representing the operate and release lags of the X-then-Y armatures of the switches. The only downside of common control was the need to provide digit recorders enough to deal with the greatest forecast originating traffic level on the exchange. The Plessey [[TXK]]1 or 5005 design used an intermediate form, in which a clear path was marked through the switching fabric by distributed logic, and then closed through all at once. In some countries, no crossbar exchanges remain in revenue service. However, crossbar exchanges remain in use in countries like [[Russia]], where some massive city telephone networks have not yet been fully upgraded to digital technology. Preserved installations may be seen in [[museum]]s like [http://www.museumofcommunications.org/ The Museum of Communications] in Seattle, Washington, and the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]]. Changing nomenclature can confuse: in current American terminology a "switch" now frequently refers to a system which is also called a "telephone exchange" (the usual term in English)--that is, a large collection of selectors of some sort within a building. For most of the twentieth century a "[[Strowger switch]]" or a "crossbar switch" referred to an individual piece of mechanical equipment making up part of an exchange. Hence the pictures above show a "crossbar switch" using the earlier meaning. ===Semiconductor=== Semiconductor implementations of crossbar switches typically consist of a set of input amplifiers or retimers connected to a series of metalizations or "bars" within a semiconductor device. A similar set of metalizations or "bars" are connected to output amplifiers or retimers. At each cross-point where the "bars" cross, a pass transistor is implemented which connects the bars. When the pass transistor is enabled, the input is connected to the output. As computer technologies have improved, crossbar switches have found uses in systems such as the [[multistage interconnection networks]] that connect the various processing units in a [[Uniform Memory Access]] parallel processor to the array of memory elements. ==Arbitration== A standard problem in using crossbar switches is that of setting the cross-points. In the classic telephony application of cross-bars, the crosspoints are closed and open as the telephone calls come and go. In [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or packet switching applications, the crosspoints must be made and broken at each decision interval. In high-speed switches, the settings of all of the cross-points must be determined and then set millions or billions of times per second. One approach for making these decisions quickly is through the use of a [[wavefront arbiter]]. ==See also== *[[Nonblocking minimal spanning switch]] - describes how to combine crossbar switches into larger switches. == References == {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.telephonetribute.com/switches_survey_chapter_6.html 1XB] *[http://www.telephonetribute.com/switches_survey_chapter_7.html 5XB] *[http://www.telephonetribute.com/switches_survey_chapter_8.html 4XB] *[http://www.telephonetribute.com/switches_survey_chapter_9.html XBT] *[http://www.actw.nl/Openbare%20centrales/ARF.htm Ericsson ARF (in Dutch)] *[http://xy3.com/phone/your%20calls%20and%20mine.shtml Photos of Bell System crossbar switches and equipment] *[http://www.thg.org.uk/special_interest/Crossbar.html ''Crossbar switches'' (with photos & drawings) by Peter Walker] *[http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/1050/crossbarswitcher.png Crossbar switch diagram in paraller processing] {{Telephone Switches}} [[Category:Switches]] [[Category:Telephone exchange equipment]] [[Category:Electronic circuits]] [[de:Koppelfeld]] [[es:Conmutador de barras cruzadas]] [[eo:Koordinata maŝino]] [[it:Sistema pentaconta]] [[ja:クロスバースイッチ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8553</id> <title>Crossdisciplinarity</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} '''Crossdisciplinarity''' describes any method, project and research activity that examines a subject outside the scope of its own [[discipline]] without cooperation or integration from other relevant disciplines. In crossdisciplinarity, topics are studied using foreign methodologies of unrelated disciplines. Crossdisciplinarity is distinctly different from [[Interdisciplinarity]] because of the relationship that the disciplines share. Within a crossdisciplinary relationship disciplinary boundaries are crossed but no techniques or ideals are exchanged while Interdisciplinary relationships blend the practices and assumptions of each discipline involved. [[Multidisciplinarity]] is very closely related to crossdisciplinarity because there is no transfer of methodologies or cooperation between the disciplines but different in that 'more than one' other outside discipline examines a specific topic. ==See also== * [[Over-disciplinary]] * [[Interdisciplinary]] * [[Multidisciplinarity]] * [[Systemics]] * [[Transdisciplinarity]] * [[Science of Team Science]] [[Category:Interdisciplinary fields]] {{Psychology-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8557</id> <title>Crossover effects</title> <text>In [[linguistics]], '''crossover effects''' are restrictions on possible [[Binding (linguistics)|binding]] or [[coreference]] found between certain [[phrase]]s and [[pronoun]]s. Crossover effects are divided into weak crossover or strong crossover. == Weak crossover == In [[syntax]], weak crossover (or WCO) refers to the restriction on possible binding or coreference found between certain phrases and pronouns, as the two below: : (1) ?Who<sub>''i''</sub> does his<sub>''i''</sub> mother love ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>? : (2) ?His<sub>''i''</sub> mother loves [each boy]<sub>''i''</sub>. In (1), the object [[interrogative word|wh]]-phrase ''who'' is said to have 'crossed over' the pronoun 'his' embedded in the subject.
