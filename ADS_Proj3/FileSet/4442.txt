In October 1995, de Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project [[fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD 1.0. The initial [[Software release|release]], OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0.<ref>de Raadt, Theo. Mail to openbsd-announce: ''[http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive2/announce/199610/msg00001.html The OpenBSD 2.0 release],'' October 18, 1996. Visited December 10, 2005.</ref> Since then, the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months, each of which is maintained and supported for one year. == Outspokenness == [[Image:Maddog-deraadt.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[maddog|Jon "maddog" Hall]] presents de Raadt with [[BSD Daemon|daemon]] horns at [[Fórum Internacional Software Livre|fisl8]]]] De Raadt has been a vocal advocate of Free Software since the inception of OpenBSD, but he is also a strong proponent of free speech, having on occasion had rather public disputes with various groups, from Linux advocates to governments. This outspoken attitude, while sometimes the cause of conflict, has also led him to acclaim; de Raadt has given presentations at open source, free software and security conferences around the world &mdash; including [[FOSDEM]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], [[Usenix]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[United States|U.S.]], [[AUUG]] Conference in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and [[fisl]] in [[Porto Alegre]], RS, [[Brazil]]. === DARPA funding cancellation === After de Raadt stated his disapproval of the U.S.-led [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|occupation of Iraq]] in an April, 2003 [[interview]]<ref>Globe and Mail article: [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article996772.ece "U.S. military helps fund Calgary hacker"]. April 6, 2003. Accessed October 30, 2006.</ref> with [[Toronto]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'', a multi-million-dollar [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] grant to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[POSSE project]] was cancelled, effectively ending the project. Funding from the grant had been used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBSD, as well as many other projects and was to be used to pay for the ''[[hackathon]]'' planned for May 8, 2003. Despite money from the grant already having been used to secure accommodations for sixty developers for a week, the money was reclaimed by the government at a loss and the hotel was told not to allow the developers to pay the reclaimed money to resecure the rooms.<ref>LWN.net article: [http://lwn.net/Articles/29186/ "DARPA Cancels OpenBSD Funding"]. April 24, 2003. Accessed April 5, 2006.</ref> This resulted in criticism among some that the US military held an anti-[[free speech]] attitude. The grant termination was, however, not as bad a blow as some portrayed it. The project's supporters rallied to help and the hackathon went on almost as planned. The funding was cut mere months before the end of the grant, further fueling the speculations regarding the situation surrounding the grant's termination. It did, however, also negatively influence DARPA funding on other BSD-related projects, such as FreeBSD. === Free driver advocacy === De Raadt is also well known for his advocacy of [[free software]] [[device driver|drivers]]. He has long been critical of developers of [[Linux]] and other free platforms for their tolerance of non-free drivers and acceptance of [[non-disclosure agreement]]s. In particular, de Raadt has worked to convince [[IEEE 802.11|wireless]] hardware vendors to allow the [[firmware]] images of their products to be freely redistributed. These efforts have been largely successful, particularly in negotiations with [[Taiwan]]ese companies, leading to many new wireless drivers. Today, de Raadt encourages wireless users to "buy Taiwanese", due to lack of willingness from US companies like [[Intel]] and [[Broadcom]] to release firmware images free from [[software license|licensing]] restrictions. For this de Raadt was awarded the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s [[2004]] [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]]. === Clash with Linux developers === In April 2007, de Raadt was involved in a controversy involving the use of [[GPL]] code from the Linux ''bcm43xx'' driver in the BSD ''bcw'' driver.<ref>LXer article: [http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/85224/ Broadcom Driver Dispute Uglier Than Necessary]. April 7, 2007. Accessed April 8, 2007.</ref><ref>Thread on gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general: [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/1558/focus=1558 OpenBSD bcw: Possible GPL license violation issues] Various dates beginning April 4, 2007. Accessed April 8, 2007.</ref> Linux developers accused the BSD community of infringing GPL code, but de Raadt denied infringement, arguing that the BSD driver was not "released". He also maintained that the conflict was not about GPL, but the way Linux developer [[Michael Buesch]] handled the situation. To Buesch's email, he responded:<ref>Thread on gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general: [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/1561 Re: OpenBSD bcw: Possible GPL license violation issues]. April 4, 2007. Accessed April 15, 2007.</ref> {{quote| It will be resolved in our tree, but it is up to him which way he does it. But when you approach issues like this with comments like "We'd like you to start contacting us to resolve the issue now" and your first mail is cc'd to a couple hundred people.... in the future, please think more carefully, ok? Because right now, in that mail, you've pretty much done Broadcom's job for them. You've told the entire BSD community who may want to use a driver for this chip later, that because of a few GPL issues you are willing to use very strong words -- published very widely -- to disrupt the efforts of one guy who is trying to do things for them. And, you are going to do this using the GPL, even. You did not privately mail that developer. No, you basically went public with it. That is how about half the user and developer community will see it. They will see your widely posted mail as an overly strong position.}} Another clash occurred in August 2007, when a group of Linux developers attempted to modify the license of dual-licensed ath5k driver. De Raadt summarized the issue as follows:<ref>[http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20070901041657] Accessed August 21, 2008.</ref> {{quote| GPL fans said the great problem we would face is that companies would take our BSD code, modify it, and not give back. Nope -- the great problem we face is that people would wrap the GPL around our code, and lock us out in the same way that these supposed companies would lock us out. Just like the Linux community, we have many companies giving us code back, all the time. But once the code is GPL'd, we cannot get it back.}} ==References==
