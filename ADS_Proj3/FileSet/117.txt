required, the program may specify its advanced load, even before the confirmation that the item will be needed. In the [[Itanium]] architecture, this advanced load order may be issued by an ''ld.a'' instruction. This instruction allocates an entry in the '''Advanced Load Address Table''' and starts the data transfer. The '''ALAT''' is used to identify the address from where the data will be read, the length of the required data block, the destination register and the state of the load operation. The success of the advanced load may then be checked with a ''ld.c'' or ''chk.a'' instruction that looks for the related information in the '''ALAT'''. The '''ALAT''' in the original ''Itanium'' processor was implemented by a 2-way [[set-associative]] memory with 32 entries. In the ''Itanium 2'', this unit was changed to a 32 entries [[fully associative]] structure. This design required extra hardware elements (longer memory tags, and more tag [[digital comparator|comparators]]) but it improved performance of speculative programs since [[cache miss]] due to mapping conflicts is avoided. ==References== {{Unreferenced|technology article|date=May 2007}} ==External links== *[http://www.intel.com/design/itanium/manuals/iiasdmanual.htm Intel Itanium Architecture] [[Category:Intel microprocessors]] [[Category:Central processing unit]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1124</id> <title>Advanced RISC Computing</title> <text><!-- Missing image [[Image:Arc_axp_screen.jpg|thumb|right|An ARC console screen on an Alpha AXP system]] --> : ''not to be confused with [[Advanced RISC Machines]]'' '''Advanced RISC Computing''' ('''ARC''') is a specification promulgated by a defunct consortium of [[computer]] manufacturers (the [[Advanced Computing Environment]] project), setting forth a standard [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] [[RISC]]-based computer [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[firmware]] environment. Although ACE went defunct, and no computer was ever manufactured which fully complied with the ARC standard, the ARC system still exerts a widespread legacy in that all [[Microsoft]] [[Windows NT]]-based [[operating systems]] (such as [[Windows XP]]) used ARC conventions for naming [[Booting|boot]] devices before [[Windows Vista]]. Further, [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] uses a modified version of the ARC firmware (which it calls [[ARCS (computing)|ARCS]]) in its systems. All SGI computers which run [[IRIX]] 6.1 or later (such as the [[SGI Indy|Indy]], [[SGI Octane|Octane]], ''etc.'') boot from an ARCS console (which uses the same drive naming conventions as Windows, accordingly). In addition, most of the various RISC-based computers designed to run Windows NT used versions of the ARC boot console to boot NT. Among these computers were: * MIPS R4000-based systems such as the [[MIPS Magnum]] workstation * all [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]]-based machines with a [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus designed prior to the end of support for Windows NT Alpha in September 1999 (the Alpha ARC firmware was also known as AlphaBIOS) * most Windows NT-capable [[PowerPC]] computers (such as the IBM [[RS/6000]] 40P). It was also predicted that [[Intel]] [[IA-32]]-based computers would adopt the ARC console, although only SGI ever marketed such IA-32-based machines with ARC firmware (namely, the [[SGI Visual Workstation]] series, which went on sale in 1999).

During the course of the drawing the other users are updated live on the course of the map's development. The software allows saving and loading the sketches to and from the files, stored on the local [[Hard disk drive|HDD]]. The aim behind the creation of the software kit is to give the players an easy and efficient way to share and visualise tactical data. ==Supported Applications== The applications which can, to this date, be enhanced with ATC (listed by series)<ref>[http://www.foolishentertainment.com/index.asp?p=2&s=1 Foolish Entertainment, ATC's supported applicatios]</ref>: * [[Battlefield 1942]] * [[Battlefield 2]] * [[Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow]] * [[Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory]] * [[Ghost Recon 2]] * [[Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter]] * [[Rainbow Six: Lockdown]] * [[Battlefield: Bad Company 2]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.foolishentertainment.com/index.asp?p=0 Foolish Entertainment Official Website] [[Category:Computer programming tools]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1131</id> <title>Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|date=December 2009}} [[Image:ATLAS Enclosure.png|right|thumb|ATLAS enclosure for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] attractions]] The '''Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator''', or '''ATLAS''', is a large [[hydraulic]] [[motion simulator]].
