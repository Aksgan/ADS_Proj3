an infinite number of possible angles between θ and 90 degrees, and each one will determine two lines through ''P'' and disjointly parallel to ''l'', there exist an infinite number of ultraparallel lines. Thus we have this modified form of the parallel postulate: In hyperbolic geometry, given any line ''l'', and point ''P'' not on ''l'', there are exactly two lines through ''P'' which are asymptotic to ''l'', and infinitely many lines through ''P'' ultraparallel to ''l''. The differences between these types of lines can also be looked at in the following way: the distance between asymptotic lines shrinks toward zero in one direction and grows without bound in the other; the distance between ultraparallel lines (eventually) increases in both directions. The [[ultraparallel theorem]] states that there is a ''unique'' line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each of a given pair of ultraparallel lines. In Euclidean geometry, the "angle of parallelism" is a constant; that is, any distance <math>\lVert BP \rVert</math> between parallel lines yields an angle of parallelism equal to 90°. In hyperbolic geometry, the [[angle of parallelism]] varies with the <math>\Pi(p)</math> function. This function, described by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]], produces a unique angle of parallelism for each distance <math>p = \lVert BP \rVert</math>. As the distance gets shorter, <math>\Pi(p)</math> approaches 90°, whereas with increasing distance <math>\Pi(p)</math> approaches 0°. Thus, as distances get smaller, the hyperbolic plane behaves more and more like Euclidean geometry. Indeed, on small scales compared to <math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}</math>, where <math>K\!</math> is the (constant) [[Gaussian curvature]] of the plane, an observer would have a hard time determining whether he is in the Euclidean or the hyperbolic plane. == Triangles == Distances in the hyperbolic plane can be measured in terms of a unit of length <math>R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}</math> , analogous to the radius of the sphere in [[spherical geometry]]. Using this unit of length a theorem in hyperbolic geometry can be stated which is analogous to the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. If <math> a, b\,</math> are the legs and <math>c\,</math> is the hypotenuse of a right triangle all measured in this unit then: :: <math>\cosh c=\cosh a\cosh b\,.</math> The '''cosh''' function is a [[hyperbolic function]] which is an analog of the standard cosine function. All six of the standard [[trigonometric functions]] have hyperbolic analogs. In trigonometric relations involving the sides and angles of a hyperbolic triangle the hyperbolic functions are applied to the sides and the standard trigonometric functions are applied to the angles. For example the law of sines for hyperbolic triangles is: :<math>\frac{\sin A}{\sinh a} = \frac{\sin B}{\sinh b} = \frac{\sin C}{\sinh c}.</math> For more of these trigonometric relationships see [[hyperbolic triangle]]s. Unlike Euclidean triangles whose angles always add up to 180 degrees or <math>\pi</math> [[radian]]s the sum of the angles of a hyperbolic triangle is always strictly less than 180 degrees. The difference is sometimes referred to as the [[Defect (geometry)|defect]]. The area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by its defect multiplied by <math>R^2</math> where <math>R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}</math> . As a consequence all hyperbolic triangles have an area which is less than <math>\pi{R^2}</math>. The area of an ideal hyperbolic triangle is equal to this maximum. As in [[spherical geometry]] the only similar triangles are congruent triangles. == Circles, Spheres, and Balls == In hyperbolic geometry the circumference of a circle of radius <math>r \,</math> is greater than <math>2 \pi r \,.</math> It is in fact equal to :<math>2\pi R \sinh \frac{r}{R} \,.</math> The area of the enclosed disk is :<math>2\pi R^2 (\cosh \frac{r}{R} - 1) \,.</math> The surface area of a sphere is :<math>4\pi R^2 \sinh^2 \frac{r}{R} \,.</math> The volume of the enclosed ball is :<math>\pi R^3 \sinh \frac{2r}{R} - 2\pi R^2r \,.</math> For the measure of an [[n-sphere|''n''&minus;1 sphere]] in ''n'' dimensional space the corresponding expression is :<math>\Omega_{n} R^{n-1} \sinh^{n-1} \frac{r}{R} \,</math> where the full ''n'' dimensional [[solid angle]] is :<math> \Omega_{n}=\frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma \left (\frac{n}{2} \right )} \,</math> using <math>\Gamma \,</math> for the [[Gamma function]]. The measure of the enclosed ''n'' ball is: :<math>\Omega_{n} R^{n-1} \int_0^r \sinh^{n-1} \frac{r}{R}dr \,.</math> == History == A number of geometers made attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] by assuming its negation and trying to derive a contradiction, including [[Proclus]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), [[Omar Khayyám]],<ref>See for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.resonancepub.com/omarkhayyam.htm|title=Omar Khayyam 1048-1131|accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref> [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Witelo]], [[Gersonides]], [[Alfonso]], and later [[Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri]], [[John Wallis]], [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]].<ref> http://www.math.columbia.edu/~pinkham/teaching/seminars/NonEuclidean.html</ref> Their attempts failed, but their efforts gave birth to hyperbolic geometry. The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam and al-Tusi on [[quadrilateral]]s, including the [[Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral]] and [[Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral]], were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had a considerable influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Gersonides, Alfonso, John Wallis and Saccheri.<ref>Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), "Geometry", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, p. 447-494 [470], [[Routledge]], London and New York: {{quote|"Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam and al-Tusi, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the nineteenth century. In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines - made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the thirteenth century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') - was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the fourteenth century by the Jewish scholar [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gerson]], who lived in southern France,
