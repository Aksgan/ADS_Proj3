Large Data Bases (VLDB) |date = 2010 |title=Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets}}</ref>, a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for analysis of read-only nested data. To use the data in BigQuery, it first must be uploaded to [[Google Storage]] and in a second step imported using the BigQuery HTTP API. BigQuery requires all requests to be authenticated, supporting a number of Google-proprietary mechanisms as well as [[OAuth]]. == Features == * '''Managing data''' - create and delete tables based on a JSON-encoded schema, import data from [[Google Storage]]. * ''' Query''' - the queries are expressed in a SQL dialect and the results are returned in [[JSON]] with a maximum reply length of approximately 4MB (currently, there is no support for paging through results that exceed this limit). BigQuery does not currently support joins. * '''Integration''' - BigQuery can be used from [http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/ Google Apps Script] and [[Google Docs|Google Spreadsheets]]. * '''Access Control''' - is done via [[Google Storage]]. == Notes == {{Reflist}} == References == {{refbegin}} * {{cite web | title = Google BigQuery - Getting Started | url = http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/docs/getting-started.html#queries | date = 2010 }} * {{cite web | title = Google BigQuery - Creating, Populating, and Deleting Tables | url = http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/docs/uploading.html | date = 2010 }} * {{cite web | title = Google BigQuery - Libraries and Scripts | url = http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/docs/libraries.html | date = 2010 }} * {{cite web | title = Google BigQuery - Using BigQuery from a Google Spreadsheet | url = http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/docs/spreadsheet_appscript_tutorial.html | date = 2010 }} {{refend}} == External links == *[http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/ Official website] *[https://groups.google.com/group/bigquery-discuss/ BigQuery discuss Discussion Group] *[http://www.slideshare.net/cschalk/introduction-to-new-google-cloud-platform-technologies-google-storage-goo Intro to new Google cloud technologies: Google Storage, Prediction API, BigQuery] slideshare presentation by Chris Schalk (Developer Advocate at Google) *[http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/01/bigquery-meet-google-spreadsheets.html BigQuery, meet Google Spreadsheets] *[http://bigdatacraft.com/opendremel OpenDremel: Google BigQuery / Dremel implementation] *[http://bqs-endpoint.appspot.com/ BigQuery Endpoint] (an unofficial) [[Google App Engine]] application for issuing queries {{Cloud computing}} {{Google Inc.}} [[Category:Web services]] [[pl:BigQuery]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3754</id> <title>Big data</title> <text>[[Image:Viegas-UserActivityonWikipedia.gif|thumb|right|A data visualization [http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/projects/chromogram.html created by IBM] shows that '''Big data''' such as Wikipedia edits by bot Pearle are more meaningful when enhanced with colors and position.<ref>Watters, Audrey.

Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media. http://radar.oreilly.com/r2/release2-0-11.html</ref> == Definition == Big Data is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time. Big data sizes are a constantly moving target currently ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data in a single data set. == Examples == Examples include web logs, RFID, sensor networks, social networks, Internet text and documents, Internet search indexing, call detail records, genomics, astronomy, biological research, military surveillance, medical records, photography archives, video archives, and large scale eCommerce. == Technologies == Big Data requires exceptional technologies to efficiently process large quantities of data within tolerable elapsed times. Technologies being applied to Big Data include massively parallel processing (MPP) databases, datamining infrastructures such as the Apache [[Hadoop]] Framework, distributed file systems, distributed databases, [[MapReduce]] algorithms, cloud computing platforms, the Internet, and archival storage systems. Some but not all MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, backup, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS. <ref>Monash, Curt ''eBay’s two enormous data warehouses'', April 30, 2009 http://www.dbms2.com/2009/04/30/ebays-two-enormous-data-warehouses/</ref> <ref>Monash, Curt ''eBay followup — Greenplum out, Teradata > 10 petabytes, Hadoop has some value, and more'', October 6, 2010 http://www.dbms2.com/2010/10/06/ebay-followup-greenplum-out-teradata-10-petabytes-hadoop-has-some-value-and-more/</ref> ==See also== {{Commons category|Database}} {{Commons category|Database models}} {{Div col|cols=2}} * [[BigTable]] * [[Cloud computing]] * [[Cloud infrastructure]] * [[Database theory]] * [[Database-centric architecture]] * [[Datastructure]] * [[Hadoop]] * [[MapReduce]] * [[Online database]] * [[Real time database]] * [[Relational database]] {{Div col end}} ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== * [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBFPTvch7y4 YouTube video] featuring Roger Magoulas of O'Reilly on "Big Data: Technologies & Techniques for Large-Scale Data."
