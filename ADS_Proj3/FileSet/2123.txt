reflected in the various spatial senses of the English word ''out''. ''Out'' may be used in cases where a clearly defined trajector (TR) leaves a spatially bounded landmark (LM), as in: :(1a) John went out of the room. :(1b) Mary got out of the car. :(1c) Spot jumped out of the pen. In the most prototypical of such cases the landmark is a clearly defined container. However, ''out'' may also be used to indicate those cases where the trajector is a mass that spreads out, effectively expanding the area of the containing landmark: :(2a) She poured out the beans. :(2b) Roll out the carpet. :(2c) Send out the troops. Finally, ''out'' is also often used to describe motion along a linear path where the containing landmark is implied and not defined at all: :(3) The train started out for Chicago. Experientially basic and primarily spatial image schemas such as the Containment schema and its derivatives the Out schemas lend their logic to non-spatial situations. For example, one may metaphorically use the term ''out'' to describe non-spatial experiences: :(4) Leave out that big log when you stack the firewood. (Schema used directly and non-metaphorically.) :(4a) I don't want to leave any relevant data out of my argument. (Schema metaphorically projected onto argumentation.) :(4b) Tell me your story again, and don't leave out any details. (Schema metaphorically projected onto story-telling.) :(4c) She finally came out of her depression. (Schema metaphorically projected onto emotional life.) Johnson argues that more abstract reasoning is shaped by such underlying spatial patterns. For example, he notes that the logic of containment is not just a matter of being in or out of the container. For example, if someone is in a ''deep'' depression, we know it is likely to be a long time before they are well. The deeper the trajector is in the container, the longer it will take for the trajector to get out of it. Similarly, Johnson argues that transitivity and the law of the excluded middle in logic are underlaid by preconceptual embodied experiences of the Containment schema. ==Lakoff: Image schemas in Brugman's ''The story of Over''== In case study two of his book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things'', Lakoff re-presented the analysis done of the English word ''over'' done by Claudia Brugman in her doctoral dissertation. Similar to the analysis of ''out'' given by Johnson, Lakoff argued that there were six basic spatial schemas for the English word ''over''. Moreover, Lakoff gave a detailed accounting of how these schemas were interrelated in terms of what he called a ''radial category structure''. For example, these six schemas could be both further specified by other spatial schemas such as whether the trajector was in contact with the landmark or not (as in ''the plane flew over the mountain'' vs. ''he climbed over the mountain''). Furthermore Lakoff identified a group of "transformational" image schemata such as rotational schemas and path to object mass, as in ''Spider-Man climbed all over the wall''. This analysis raised profound questions about how image schemas could be grouped, transformed, and how sequences of image schemas could be chained together in language, mind and brain. ==Relationships to similar theories== Johnson indicates that his analysis of ''out'' drew upon a doctoral dissertation by [[Susan Lindner]] in linguistics at Berkeley, and more generally by the theory of cognitive grammar put forth by [[Ronald Langacker]] (Langacker 1987). For the force group of image schemas Johnson also drew on an early version of the [[Force Dynamics|force dynamic]] schemas put forth by Len Talmy, as used by linguists such as Eve Sweetser. Other influences include Wertheimer's gestalt structure theory and [[Schema (Kant)|Kant's account of schemas]] in categorization, as well as studies in experimental psychology on the [[mental rotation]] of images. In addition to the dissertation on ''over'' by Brugman, Lakoff's use of image schema theory also drew extensively on Talmy and Langacker's theories of spatial relations terms as well. ==Lists of image schemas== While Johnson provided an initial list of image schemas in ''The Body in the Mind'' (p. 126), his diagrams for them are scattered throughout his book and he only diagrammed a portion of those image schemas he listed. In his work, Lakoff also used several additional schemas.
