This round-trip time is usually reported as the player's 'ping'. It is used as an effective measurement of the player's [[latency (engineering)|latency]], with lower ping times being desirable. Note that this style of ping typically does not use ICMP packets. ==See also== * [[List of DOS commands]] * [[List of Unix utilities]] * [[Traceroute]] * [[Ping of death]] * [[Smurf attack]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * {{man|8|ping||send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts}} {{Unix commands}} {{Windows commands}} [[Category:Network analyzers]] [[Category:Open source network management software]] [[Category:Network-related software]] [[Category:Unix network-related software]] [[Category:Windows communication and services]] [[Category:Windows administration]] [[ar:بينج (أمر)]] [[ca:Ping]] [[cs:Ping]] [[da:Ping]] [[de:Ping (Datenübertragung)]] [[et:Ping (programm)]] [[el:Ping]] [[es:Ping]] [[eu:Ping]] [[fa:پینگ]] [[fr:Ping (logiciel)]] [[gl:Ping]] [[ko:핑]] [[id:Ping]] [[it:Ping]] [[he:פינג]] [[ka:Ping (იუნიქსი)]] [[lv:Ping]] [[lt:Ping]] [[hu:Ping]] [[mk:Ping]] [[ml:പിങ്]] [[nl:Ping (netwerk)]] [[ja:Ping]] [[pl:Ping]] [[pt:Ping]] [[ro:Ping]] [[ru:Ping]] [[sk:Ping]] [[fi:Ping]] [[sv:Ping]] [[th:ปิง (คอมพิวเตอร์)]] [[tr:Ping]] [[uk:Ping]] [[vi:Ping]] [[zh:Ping]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29285</id> <title>Pinnacle Systems</title> <text>{{Infobox Company | name = '''Pinnacle Systems, Inc.''' | logo = | type = [[Privately held company|Private]] | genre = | foundation = 1986 | founder = Ajay Chopra, Randall Moore, Mirek Jiricka | location_city = Mountain View | location_country = USA | location = [[California]] | locations = | area_served = | key_people = | industry = | products = | services = | revenue = | operating_income = | net_income = | assets = | equity = | owner = | num_employees = | parent = [[Avid Technology]] | divisions = | subsid = | slogan = | homepage = http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Home/ | footnotes = | intl = }} '''Pinnacle Systems, Inc.''' is a [[California]]-based [[United States|American]] manufacturer of [[digital video]] hardware and software for the consumer and broadcast markets. The company was founded in 1986 by Ajay Chopra, Mirek Jiricka and Randall Moore. The company completed its IPO (NASDAQ: PCLE) in November 1994. In 1997 Pinnacle purchased Miro Computer Systems GmbH and in 2001 the video editing business of FAST MultiMedia AG. In 2002 Pinnacle purchased [[VOB Computersysteme]] GmbH. In 2003 Pinnacle purchased [[Steinberg]], only to sell it off to [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] in 2004. Pinnacle was subsequently acquired by American company [[Avid Technology]] in August 2005. ==Products== Pinnacle products include: *[[Pinnacle Studio]] *[[Dazzle (Video Recorder)|Dazzle]] *VideoSpin (Windows) *Groovy Music City *Mobile Media Converter *Instant DVD Recorder *Video Capture for Mac *Avid Liquid On-air graphics products now under Avid brand: *Deko character generators *MediaStream servers *Lightning still stores *Thunder video servers Divested products: [[Image:Miro PCTV Pro.jpg|thumb|PCTVpro]] *PCTV (now owned by Hauppauge Digital) *TV for Mac (now owned by Hauppauge Digital) Discontinued products: *[[SoundBridge]] *[[Pinnacle Profiler|Profiler]] *[[Pinnacle TVCenter PRO|TVCenter PRO]] *Video Transfer *PDS Video Switcher *ShowCenter *DC30plus *Pro-ONE *DC1000 *DC2000 *DV500 ==See also== *[[Video remix]] ==External links== *[http://www.pinnaclesys.com Pinnacle Systems] [[Category:Companies established in 1986]] [[Category:Electronics companies of the United States]] [[Category:Film and video technology]] [[Category:Graphics hardware companies]] [[Category:Software companies of the United States]] [[de:Pinnacle Systems]] [[es:Pinnacle Systems]] [[fr:Pinnacle Systems]] [[it:Pinnacle Systems]] [[nl:Pinnacle]] [[pt:Pinnacle Systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29294</id> <title>Pipe bursting</title> <text>[[Image:Pipebursting.png|thumb|420px|Pipe replacement by pipe bursting]] '''Pipe bursting''' is a [[trenchless]] method of replacing buried [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] (such as sewer, water, or natural gas pipes) without the need for a traditional [[construction trench]]. "Launching and receiving pits" replace the trench needed by conventional pipe-laying. ==Methodology== An expanding device called an expander head, which may be either [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]], is introduced into the defective pipeline through a launching pit. As it travels through the pipeline toward the receiving pit it breaks the pipe into many small pieces, pushing the pieces into the surrounding soil. New pipe is attached to the back of the expander head, replacing the line immediately.<ref>{{cite paper | title=Guidelines for Pipe Bursting | url=http://www.ttc.latech.edu/publications/guidelines_pb_im_pr/bursting.pdf| date=2001| author=Simicevic, Jadranka and Sterling, Raymond L.| publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Research and Development Center }}</ref> ==Equipment== There are five key pieces of equipment used in a pipebursting operation: the expander head, pulling rods, a pulling machine, a retaining device, and a hydraulic power pack. Today's expander heads have a leading end much smaller in diameter than the trailing (bursting) end, small enough to fit through the pipe that will be replaced. The smaller leading end is designed to guide the expander head through the existing pipe; earlier models did not have this feature and lost course at times, resulting in incomplete pipe bursts and project failures. The transition from the leading end to the trailing end can include "fins" that make first contact with the existing pipe. Using these fins as the primary breaking point is a very effective way to ensure that the pipe is broken along the entire circumference. A machine is set in the receiving pit to pull the expander head and new pipe into the line. The head is pulled by heavy, interlocking links that form a chain. Each link weighs several hundred pounds. All of the equipment used in a pipebursting operation is powered by one or multiple hydraulic power generators. ==Other applications== Pipebursting may also be used to expand pipeline carrying capacity by replacing smaller pipes with larger ones, or "upsizing." Extensive proving work by the gas and water industries has demonstrated the feasibility of upsizing gas mains, [[water main]]s and [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s. Upsizing from 100mm to 225mm diameter is now well established, and pipes of up to 900mm <ref>{{cite paper | title=Pipe Bursting Repair of the City of Tallahassee: Capital Circle 36-Inch Hobas Force Main| url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?268408| date=2010| author=B.
