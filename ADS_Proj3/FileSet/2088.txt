publish one integrated data-model for all live cycle aspects. But due to the complexity, different groups of developers and different speed in the development processes, the splitting into several APs was needed. But this splitting made it difficult to ensure that APs are interoperable in overlapping areas. Main areas of harmonization are: * AP 214, 203 and 242 in the area of 3D mechanical design. AP 214 took over all of the functionality of the earlier AP 203 edition and then extending the capabilities significantly. The second edition of AP 203 (to be published in 2010/2011) took over bigger parts of AP 214 by adding again new functionality. The upcoming AP242 will formally replace AP 203, 214 and other mechanical design APs * AP 201, 202, 212, 214, 221 and now AP 203 ed 2 for technical drawings with extension in AP 212 and 221 for schematic functionality * AP 214, 224 and 238 for machining features. * AP 203ed2, 210, 214, 224, [[STEP-NC|238]] for [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] For complex areas it is clear that more than one APs are needed to cover all major aspects: * AP 212 and 214 for electro-mechanical products such as a car or a transformer * AP 203/214, 209 and 210 for electro/electronic-mechanical products * AP 212, 215, 216, 218, 227 for ships * AP 203/214, 224, 240 and [[STEP-NC|238]] for the complete design and manufacturing process of piece parts. ==See also== * [[Boundary representation]] * [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.tc184-sc4.org Standardization group ISO TC184/SC4] ** [http://www.tc184-sc4.org/titles/STEP_Titles.htm List of STEP parts] ** [http://www.nsrp.org/t23/ STEP Ship team ISO TC 184/SC 4/WG 3/T 23] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/stepmod The STEP Module Repository on SourceForge] * [http://www.cax-if.org CAx Implementor Forum] - information on existing implementations and testing activities * [http://www.tc184-sc4.org/SC4_Open/SC4_Standards_Developers_Info/Files/STEP_application_handbook_63006.pdf STEP APPLICATION HANDBOOK ISO 10303 VERSION 3] * [http://www.wikistep.org WikiSTEP] - tutorial and overview information about STEP and recommended practices * [http://pdesinc.aticorp.org PDES, Inc.] - recommended practices and links * [http://www.kstep.or.kr Korea STEP Center] * [http://www.plcs-resources.org Product Life Cycle Support (PLCS) Resources] * [http://www.isg-scra.org/STEP/ AP 224 implementation] * [http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ad-ad.nsf/en/ad03581e.html#navigation Introducing STEP] * [http://www.pdm-if.org/pdm_schema/pdmug_release4.2_010906.doc PDM schema] - a common subset extracted from AP 203 and AP 214 * [http://www.pdesinc.com/downloadable_files/oagis-step%20report.pdf STEP-OAGIS Harmonization] {{Vector graphics markup languages|state=uncollapsed}} {{ISO standards}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Iso 10303}} [[Category:ISO standards|#10303]] [[Category:CAD file formats]] [[de:Standard for the exchange of product model data]] [[es:ISO 10303]] [[fa:ایزو ۱۰۳۰۳]] [[fr:Standard pour l'échange de données de produit]] [[it:ISO 10303]] [[ja:ISO 10303]] [[pt:STEP]] [[ru:STEP (стандарт)]] [[fi:ISO 10303]] [[yo:ISO 10303]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17712</id> <title>ISO 13567</title> <text>'''ISO 13567''' is an international [[Computer-aided design|Computer-aided design (CAD)]] layer standard. ==Standard parts== The standard is divided in three parts: * ISO 13567-1:1998 **Technical product documentation — Organization and naming of layers for CAD — Part 1: Overview and principles *ISO 13567-2:1998 **Technical product documentation — Organization and naming of layers for CAD — Part 2: Concepts, format and codes used in construction documentation *ISO/TR 13567-3:1999 **Technical product documentation — Organization and naming of layers for CAD — Part 3: Application of ISO 13567-1 and ISO 13567-2 Standard has been developed by Technical Committee TC 10 (Technical product documentation) Subcommittee SC 8 (Construction documentation); Refer.
