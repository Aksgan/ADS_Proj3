in Pittsburgh and graduated in 1977 with a Masters in Computer Science. Currently, he is married to Marsha Guggenheim and father to two children, Abra Castle and Joshua Guggenheim. After his time at CMU, Ralph worked for the [[New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab]]. He was soon contacted by Lucasfilm and moved to California in 1980. During his time at Lucasfilm, Guggenheim developed EditDroid, which proved to be a revolutionary film-editing system. After his research lab at Lucasfilm was sold to [[Steve Jobs]] and renamed Pixar, Guggenheim continued to work in the world of graphics and animation. Guggenheim, a respected founder of Pixar, eventually became Vice President of Feature Animation and was a lead producer for ''[[Toy Story]].''<ref>Price, David A., "The Pixar Touch", Knopf, 2008, ISBN 0307265757</ref> Guggenheim left the company in 1997. Since his time at Pixar, Guggenheim has worked as an executive at Electronic Arts. After his time at Electronic Arts, Guggenheim started, with three other partners, Alligator Planet, which is an animation studio that emphasizes production and leadership. Guggenheim is currently the CEO of Alligator Planet. == References == {{reflist}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Guggenheim, Ralph | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 1951 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Guggenheim, Ralph}} [[Category:Computer graphics professionals]] [[Category:American film producers]] [[Category:Lucasfilm]] [[Category:Electronic Arts]] [[Category:1951 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni]] [[es:Ralph Guggenheim]] [[fr:Ralph Guggenheim]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31195</id> <title>Ramanujan summation</title> <text>{{Expert-subject|Mathematics|date=November 2008}} '''Ramanujan summation''' is a technique invented by the mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] for assigning a sum to infinite [[divergent series]]. Although the Ramanujan summation of a divergent series is not a sum in the traditional sense, it has properties which make it mathematically useful in the study of divergent [[infinite series]], for which conventional summation is undefined. Ramanujan summation essentially is a property of the partial sums, rather than a property of the entire sum, as it doesn't exist. If we take the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula|Euler–Maclaurin summation formula]] together with the correction rule using [[Bernoulli number]]s, we see that: :<math>\begin{align} \frac{f\left( 0\right) }{2}+f\left( 1\right) +\cdots+f\left( n-1\right) + \frac{f\left( n\right) }{2} &=\frac{f\left( 0\right) +f\left( n\right) }{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}f\left(k\right)\\ &= \int_0^n f(x)\,dx + \sum_{k=1}^p\frac{B_{k+1}}{(k+1)!}\left(f^{(k)}(n)-f^{(k)}(0)\right)+R_p. \end{align}</math> Ramanujan<ref> Bruce C. Berndt, [http://www.comms.scitech.susx.ac.uk/fft/math/RamanujanNotebooks1.pdf Ramanujan's Notebooks], ''Ramanujan's Theory of Divergent Series'', Chapter 6, Springer-Verlag (ed.), (1939), pp. 133-149.</ref> wrote it for the case ''p'' going to infinity: :<math> \sum_{k=1}^{x}f(k)=C+\int_0^x f(t)\,dt+\frac{1}{2}f(x)+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!}f^{(2k-1)}(x),</math> where ''C'' is a constant specific to the series and its analytic continuation and the limits on the integral were not specified by Ramanujan, but presumably they were as given above. Comparing both formulae and assuming that ''R'' tends to 0 as ''x'' tends to infinity, we see that, in a general case, for functions ''f''(''x'') with no divergence at ''x'' = 0: :<math>C(a)=\int_0^a f(t)\,dt-\frac{1}{2}f(0)-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!}f^{(2k-1)}(0),</math> where Ramanujan assumed <math>a=0</math>. By taking <math>a=\infty</math> we normally recover the usual summation for convergent series. For functions ''f''(''x'') with no divergence at ''x'' = 1, we obtain: :<math>C(a)=\int_1^a f(t)\,dt+\frac{1}{2}f(1)-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!}f^{(2k-1)}(1).</math> ''C''(0) was then proposed to use as the sum of the divergent sequence. It is like a bridge between summation and integration. Using standard extensions for known divergent series, he calculated "Ramanujan summation" of those. In particular, the sum of {{nowrap|[[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + · · ·]]}} is :<math>1+2+3+\cdots = -\frac{1}{12}\ (\Re)</math> where the notation <math>(\Re)</math> indicates Ramanujan summation. This formula originally appeared in one of Ramanujan's notebooks, without any notation to indicate that it was a Ramanujan summation. For even powers we have: :<math>1+2^{2k}+3^{2k}+\cdots = 0\ (\Re)</math> and for odd powers we have a relation with the [[Bernoulli number]]s: :<math>1+2^{2k-1}+3^{2k-1}+\cdots = -\frac{B_{2k}}{2k}\ (\Re).</math> Those values are consistent with the [[Riemann zeta function]]. More recently, the use of ''C''(1) has been proposed as Ramanujan's summation, since then it can be assured that one series <math> \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f(n) </math> admits one and only one Ramanujan's summation, defined as the value in 1 of the only solution of the difference equation <math> R(x)-R(x+1)=f(x) </math> that verifies the condition <math> \int_1^2 R(t)\,dt=0 </math>.<ref> Éric Delabaere, [http://algo.inria.fr/seminars/sem01-02/delabaere2.pdf Ramanujan's Summation], ''Algorithms Seminar 2001–2002'', F. Chyzak (ed.), INRIA, (2003), pp. 83–88.</ref> This new definition of Ramanujan's summation (denoted as <math>\sum_{n \ge 1}^{\Re} f(n)</math>) does not coincide with the earlier defined Ramanujan's summation (''C''(0)) nor with the summation of convergent series, but it has interesting properties, such as: If ''R''(''x'') tends to a finite limit when ''x'' → +1, then the series <math>\sum_{n \ge 1}^{\Re} f(n)</math> is convergent, and we have :<math>\sum_{n \ge 1}^{\Re} f(n)=\sum_{n \ge 1}^{\infty}f(n)-\lim_{n \to \infty}\int_1^n f(t)\,dt.</math> Another interesting result is this: :<math>\sum_{n \ge 1}^{\Re} \frac{1}{n}=\gamma,</math> where <math> \gamma </math> is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]. Ramanujan resummation can be extended to integrals for example using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula one can write :<math> I(n, \Lambda) = \frac{n}{2}I(n-1, \Lambda) + \zeta(-n) - \sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{2r}}{(2r)!} a_{n,r}(n-2r+1) I(n-2r, \Lambda)</math>, <math> a_{n,r}= \frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma (n-2r+2)} </math> here <math> I(n, \Lambda ) = \int_{0}^{\Lambda}dxx^{n} </math> with <math> \Lambda \rightarrow \infty </math> the application of this Ramanujan resummation lends to finite results in the renormalization of Quantum Field theories == See also == * [[Borel summation]] * [[Cesàro summation]] * [[Ramanujan's sum]] * [[Divergent series]] == References == <references/> [[Category:Mathematical analysis]] [[Category:Mathematical series]] [[Category:Summability methods]] [[Category:Srinivasa Ramanujan]] [[es:Sumatorio de Ramanujan]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31196</id> <title>Rambus</title> <text>{{Dablink|This article is about the company.
