transfer from one to the other, provides extra flexibility. An additional benefit of using DNG is that there can be interchange between a CinemaDNG workflow and a still camera workflow.<ref name="CinemaDNGspecification"/> One use is to extract stills from a movie for publicity or other purposes. The DNG images that Adobe provided in the short example of how to store a video clip as a sequence of DNG files,<ref name="CinemaDNGdownloads">Adobe Labs Downloads: [http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/cinemadng.html CinemaDNG]</ref> (see "Tangible deliverables"), were taken with a [[Canon EOS 30D|Canon EOS 30D dSLR]] camera, (and converted to DNG), rather than with a more conventional movie camera. This shows how any boundaries between different types of photography are weak, and illustrates why such open formats are important for the workflows of the future. ==Timeline== * 7 March 2008: The [[domain name]] cinemadng.org was registered by Adobe. * 14 April 2008: Adobe issued the press release that announced CinemaDNG.<ref name="adobe.com"/><ref>Macworld: [http://www.macworld.com/article/132962/2008/04/cinemadng.html Adobe plans CinemaDNG format for cinema files]</ref><ref>electronista: [http://www.electronista.com/articles/08/04/14/adobe.debuts.cinemadng/ Adobe plans CinemaDNG standard for cinema files]</ref><ref>IT Broadcast and Digital Camera: [http://fullres.blogspot.com/2008/10/raw-quality-key.html Raw Quality Key]</ref> * April 2009 onwards: various companies began to announce plans or even products to support CinemaDNG (see "Signs of progress"). * 10 September 2009: Adobe Labs made available pre-release versions of specifications and products for handling CinemaDNG (see "Tangible deliverables").<ref>Adobe Labs: [http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/cinemadng/ CinemaDNG]</ref><ref>ZDNet: [http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39748339,00.htm Adobe offers CinemaDNG format for raw video]</ref> * 20 November 2009: Adobe Labs provided a "CinemaDNG Refresh" - primarily extra (longer) samples. ==Signs of progress== These are evidence that CinemaDNG is more than [[vaporware]]: * [http://www.iridas.com/ IRIDAS] (April 2009): (IRIDAS Supports CinemaDNG RAW Standard): "IRIDAS ... today announced universal support for the emerging CinemaDNG standard in all of the 2009 versions of its products."<ref>IRIDAS press release: [http://www.iridasmagazine.com/2009/04/07/cinemadng/ IRIDAS Supports CinemaDNG RAW Standard]</ref> * [http://www.siliconimaging.com/ Silicon Imaging] (April 2009): (Silicon Imaging Oscar Filmmaking Digital Cinema Cameras go 3D): "The files can also be exported as a CinemaDNG sequences ... at a later time."<ref>Silicon Imaging press release: [http://www.siliconimaging.com/DigitalCinema/News/PR_04_20_09_3D.html Silicon Imaging Oscar Filmmaking Digital Cinema Cameras go 3D]</ref> * [http://www.visionresearch.com/ Vision Research] (May 2009): (in a forum): "Is a cinemaDNG support planned for the next Software release?" - "Phantom software already has support for save/convert a cine to DNG format.

However, they have repeatedly emphasized that it will be an open format, and Adobe has stated "There are no known intellectual property encumbrances or license requirements for CinemaDNG or its underlying formats DNG, TIFF, XMP, or MXF".<ref>Adobe Labs: [http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/cinemadng/ CinemaDNG] (last bullet point)</ref> It is reasonable to ''speculate'' that eventually CinemaDNG will become a formal standard, based on the history of DNG itself which has been submitted to ISO for use in the revision of ISO 12234-2 ([[Tag Image File Format / Electronic Photography|TIFF/EP]]). Rather than creating entirely new file formats, the strategy for CinemaDNG is primarily to specify how to package files and other data-sets, of existing open and/or standard formats, in consistent ways, so that not only can individual components of a movie be interchanged and archived, but so can sets of clips with all their associated video, audio, and metadata files.<ref name="CinemaDNGspecification"/> The emphasis is on having a systematic structure that supports the very complicated workflows, involving many stages and suppliers and software and hardware components, of movie development.<ref name="CinemaDNGworkflow"/> The CinemaDNG specification is largely about this systematic directory structure and the requirements and constraints that ensure that individual files fit within it. ''If'' CinemaDNG follows the same sort of path to standardization as DNG, (or indeed, PDF), there will first be a period while the specification is tested "in the marketplace" to ensure that it works in practise as well as theory. It will then be revised accordingly, so that whatever is
