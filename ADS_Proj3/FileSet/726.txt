Locally distributed predicates (LDP) === LDP is a [[reactive programming]] language. It has been used to trigger debugging in the earlier research. With the addition of language that enables the programmer to build operations in the development of the shape of the matrix, it can be used to analyze the distributed local conditions.<ref>De Rosa (2008)</ref> It can operate on fixed-size, connected groups of modules providing various functions of state configuration. A program that addresses a fixed-size module rather than the entire ensemble allows programmers to operate the claytronic matrix more frequently and efficiently. LDP further provides a means of matching distributed patterns. It enables the programmer to address a larger set of variables with [[Boolean logic]], which enables the program to search for larger patterns of activity and behavior among groups of modules.<ref>De Rosa (2009)</ref> === Distributed watchpoints === Performance errors for thousands to millions of individual catoms are hard to detect and debug, therefore, claytronics matrix operations require a dynamic and self-directed process for identifying and debugging errors. Claytronics researchers have developed Distributed Watchpoints, an algorithm-level approach to detecting and fixing errors missed by more conventional debugging techniques.<ref>Rister (2007)</ref> It establishes nodes that receive surveillance to determine the validity of distributed conditions.<ref>De Rosa (2007)</ref> This approach provides a simple and highly descriptive set of rules to evaluate distributed conditions and proves effective in the detection of errors. === Algorithms === Two important classes of claytronics [[algorithm]]s are shape sculpting and localization algorithms. The ultimate goal of claytronics research is creating dynamic motion in three dimensional poses. All the research on catom motion, collective actuation and hierarchical motion planning require shape sculpting algorithms to convert catoms into the necessary structure, which will give structural strength and fluid movement to the dynamic ensemble. Meanwhile, localization algorithms enable catoms to localize their positions in an ensemble.<ref>Funiak (2008)</ref> A localization algorithm should provide accurate relational knowledge of catoms to the whole matrix based on [[noise (electronics)|noisy]] observation in a fully distributed manner. == Future applications == As the capabilities of computing continue to develop and robotic modules shrink, claytronics will become useful in many applications. The featured application of claytronics is a new mode of communication. Claytronics will offer a more realistic sense to communication over long distance called pario. Similar to how audio and video provide aural and visual stimulation, pario provides an aural, visual and physical sensation. A user will be able to hear, see and touch the one communicating with them in a realistic manner. Pario could be used effectively in many professional disciplines from engineering design, education and healthcare to entertainment and leisure activities such as video games.<ref>Goldstein (2009), p. 29-45</ref> The advancements in nanotechnology and computing necessary for claytonics to become a reality are feasible, but the challenges to overcome are daunting and will require great innovation. In an interview, December 2008, Jason Campbell, a lead researcher from Intel Labs Pittsburgh said, "my estimates of how long it is going to take have gone from 50 years down to just a couple more years. That has changed over the four years Iâ€™ve been working on the project".<ref>Byrne (2008)</ref> == Notes == {{Reflist|2}} == References == {{Refbegin}} *Aksak, B., Cassell, A., Li, J., Meyyappan, M., & Callen, P.
