raw data from their MIS departments, then they could solve their own information problems. Many users were content to answer seemingly simple aggregate reporting questions that baffled the MIS departments of the day &ndash; like "rank departments by profitability." Other end-users went beyond basic reporting to build large, mission-critical applications, either by learning the necessary skills, or by hiring their own technicians who didn't report through the MIS hierarchy. NCSS developed a large support infrastructure, including training, consulting, and other services, to foster end-user independence. (Dissatisfaction with traditional MIS methods and resources would later also fuel the [[personal computer]] revolution, which in turn would displace [[time-sharing]] vendors like NCSS.) ''[More citations are needed to illustrate: MIS departments of the 70s and 80s; the "Information Center" concept and end-user empowerment in the 80s; the timesharing industry and its role in enabling what became known as "Agile Companies" capable of using information as a competitive advantage. These topics were widely discussed in books and media of the day.]'' In the late 70s, NCSS developed a 'mini-370' product called the NCSS 3200, primarily intended as an in-house platform for running Nomad under the NCSS operating system [[VP/CSS]] (see below). The small, low-cost system was sold as an end-user 'database machine' or 'information warehouse' for extracting and analyzing corporate datasets &ndash; analogous to the dedicated mainframes installed at some of NCSS's larger customer sites. (The [[data warehouse]]/"Information Center" concept was eventually developed more successfully by Focus and others.) Despite limited success, the company lost interest in the 3200 venture, which was scrapped along with the VP/CSS operating system. Nomad was made available under VM in 1982 and under MVS in 1983. Versions were released under [[PC-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in the late 1980s. ==Ownership== [[Dun & Bradstreet]] acquired National CSS in 1979 and rebranded it as [[D&B Computing Services]] or DBCS. In 1986 the NOMAD related assets of DBCS were sold to [[Must Software International]] of [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] (a wholly -owned subsidiary of [[Thomson-CSF]]) which became part of [[Thomson Software Products]] in 1995 and part of [[Aonix]] in 1996. {{As of|2005}} Nomad is sold and maintained by [http://www.selectbs.com/mainframe/Nomad/nomad Select Business Solutions] in [[Trumbull, Connecticut]]. Select is now owned by the private equity firm Avantce LLC. ==NCSS's VP/CSS platform== Until 1982, Nomad was available only on NCSS's proprietary time-sharing system [[VP/CSS]]. During this period, with a few exceptions, Nomad was used only by interactive [[time-sharing]] customers via pay-as-you-go dial-up access. Nomad's primary status as a [[time-sharing]] product &ndash; rather than a licensed software product &ndash; had a major impact on its design, enhancement, sales, training, support, and ultimately its fate. Nomad customers were inextricably linked to [[National CSS]]'s service offerings, and to the unique capabilities of [[VP/CSS]] and the NCSS network. ==User base== When Nomad was released as a licensed software product it was acquired by some of the large corporations that had been using the time-sharing service. These included [[Exxon]] and [[Nytel]]. (A few large users like [[Bank of America]] and [[SOCAL]], i.e. Standard Oil of California, had previously negotiated site licenses for their own [[VP/CSS]] datacenters, most of which ran Nomad. Most [[VP/CSS]] sites eventually migrated to the VM platform.) [[Abbott Laboratories]], [[American Express]]. [[Boeing]], [[First Chicago]], and [[Motorola]] were also customers. Other later customers who were new to the product included [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] and [[Royal & SunAlliance|Royal Insurance]]. With a limited client base came an opportunity for niche suppliers to provide independent application development and support. In the UK this market was filled by [[BSL International]], RCMS, and [[Rex Software]]. RCMS became the UK vendors of Nomad while BSL operated throughout Europe and the US. ==References== {{refbegin}} *[[Daniel McCracken|McCracken, Daniel]], ''A Guide to NOMAD for applications development.''

Inputs and outputs are classified as either ''low'' (low sensitivity, not highly classified) or ''high'' (sensitive, not to be viewed by uncleared individuals). A computer has the non-interference property if and only if any sequence of low inputs will produce the same low outputs, regardless of what the high level inputs are. That is, if a low (uncleared) user is working on the machine, it will respond in exactly the same manner (on the low outputs) whether or not a high (cleared) user is working with sensitive data. The low user will not be able to acquire any [[information]] about the activities (if any) of the high user. ==Formal expression== Let <math>M</math> be a memory configuration, and let <math>M_L</math> and <math>M_R</math> be the projection of the memory <math>M</math> to the low and high parts, respectively.
