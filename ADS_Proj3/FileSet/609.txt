Users may create their own custom reports in addition to the predefined reports. CaseComplete also exports [[XML]] and [[XMI]] files. ==See also== *[[List of UML tools]] *[[Requirements analysis]] *[[Requirements management]] ==External links== *[http://www.casecomplete.com/ CaseComplete home page] [[Category:UML tools]] [[Category:Technical communication tools]] [[Category:Windows software]] {{windows-software-stub}} {{uml-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5578</id> <title>Case Notes (radio show)</title> <text>'''Case Notes''' is a weekly half-hour radio programme on topics in medicine.

Modifying a computer case in any non-standard way is considered a case mod. Many people, particularly [[Computer hardware|hardware]] enthusiasts, use case mods to illustrate a computer's power (by showing off the internal hardware), and also for [[aesthetic]] purposes. Cases may also be modified to improve a computer's performance. ==History== When personal computers first became available to the public, the majority were produced in simple, beige-colored cases. This design is sometimes referred to as a ''[[beige box]]''. Although this served the purpose of containing the components of the [[personal computer]], many users saw their computers as "tacky" or "dull", and some began modifying their existing chassis, or building their own from scratch.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A new market for third-party computer cases and accessories began to develop, and today cases are available in a wide variety of colors and styles. Today the business of "modding" computers and their cases is a hugely profitable endeavor, and modding competitions are not uncommon.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc | title = Science Fiction Case Mod Contest: The First Winner! | url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1823675,00.asp | accessdate = 2009-05-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = Shogun Interactive Development | title = Overclock.net Case Mod Competition 2009 | url = http://www.overclock.net/overclock-net-related-news-information/421591-overclock-net-case-mod-competition-2009-a.html | accessdate = 2009-05-06 }}</ref> ==Common modifications== [[Image:PC case mod lights.jpg|left|thumbnail|A computer modded with lights]] *'''Window mods''': This refers to a window placed within one of the panels of a computer case.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = CrazyPC LLC | title = Windows Kits | url = http://www.crazypc.com/products/casemods/windows.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-07 }}</ref> This is most often done to the left hand side panel, and less often to the top panel.

The lights are sometimes paired with sound controllers that make the lights pulse in time to sound. CCLs come in long tubes and generally produce a little bit of heat. LEDs come in many sizes and forms, most often seen in bars similar to CCLs or within fans, called LED fans. Electroluminescent wire, which takes the form of a small light rope, is often embedded in cables such as [[Serial ATA|SATA]] cables. Lighting modifications are often paired with window mods to help show off the components. Although not as common, they are also placed in cases without a window, allowing light to shine through any holes or gaps of the
