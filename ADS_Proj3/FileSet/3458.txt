[[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and the [[Moab Cluster Suite|Moab]] resource management system. Under the project management of John Lee, the team at Synnex, Voltaire, Supermicro and other suppliers, the scientists were able to dramatically reduce the amount of time it took to go from starting the cluster build to actually having hardware here at Livermore in production. In particular, it went from having 4 SUs on the floor on a Thursday, to bring 2 more SUs in for that final cluster and by Saturday, had all of them wired up, burned in, and running Linpack. == References == <references /> {{super-compu-stub}} [[Category:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] [[Category:Supercomputers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28755</id> <title>PenTile matrix family</title> <text>'''PenTile matrix family''' refers to a family of patented [[subpixel]] matrix schemes used in [[Electronic visual display|electronic device displays]]. PenTile is a trademark of Samsung. These [[pixel geometries|subpixel layouts]] are specifically designed to operate with a proprietary set of subpixel rendering algorithms embedded in the display driver, allowing plug'n'play compatibility with conventional RGB Stripe panels. ==History== [[File:Subpixel rendering RG-B-GR alternated geometry.png|73px|thumb|right|Prototypic five subpixel repeat cell geometry of PenTile Matrix (zoomed at 12:1).]] The brand name, "PenTile Matrix" (a [[neologism]] from [[Wiktionary:penta-|penta-]], meaning "five" and [[Wiktionary:tile|tile]]) was coined by inventor / entrepreneur Candice H. Brown Elliott in 1995 to describe the geometric layout of the prototypical subpixel arrangement that she developed in the early 1990s while conducting independent research on [[subpixel rendering]]. The layout consists of a [[quincunx]] comprising two red subpixels, two green subpixels, and one central blue subpixel in each [[unit cell]]. It was inspired by [[biomimicry]] of the human [[retina]] which has nearly equal numbers of L and M type [[cone cells]], but significantly fewer S cones. As the S cones are primarily responsible for perceiving blue colors, which do not appreciably affect the perception of luminance, reducing the number of blue subpixels with respect to the red and green subpixels in a display does not reduce the image quality. This layout is specifically designed to work with and be dependent upon [[subpixel rendering]] that uses only one and a quarter subpixel per pixel, on average, to render an image. That is, that any given input pixel is mapped to either a red centered logical pixel, or a green centered logical pixel. Ms. Brown Elliott co-founded Clairvoyante, Inc. in 2000 to commercialize the PenTile Matrix family of layouts, raising money from venture capital funds and corporate partners including [[Intel]] Corporation. From 2000 until 2008, Clairvoyante co-developed prototypes of various PenTile displays with a number of Asian LCD manufacturers. In March 2008, Clairvoyante was purchased by [[Samsung]]. Simultaneously, Samsung funded a new company, Nouvoyance, Inc. to continue development of the technology under the leadership of Ms. Brown Elliott.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/news-031908.html|title=Press Release: Samsung Electronics Acquires Clairvoyanteâ€™s IP Assets|accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref> ==PenTile RGBW== PenTile RGBW technology adds a white subpixel to the traditional red, blue, and green subpixels in a color display allowing a brighter display using less power.<ref>{{cite web|title=PenTile RGBW Technology, What does it do?|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology-what.html|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The PenTile RGBW layout uses each red, green, blue and white subpixel to present high-resolution luminance information to the human eyes' red-sensing and green-sensing [[cone cell]]s, while using the combined effect of all the color subpixels to present lower-resolution chroma (color) information to all three cone cell types. Combined, this optimizes the match of display technology to the biological mechanisms of human vision.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology.html|title=PenTile RGBW Technology|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The layout uses one third fewer subpixels for the same resolution as the RGB Stripe (RGB-RGB) layout, in spite of having four color primaries instead of the conventional three, using subpixel rendering combined with [[metamerism (color)|metamer]] rendering. Metamer rendering optimizes the energy distribution between the white subpixel and the combined red, green, and blue subpixels: W <> RGB, to improve image sharpness. The display driver chip has an RGB to RGBW color vector space converter and [[gamut mapping]] algorithm, followed by metamer and [[subpixel rendering]] algorithms. In order to maintain saturated color quality, to avoid simultaneous contrast error between saturated colors and peak white brightness, while simultaneously reducing backlight power requirements, the display backlight brightness is under control of the PenTile driver engine. When the image is mostly desaturated colors, those near white or grey, the backlight brightness is significantly reduced, often to less than 50% peak, while the Liquid Crystal Display levels are increased to compensate. When the image has very bright saturated colors, the backlight brightness is maintained at higher levels. Since most natural images and black on white text have few simultaneously bright and saturated colors, the average power of the PenTile RGBW panel is 50% less than a conventional RGB LCD. Since the [[LCD backlight]] is the major power using component on many portable devices such as cell phones and personal media players, products that use the PenTile RGBW panel have appreciably longer battery life. The PenTile RGBW also has an optional high brightness mode that doubles the brightness of the desaturated color image areas, such as black&white text, for improved outdoor view-ability.

The [[human eye]] is most sensitive to green, especially for high resolution luminance information. Thus the RG-BG scheme creates a color display with one third fewer subpixels than a traditional RGB-RGB scheme but with the same perceived [[display resolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samsungsmd.com/eng/text/AMOLED/ET-1-1-2.jsp|title=Visual(=Pentile) Technology|author=Samsung Mobile Display|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref><ref name="PenTile OLED Resolution Measurement">{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/files/pdf/CV%20Application%20Note%20Measuring%20Display%20Resolution%20RGB%20L6%2012-17-07.pdf|accessdate=August 20, 2010|title=Measuring Display Resolution with Contrast Modulation Methodology|publisher=Nouvoyance}}</ref> This is similar to the [[Bayer filter]] commonly used in digital cameras.
