edge (''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>) is labeled 1 and (''v''<sub>2</sub>, ''v''<sub>3</sub>) labeled 2. The induced labelings on ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, and ''v''<sub>3</sub> are then 1, 0, and 2 respectively. This is an edge-graceful labeling and so ''P''<sub>3</sub> is edge-graceful. Similarly, one can check that ''P''<sub>4</sub> is not edge-graceful. In general, ''P''<sub>m</sub> is edge-graceful when ''m'' is odd and not edge-graceful when it is even. This follows from a necessary condition for edge-gracefulness (see below). === Cycles === Consider the [[cycle graph|cycle]] with three vertices, ''C''<sub>3</sub>. This is simply a triangle. One can label the edges 0, 1, and 2, and check directly that, along with the induced labeling on the vertices, this gives an edge-graceful labeling. Similar to paths, <math>C_m</math> is edge-graceful when ''m'' is odd and not when ''m'' is even. An edge-graceful labeling of <math>C_5</math> is shown in the following figure: [[Image:Edge graceful c5.svg]] == A necessary condition == Lo gave a necessary condition for a graph to be edge-graceful. It is that a graph with ''q'' edges and ''p'' vertices is edge graceful only if :<math>\; q(q+1)</math> is [[Congruence relation#modular arithmetic|congruent]] to <math>\frac{p(p-1)}{2}</math> modulo ''p''. or, in symbols, :<math>q(q+1) \equiv \frac{p(p-1)}{2} \mod p.</math> This is referred to as '''Lo's condition''' in the literature. This follows from the fact that the sum of the labels of the vertices is twice the sum of the edges, modulo ''p''. This is useful for disproving a graph is edge-graceful. For instance, one can apply this directly to the path and cycle examples given above. == Further selected results == *The [[Peterson graph]] is not edge-graceful. *The [[star graph]] <math>S_m</math> (a central node and ''m'' legs of length 1) is edge-graceful when ''m'' is [[even number|even]] and not when ''m'' is [[odd number|odd]]. *The [[friendship graph]] <math>F_m</math> is edge-graceful when ''m'' is odd and not when it is even. *[[Regular tree]]s, <math>T_{m,n}</math> (depth ''n'' with each node emitting ''m'' new vertices) are edge-graceful when ''m'' is even for any value ''n'' but not edge-graceful whenever ''m'' is odd. *The [[complete graph]] on ''n'' vertices, <math>K_n</math>, is edge-graceful unless ''n'' is [[singly even]], <math>n=2\mod 4</math>. *The [[ladder graph]] is never edge-graceful. == References == <references/> #S.

EMAS was developed because none of the manufacturers' operating systems (nor independent systems such as [[Multics]]) came close to satisfying the demanding performance requirements of Edinburgh University. Originally running on the [[ICL System 4/75]] mainframe (based on the design of the [[IBM 360]]) it was later reimplemented <ref>http://www.gtoal.com/athome/edinburgh/docs/Experiment/again.html</ref> on the [[ICL 2900|ICL 2900 series of mainframes]] (as '''EMAS 2900''' or '''EMAS-2''') where it ran in service until the mid 1980s. Near the end of its life, the refactored version was back-ported (as '''EMAS-3''') to the [[IBM XA]] architecture again, running on [[Amdahl]] 470 and NAS VL80 IBM mainframe clones into the early 1990s. It was a powerful and efficient general purpose [[multi-user]] system which supplied all the computing needs of Edinburgh University and the [[University of Kent]] (the only other site outside Edinburgh to adopt the operating system). The final EMAS system (the Edinburgh VL80) was decommissioned in July 1992. EMAS had several advanced (for the time) features, including [[dynamic linking]], multi-level storage, an efficient [[scheduling (computing)|scheduler]], a separate user-space [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] ('director'), a user-level [[shell (computing)|shell]] ('basic command interpreter'), and a [[memory-mapped file]] architecture. Such features lead EMAS supporters to claim that their system was superior to [[Unix]] for the first 20 years of the latter's existence. The Edinburgh Computer History Project is attempting to salvage some of the lessons learned <ref>http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/os/emas/docs/taste/</ref> from the EMAS project and has the complete source code of EMAS online for public browsing.<ref>http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/os/emas/</ref> EMAS was written entirely in the [[Edinburgh IMP]] [[programming language]], with only a small number of critical functions using embedded assembler within IMP sources. ==See also== *[[Atlas Autocode]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Time-sharing operating systems]] [[Category:1970s software]] [[Category:University of Edinburgh]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11702</id> <title>Editorial calendar</title> <text>An '''editorial calendar''' is used by bloggers, publishers, businesses, and groups to control publication of content across different media, for example, [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], [[blog]], email
