powerful [[mnemonic]] device, facilitating memorization. The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example [[William Shakespeare]] often used a rhyming [[couplet]] to mark off the end of a scene in a [[Play (theatre)|play]].

Ribbon diagrams are generated by interpolating a smooth curve through the [[polypeptide]] backbone. [[Alpha_helix|α-helices]] are shown as coiled ribbons or thick tubes, [[Beta_strand|β-strands]] as arrows, and lines or thin tubes for random coils. The direction of the [[Peptide|polypeptide chain]] may be indicated by a colour ramp along the length of the ribbon.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.danforthcenter.org/smith/molview/over/overview.html |first=Thomas J. |last=Smith |title=Displaying and Analyzing Atomic Structures on the Macintosh |date=October 27, 2005 }}</ref> Ribbon diagrams are simple, yet powerful, in expressing the visual basics of a molecular structure (twist, fold and unfold).
