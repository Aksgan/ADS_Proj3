fractals are easily found in nature. These objects display self-similar structure over an extended, but finite, scale range. Examples include clouds, [[snow|snow flakes]], [[crystal]]s, [[mountain|mountain range]]s, [[lightning]], [[river|river networks]], [[cauliflower]] or [[broccoli]], and systems of [[blood vessel]]s and [[pulmonary vessels]]. [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|Coastlines]] may be loosely considered fractal in nature. Trees and ferns are fractal in nature and can be modeled on a computer by using a recursive [[algorithm]]. This recursive nature is obvious in these examples—a branch from a tree or a [[frond]] from a fern is a miniature replica of the whole: not identical, but similar in nature. The connection between fractals and leaves is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees.<ref>"Hunting the Hidden Dimension." ''Nova''. PBS. WPMB-Maryland. 28 October 2008.</ref> In 1999, certain self similar fractal shapes were shown to have a property of "frequency invariance"—the same electromagnetic properties no matter what the frequency—from [[Maxwell's equations]] (see [[fractal antenna]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hohlfeld R, Cohen N |title=Self-similarity and the geometric requirements for frequency independence in Antennae |journal=Fractals |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=79–84 |year=1999 |doi=10.1142/S0218348X99000098}}</ref> <gallery> File:Animated fractal mountain.gif|A fractal that models the surface of a mountain (animation) File:Barnsley fern plotted with VisSim.PNG|[[Barnsley's fern]] computed using an [[Iterated function system]] File:Romanesco Brassica oleracea Richard Bartz.jpg|Photograph of a [[romanesco broccoli]], showing a naturally occurring fractal File:PentagramFractal.PNG|Fractal [[pentagram]] drawn with a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] [[iteration]] program </gallery> ==In creative works== {{See|Fractal art}} Fractal patterns have been found in the paintings of American artist [[Jackson Pollock]]. While Pollock's paintings appear to be composed of chaotic dripping and splattering, computer analysis has found fractal patterns in his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/PHYSICS_!/FRACTAL_EXPRESSIONISM/fractal_taylor.html |title=Richard Taylor, Adam P.

Cyberneticist [[Ron Eglash]] has suggested that fractal-like structures are prevalent in [[African art]] and architecture. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/eglash.dir/afractal/afractal.htm |title=Ron Eglash.
