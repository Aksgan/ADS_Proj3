in the UK by level, mode of study, domicile, gender, class of first degree and subject area 2005/06], ''[[Higher Education Statistics Agency]]''</ref> ===Lower second-class Honours=== This is the second division of second class degrees and is abbreviated as 2:2 (pronounced ''two-two''). ===Third-class Honours=== Third-class honours is the lowest honours classification in most modern universities. Until the 1970s, Oxford awarded Fourth-class honours degrees, but did not distinguish between "Upper-Seconds" (2:1s) and "Lower-Seconds" (2:2s), and so still had four classes like other establishments. Roughly 7.2% of students graduating in 2006 with an honours degree received a Third.<ref name=hesa/><ref name="dutton">[[David Dutton]], ''[[Alec Douglas-Home|Douglas-Home]]'' (Haus Publishing Limited, 2006), page 4 ISBN 9-781904-950677</ref> ===Ordinary Degree=== An Ordinary degree is a pass degree without honours. A number of universities offer ordinary degree courses to students, but most students enrol in honours degree courses. Some honours courses permit students who fail the first year by a small margin (around 10%) to transfer to the Ordinary degree. Ordinary degrees are sometimes awarded to honours degree students who do not complete an honours degree course to the very end but complete enough of it to earn a pass. Scottish universities offer Ordinary degrees as a qualification in its own right, which last three years, as well as an honours degree over four years. This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degree with three years of study, though a similar programme in Scotland is not unheard of, provided a high entrance grade is achieved. An Ordinary degree from a Scottish university (also known as a designated degree) is often sufficient to study a post graduate course. An Ordinary degree in Scotland is not therefore, as in England, a failed honours degree. Students can decide, usually at the end of their second or third year, whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year. Scottish universities may also award their Ordinary degrees with 'distinction' if a student achieves a particularly good grade average, usually 65% or above. A common example of a Scottish Ordinary degree is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] course taken by graduates of other subjects, as this is sufficient (without honours) for entry to the legal profession. ===Uncommon Degree Classifications=== ====Double first==== A "double first" at both Oxford and Cambridge originally referred to first-class honours in two separate subjects in the same set of examinations, usually the [[Classical Tripos|Classical]] and [[Mathematical Tripos|Mathematics]] [[Tripos]]es in Cambridge, or the [[Literae Humaniores]] and [[Mathematics]] [[Final Honours School]]s in Oxford. It was also possible to obtain "double firsts" at [[Honour Moderations]]. Today, the expression is used at Cambridge to describe first-class honours "in two sets of examinations corresponding to two different Parts of Triposes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html |title=CamDATA: course information and statistics |publisher=University of Cambridge |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> The term "double first" is also sometimes informally used to describe first-class honours in both Honour Moderations and the Final Honour School in Oxford in the same subject, but this usage is considered improper by some writers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Balsdon |first1=Dacre |authorlink1=John Percy Vyvian Dacre Balsdon |title=Oxford Now and Then |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HDY8AAAAIAAJ |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate=2010-10-16 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1970 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Duckworth |location=London |isbn= |page=20 |pages= |at= |quote=The expression is used legitimately today of anyone who takes a First in two Final Honours Schools, say in Lit. Hum. and in Law. It is improperly used of a man who takes Firsts in Moderations and Finals.}}</ref> Such "double firsts" are unknown in subjects where Moderations or a Preliminary Examination are sat instead of Honour Moderations, because no honours are awarded - the highest award in those exams is known instead as a distinction. A "double first" can also signify that a candidate has achieved [[First Class Honours]] in both subjects of a [[Joint Honours]] degree. ====Aegrotat==== A candidate who is unable to take his or her exams because of illness can sometimes be awarded an [[aegrotat]] degree; this is an honours degree without classification, awarded on the understanding that had the candidate been well, he or she would have passed. ==International comparisons== An approximate mapping between UK classifications and [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|US Grade Point Averages]] can be inferred from the [[University College London]] graduate admissions criteria.<ref name="UCL GPA">[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate-study/application-admission/general-entrance-requirement General entrance requirements], ''[[University College London]]''</ref> Canadian GPAs differ; the ''UK Graduate Admissions Fact Sheet'' from [[McGill University]] states that in their system, where standings are reported in lieu of an average, a CGPA (cumulative grade point average) is determined.<ref name="McGill equiv">[http://www.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/apply/prepare/requirements/internationaldegree/europe/ Future graduate students: European Fact Sheets], ''[[McGill University]]''</ref> However, different universities convert grades differently. UCL's system is at odds with [[London School of Economics and Political Science|LSE]], which for example considers GPA (US) of 3.5 as equivalent to a 2.1.<ref name="LSE entrance requirement">[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/entryRequirements/Home.aspx#generated-subheading1 International entrance requirement]''[[London School of Economics and Political Science|LSE]]''</ref> Also most Oxbridge departments consider a 3.8 the equivalent of a First; see for instance English Language and Literature post graduate requirement at Oxford.<ref name="Oxford English Language and Literature entrance requirement">[http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate_courses/course_guide/english_language_.html Oxford Prospectus 2010/2011]''[[Oxford University]]''</ref> Grade equivalents given by [[WES]],<ref name="WES conversion">[http://www.wes.org/gradeconversionguide/index.asp: WES GPA conversion ]''[WES]''</ref> World Educational Services, which provide qualification conversion services to many Universities, also converts UK degrees to higher GPAs than the conversion used by UCL, if the guidelines for converting grades to GPA given by [[Duke University]]<ref name="Duke grade to GPA conversion">[http://gradschool.duke.edu/admissions/requirements/ugpa.php Calculation of GPA using Grades]''[[Duke University]]''</ref> are used. Another comparison of UK degree with US used by [[Carnegie Mellon]], [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], [[Texas A & M University]], [[CHN University Netherlands]], [[Georgetown University]] and [[University of Exeter]] can be seen here.<ref name="Exeter comparison">[http://offices.exeter.ac.uk/international/staff/Qualifications_Guide/qatar.shtml]''Exeter University International Comparisons''</ref> Interestingly, this conversion is very similar to that given by WES and Duke, and that used by LSE and Oxbridge. It should be noted that there is no hard and fast rule of converting the degrees, as obviously different institutions compare differently. {|border="1" cellpadding="4" |- ! scope="col" style="background:#efefef;" | UK Class ! scope="col" style="background:#efefef;" | US GPA ! scope="col" style="background:#efefef;" | Pakistan GPA ! scope="col" style="background:#efefef;" | Secured Marks Level |- ! scope="row" style="background:#efefef;"
