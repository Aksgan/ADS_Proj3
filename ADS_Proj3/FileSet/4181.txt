By adjusting the path length while observing the [[interference pattern]] and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (''λ'') can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equation ''c'' = ''λf''.

The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry.<ref name="NIST_pub"> {{Cite book |title=A Century of Excellence in Measurements, Standards, and Technology |editor-last=Lide |editor-first=DR |contribution=Speed of Light from Direct Frequency and Wavelength Measurements |last=Sullivan |first=DB |year=2001 |pages=191–193 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0849312477 |url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/sp958-lide/191-193.pdf }}</ref> This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (which later became [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]).
