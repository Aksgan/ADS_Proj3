[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5388716.stm Classical music fans go digital], 2006-09-28.</ref> The site facilitates interaction between [[musicians]], students, presenters, managers, journalists, media, instrument makers and dealers. Classical music enthusiasts and audience members are also encouraged to participate. Members of the site can share their music and generally network with the broad classical music community. ==History== Classical Lounge was founded in August 2006 by the members of the Miro [[String quartet|Quartet]]. Since then, it has gained several thousand members. In September 2006, the PalmBeachPost.com called it "essentially a [[MySpace]]-style deal for classical players, composers, critics and enthusiast".<ref>PalmBeachPost.com.

However, not all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are continuous. If a function is not continuous at a point in its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]], one says that it has a '''discontinuity''' there. The set of all points of discontinuity of a function may be a [[discrete set]], a [[dense set]], or even the entire domain of the function. This article describes the '''classification of discontinuities''' in the simplest case of functions of a single [[real number|real]] variable taking real values. ==Classification of discontinuities== Consider a real valued function ''&fnof;'' of a real variable ''x'', defined in a neighborhood of the point ''x''<sub>0</sub> in which ''&fnof;'' is discontinuous. Then three situations may be distinguished: <ol> <li>The [[one-sided limit]] from the negative direction :<math>L^{-}=\lim_{x\rarr x_0^{-}} f(x)</math> and the one-sided limit from the positive direction :<math>L^{+}=\lim_{x\rarr x_0^{+}} f(x)</math> at <math>x_0</math> exist, are finite, and are equal to <math>L=L^{-}=L^{+}</math>. Then, if ''&fnof;''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) is not equal to <math>L</math>, ''x''<sub>0</sub> is called a '''removable discontinuity'''. This discontinuity can be 'removed to make ''&fnof;'' continuous at ''x''<sub>0</sub>', or more precisely, the function :<math>g(x) = \begin{cases}f(x) & x\ne x_0 \\ L & x = x_0\end{cases}</math> is continuous at ''x''=''x''<sub>0</sub>. <li>The limits <math>L^{-}</math> and <math>L^{+}</math> exist and are finite, but not equal. Then, ''x''<sub>0</sub> is called a '''jump discontinuity''' or '''step discontinuity'''. For this type of discontinuity, the function ''&fnof;'' may have any value in ''x''<sub>0</sub>. <li>One or both of the limits <math>L^{-}</math> and <math>L^{+}</math> does not exist or is infinite. Then, ''x''<sub>0</sub> is called an '''essential discontinuity''', or '''infinite discontinuity'''. (This is distinct from the term ''[[essential singularity]]'' which is used when studying [[complex analysis|functions of complex variables]].) </ol> The term ''removable discontinuity'' is sometimes incorrectly used for cases in which the limits in both directions exist and are equal, while the function is [[defined and undefined|undefined]] at the point <math>x_0.</math><ref>See, for example, the last sentence in the definition given at Mathwords.[http://www.mathwords.com/r/removable_discontinuity.htm]</ref> This use is improper because [[Continuous function|continuity]] and discontinuity of a function are concepts defined only for points in the function's domain. Such a point not in the domain, is properly named a [[removable singularity]]. The [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] of a function at a point quantifies these discontinuities as follows: * in a removable discontinuity, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation; * in a jump discontinuity, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value ''at'' the point lies between these limits from the two sides); * in an essential discontinuity, oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist. ==Examples== [[Image:Discontinuity_removable.eps.png|thumb|left|The function in example 1, a removable discontinuity]] 1. Consider the function :<math>f(x)=\begin{cases}x^2 & \mbox{ for } x< 1 \\ 0 & \mbox { for } x=1 \\ 2-x& \mbox{ for } x>1\end{cases}</math> Then, the point <math>x_0=1</math> is a '''removable discontinuity'''. {{clear}} [[Image:Discontinuity_jump.eps.png|thumb|left|The function in example 2, a jump discontinuity]] 2. Consider the function :<math>f(x)=\begin{cases}x^2 & \mbox{ for } x< 1 \\ 0 & \mbox { for } x=1 \\ 2-(x-1)^2& \mbox{ for } x>1\end{cases}</math> Then, the point <math>x_0=1</math> is a '''jump discontinuity'''. {{clear}} [[Image:Discontinuity_essential.eps.png|thumb|left|The function in example 3, an essential discontinuity]] 3. Consider the function :<math>f(x)=\begin{cases}\sin\frac{5}{x-1} & \mbox{ for } x< 1 \\ 0 & \mbox { for } x=1 \\ \frac{0.1}{x-1}& \mbox{ for } x>1\end{cases}</math> Then, the point <math>x_0=1</math> is an '''essential discontinuity (sometimes called infinite discontinuity)'''. For it to be an essential discontinuity, it would have sufficed that only one of the two one-sided limits did not exist or were infinite. However, given this example the discontinuity is also an ''essential discontinuity'' for the extension of the function into complex variables. {{clear}} ==The set of discontinuities of a function== The set of points at which a function is continuous is always a [[G-delta set|G<sub>δ</sub> set]]. The set of discontinuities is an [[F-sigma set|F<sub>σ</sub> set]]. The set of discontinuities of a [[monotonic function]]
