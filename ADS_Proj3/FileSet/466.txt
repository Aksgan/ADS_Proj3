Since all blogs are on the internet by definition, they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked, through [[blogroll]]s, comments, [[linkback]]s (refbacks, trackbacks or pingbacks) and [[backlink]]s. Discussions "in the blogosphere" are occasionally used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues. Because new, untapped communities of bloggers can emerge in the space of a few years, [[Internet marketing|Internet marketers]] pay close attention to "trends in the blogosphere".<ref>See for instance: *{{cite news | last = Mesure | first = Susie | title = Is it a diary?

The designated date is August 31, because when written 3108, it resembles the word "Blog". On that day, bloggers recommend five new blogs to their visitors, so that readers discover new, previously unknown blogs. ;[[List of search engines#Blog|Blog search engines]]: Several blog search engines are used to search blog contents, such as [[Bloglines]], [[BlogScope]], and [[Technorati]].

For instance, [[Blogster]] has a sizable community of political bloggers among its members. ;Blogging and [[advertising]]: It is common for blogs to feature advertisements either to financially benefit the blogger or to promote the blogger's favorite causes.

There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e. [[blogroll]]). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, [[permalinks]] can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.<ref>Marlow, C.

Presented at the International Communication Association Conference, May, 2004, New Orleans, LA.</ref> The [[blogdex]] project was launched by researchers in the [[MIT Media Lab]] to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs in order to investigate their social properties. It gathered this information for over 4 years, and autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community, ranking it by recency and popularity. It can therefore be considered the first instantiation
