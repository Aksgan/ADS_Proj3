He is a co-founder and member of the Board of Directors of Infosys Technologies Limited. Shibu, as he is fondly called, has over three decades of IT leadership experience. He has played a pivotal role in the Infosys journey and was instrumental in the evolution of the Global Delivery Model which is now the de-facto industry standard for delivery for outsourced IT services. Shibu is famous as a gadget freak within Infosys. The story goes that when Kumari Shibulal first entered her marital home in Alleppey, Kerala, her father-in-law, the late C.K. Damodaran, welcomed the young bride with an unusual gift. He gave her a small, beat-up radio, with a tangle of wires sticking out from its case, and said, "This is what your husband made as a boy." Turning the dial, he smiled, "Look, it still works!" According to a newspaper article, Shibu recently cobbled together two devices, Slingbox and TiVo, so that his daughter Shruti can enjoy her favourite TV shows live from the US, in their Bangalore home. The fascination with technology started during childhood for Shibu. At TD High School in Alleppey in the 1970s, Shibu would pore over diagrams in the magazine, Science Student, using them to build motion and sound sensors that would turn on a light, or a small fan. Later, living in the US on a shoestring budget, Shibu simply couldn't afford gadgets, so he assembled them with different parts from a RadioShack store. Even before PDAs were invented, Shibu had one which he integrated himself. "When I have a need, I figure out a solution and integrate it. Now, I do it almost by intuition," he told a newspaper interviewer. Among Shibu's favourite devices is his PDA. It's a large screen, a mini notebook, a mobile phone, with mobile Internet and GPS, all rolled into one. Shibu started his Infosys journey in 1981 by leading its project management, followed by client relationships in North American for a decade. He followed this with a five-year sabbatical with Sun Microsystems between 1991 and 1996, where he was responsible for designing and implementing their first e-commerce application. In 1997, on his return to Infosys, Shibu established and headed the Internet Consultancy practice. He moved on to serve several leadership roles at the group level, first as the Worldwide Head of Customer Delivery and later as Group Head, Worldwide Sales and Customer Delivery. On June 22, 2007, Shibu took over from S. Gopalakrishnan as Chief Operating Officer. According to the company website, Shibu's focus has been on increasing competitiveness, improving customer experience, enhancing employee engagement and increasing the depth of services. Shibu received a master's degree in Physics from the University of Kerala and a MS in Computer Science from the University of Boston. He is a member of several international forums, namely the International Board of Foundation, Globethics.net, the global Corporate Governance Forum's Private Sector Advisory Group and the Metropolitan College Dean's advisory Board, Boston University. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.infosys.com/about/management-profiles/Pages/s-shibulal.aspx Management profile at Infosys] {{india-business-bio-stub}} [[Category:Boston University alumni]] [[Category:Indian computer scientists]] [[Category:People from Kerala]] [[Category:University of Kerala alumni]] [[Category:Infosys]] [[Category:Living people]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32662</id> <title>S3 Texture Compression</title> <text>'''S3 Texture Compression''' ('''S3TC''') (sometimes also called '''DXTn''' or '''DXTC''') is a group of related [[lossy compression|lossy]] [[texture compression]] [[algorithm]]s originally developed by Iourcha et al. of [[S3 Graphics|S3 Graphics, Ltd.]] <ref>{{patent|US|5956431|"Fixed-rate block-based image compression with inferred pixel values"}}</ref> for use in their [[Savage 3D]] computer graphics accelerator. The method of compression is strikingly similar to the previously published [[Color Cell Compression]] <ref>1990 IEEE Color Cell Compression Paper[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/498/3989/00152671.pdf]</ref> which is in turn an adaptation of [[Block Truncation Coding]] published in the late 70s. Unlike some image compression algorithms (e.g. JPEG), S3TC's fixed-rate data compression coupled with the single memory access (cf. Color Cell Compression and some [[Vector quantization|VQ]]-based schemes) made it ideally suited for use in compressing [[texture mapping|textures]] in hardware accelerated [[3D computer graphics]]. Its subsequent inclusion in [[Microsoft]]'s [[DirectX]] 6.0 led to widespread adoption of the technology among hardware and software makers. While S3 Graphics is no longer a leading competitor in the graphics accelerator market, license fees are still levied and collected for the use of S3TC technology, for example in [[game console]]s. ==Codecs== There are five variations of the S3TC algorithm (named '''DXT1''' through '''DXT5''', referring to the [[FOURCC]] code assigned by Microsoft to each format), each designed for specific types of image data. All convert a 4x4 block of pixels to a 64-[[bit]] or 128-bit quantity, resulting in compression ratios of 8:1 or 4:1 with 32-bit [[RGBA]] input data. S3TC is a [[lossy data compression|lossy]] compression algorithm, resulting in image quality degradation, an effect which is minimized by the ability to increase texture resolutions while maintaining the same memory requirements. Hand-drawn cartoon-like images do not compress well, nor do [[normal map]] data, both of which usually generate [[Compression artifacts|artifacts]]. [[ATI Technologies|ATI]]'s [[3Dc]] compression algorithm is a modification of DXT5 designed to overcome S3TC's shortcomings with regard to normal
