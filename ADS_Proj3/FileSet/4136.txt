part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the [[umbra]] passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. The Sun's distance from the Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's [[diameter]] is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 [[degree of arc]] in angular measure. [[File:NASA-solar eclipse STEREO-B.ogg|thumb|The Moon transiting in front of the Sun as seen from [[STEREO|STEREO-B]] on February 25, 2007 at 4.4 times the distance between the Earth and the Moon.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NASA - Stereo Eclipse |publisher=NASA |url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/12mar_stereoeclipse.htm}}</ref>]] The Moon's orbit around the Earth is an [[ellipse]], as is the Earth's orbit around the Sun; the apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon therefore vary.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Solar Eclipses |publisher=University of Tennessee |url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/eclipses.html }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=P. Tiedt |title=Types of Solar Eclipse |url=http://www.eclipse.za.net/html/eclipse_types.html}}</ref> The [[magnitude of an eclipse]] is the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent size of the Sun during an eclipse. An eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its closest distance to the Earth (i.e., near its [[perigee]]) can be a total eclipse because the Moon will appear to be large enough to cover completely the Sun's bright disk, or [[photosphere]]; a total eclipse has a magnitude greater than 1. Conversely, an eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its farthest distance from the Earth (i.e., near its [[apogee]]) can only be an annular eclipse because the Moon will appear to be slightly smaller than the Sun; the magnitude of an annular eclipse is less than 1. Slightly more solar eclipses are annular than total because, on average, the Moon lies too far from Earth to cover the Sun completely. A hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from smaller than one to larger than one—or vice versa—so the eclipse appears to be total at some locations on Earth and annular at other locations.<ref>{{Cite web|author=O. Staiger |title=Solar Eclipses for Beginners |url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html}}</ref> Because the Earth's orbit around the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's distance from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon in the same way, but not so much as the Moon's varying distance from the Earth. When the Earth approaches its [[Aphelion|farthest distance from the Sun]] in July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when the Earth approaches its [[perihelion|closest distance to the Sun]] in January. ===Terminology for central eclipse=== ''Central eclipse'' is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse.<ref>{{Cite web|author=F. Espenak |title=Central Solar Eclipses |url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEpath/SEpath.html}}</ref> The next non-central solar eclipse will be on April 29, 2014. This will be an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.<ref>{{Cite web|author=F. Verbelen |title=Solar Eclipses on Earth, 1001 BC to AD 2500 |url=http://users.online.be/felixverbelen/catzeute.htm}}</ref> The phases observed during a total eclipse are called: * First Contact — when the moon's shadow first becomes visible on the solar disk. Some also name individual phases between First and Second Contact e.g. Pac-Man phase. * Second Contact — starting with Baily's Beads {caused by light shining through valleys on the moon's surface} and the Diamond Ring. Almost the entire disk is covered. * Totality — with the shadow of the moon obscuring the entire disk of the sun and only the corona visible * Third Contact — when the first bright light becomes visible and the shadow is moving away from the sun. Again a Diamond Ring may be observed ==Predictions== ===Geometry=== [[Image:Solar eclipse.svg|thumb|upright|Diagram of solar eclipse (not to scale)]] The diagram to the right shows the alignment of the Sun, Moon and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region below the Moon is the [[umbra]], where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches the Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the [[penumbra]], in which only a partial and annular eclipses can be seen. The [[Orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the [[ecliptic]]). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass above or below the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when the new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as [[Orbital node|node]]s) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic. As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also [[ellipse|elliptical]]. The Moon's distance from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its distance from the Earth, and it is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its [[perigee]]) that a total eclipse occurs.<ref>{{Cite web|author=R.
