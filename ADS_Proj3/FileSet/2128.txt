Logik Grundlagen Math 12 (1966) 279-294</ref> In their view Church's recursive function definition was too restrictive in that it read the elements in order. Instead they proposed a rule based on a partially computable process which having read ''any'' N elements of the sequence, decides if it wants to select another element which has not been read yet. The principle influenced modern concepts in randomness, e.g. the work by [[A. N. Kolmogorov]] in considering a finite sequence random (with respect to a class of computing systems) if any program that can generate the sequence is at least as long as the sequence itself.<ref>''An introduction to probability and inductive logic'' 2001 by Ian Hacking ISBN 0521775019 page 145</ref><ref>''Creating modern probability'' by Jan Von Plato 1998 ISBN 0521597358 pages 23-24</ref> ==See also== * [[History of randomness]] ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Randomness]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18029</id> <title>Impredicativity</title> <text>In [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], '''impredicativity''' is the property of a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. More precisely, a definition is said to be '''impredicative''' if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set which contains the thing being defined. [[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction, namely the set of all sets which do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is whether such a set contains itself or not &mdash; if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should. The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set ''X'', glb(''X''), also has an impredicative definition; ''y'' = glb(''X'') if and only if for all elements ''x'' of ''X'', ''y'' is less than or equal to ''x'', and any ''z'' less than or equal to all elements of ''X'' is less than or equal to ''y''. But this definition also quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of ''X'', one of which being the glb itself. Hence predicativism would reject this definition.<ref>Kleene 1952:42-43</ref> == History == The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)<ref>dates derived from Kleene 1952:42</ref> and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets which do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''. The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''<ref>van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113</ref> and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901<ref>Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124</ref> with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following: : "On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate".<ref>Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23</ref> In other words, given ''f''(''a'') the function ''f'' is the variable and ''a'' is the invariant part. So why not subsititute the value ''f''(''a'') for ''f'' itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that: :"You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let ''w'' be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can ''w'' be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that ''w'' is not a predicate. Likewise there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality".<ref>Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125</ref> Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem: :"Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic".<ref>Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127</ref> While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which makes use of the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics (1903)'' and is discussed there in great detail...".<ref>van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russel's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124</ref> Russell, after 6 years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".<ref>Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''</ref> But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters. The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite. [[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 ''A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering'' presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued
