[[computer chess|programs]] search winning captures and "[[killer heuristic|killers]]" first. LMR will reduce the search depth for moves searched later at a given node. This allows the program to search deeper along the critical lines, and play better. Most chess programs will search the first several moves at a node to full depth. Often, they do not reduce moves considered to be very tactical, such as captures or promotions. This search reduction can lead to a different search space than the pure alpha-beta method which can give different results. Care must be taken to select the reduction criteria or the search will miss some deep threats. ==External links== * [http://www.glaurungchess.com/lmr.html An Introduction to Late Move Reductions] [[Category:Search algorithms]] [[Category:Computer chess]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21212</id> <title>Latent typing</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|orphan =February 2009|unreferenced =December 2007|context =October 2009}} In [[computer programming]], '''latent typing''' (as opposed to [[eager typing]] or [[manifest typing]]) is a style of [[Type system|typing]] that does not require (or perhaps even offer) explicit [[Declaration (computer science)|type declaration]]s. Latent typing is heavily associated with [[duck typing]] and [[dynamic typing]] at [[Run time (computing)|runtime]], but may also be achieved by [[type inference]] and [[static typing]] at [[compile time]]. A related term, '''implicit typing''', also covers static type-inference systems with few or no annotations. ==See also== * [[Duck typing]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Latent Typing}} [[Category:Data types]] {{compu-lang-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>21224</id> <title>Latin letters used in mathematics</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} __NOTOC__ Many letters of the [[Latin alphabet]], both capital and small, are used in [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]] to denote by convention specific or abstracted constants, variables of a certain type, units, multipliers, physical entities.
