It was put forth in 1921 by [[Germany|German]] physicist [[Heinrich Georg Barkhausen]] (1881-1956). It is widely used in the design of [[electronic oscillator]]s, and also in the design of general [[negative feedback]] circuits such as [[op amp]]s, to prevent them from oscillating. ==Limitations== Barkhausen's criterion applies to linear circuits with a [[feedback loop]]. Therefore it cannot be applied to one port [[negative resistance]] active elements like [[tunnel diode]] oscillators. ==Criterion== It states that if <math>A \,</math> is the [[gain]] of the amplifying element in the circuit and <math>\beta(j\omega)\,</math> is the [[transfer function]] of the feedback path, so <math>\beta A\,</math> is the [[loop gain]] around the [[feedback loop]] of the circuit, the circuit will sustain steady-state oscillations only at frequencies for which: #The loop gain is equal to unity in absolute magnitude, that is, <math>|\beta A| = 1\,;</math> #There must be a positive feedback i.e., the [[phase shift]] around the loop is zero or an integer multiple of 2π: <math>\angle \beta A = 2 \pi n, n \in 0, 1, 2,\dots\,.</math> Barkhausen's criterion is a ''necessary'' condition for oscillation, not ''sufficient''. This means there are some circuits which satisfy the criterion but do not oscillate. Unfortunately these can not be distinguished with the [[Nyquist stability criterion]]. The Nyquist stability criterion in its general form only indicates instability but cannot provide any information if this instability will cause oscillations or not. Thus, there seems to be still no compact formulation of an oscillation criterion that is both necessary as well as sufficient, ref. [1]. ==Erroneous version== Barkhausen's original "formula for self-excitation", intended for determining the oscillation frequencies of the feedback loop, involved an equality sign: |β''A''| = 1. At the time conditionally-stable nonlinear systems were poorly understood; it was widely believed that this gave the boundary between stability (|β''A''| < 1) and instability (|β''A''| ≥ 1), and this erroneous version found its way into the literature.<ref>{{cite web | last = Lundberg | first = Kent | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Barkhausen Stability Criterion | work = [http://web.mit.edu/klund/www/ Kent Lundberg faculty website] | publisher = MIT | date = 2002-11-14 | url = http://web.mit.edu/klund/www/weblatex/node4.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-11-16}}</ref> However, ''stable'' oscillations only occur at frequencies for which equality holds. == See also == *[[Nyquist stability criterion]] == Notes == <references/> == References == [1] Lutz von Wangenheim, "On the Barkhausen and Nyquist stability criteria", Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, DOI 10.1007/s10470-010-9506-4 Received: 17 June 2010 / Revised: 2 July 2010 / Accepted: 5 July 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 ISSN: 1573-1979 (electronic version) [2] Lindberg, Erik, "The Barkhausen Criterion (Observation ?)", part of: Proceedings of NDES 2010, pages: 15-18, IEEE Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics of Electronic Systems (NDES2010), 26 – 28 May 2010, Dresden, Germany, http://www.ndes2010.org/ [[Category:Oscillation]] [[Category:Electronic circuits]] [[hi:बार्कहाउजेन कसौटी]] [[sv:Barkhausen-kriteriet]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3372</id> <title>Barrett reduction</title> <text>In [[modular arithmetic]], '''Barrett reduction''' is a reduction [[algorithm]] introduced in 1986 by P.D.

[[Paul Erdős]] is the main founder of this branch of number theory. Typical topics include [[covering system]], [[zero-sum problem]]s, various [[restricted sumset]]s, and [[arithmetic progression]]s in a set of integers. Algebraic or analytic methods are powerful in this field. In combinatorial number theory, the '''barycentric-sum problems''' are questions that can be answered using combinatorial techniques. The context of barycentric-sum problems are the barycentric sequences. ==Example== Let <math>Z_n</math> be the cyclic group of integers modulo ''n''. Let ''S'' be a sequence of elements of <math>Z_n</math>, where the repetition of elements is allowed. Let <math>|S|</math> be the length of ''S''. A sequence <math>S \subseteq Z_n</math> with <math>|S| \geq 2</math> is barycentric or has a barycentric-sum if it contains one element <math>a_j</math> such that <math>\sum\limits_ {a_i \in S} a_i=|S|a_j</math>. Informally, if <math>S</math> contains one element <math>a_j</math>, which is the ”average” of its terms. A barycentric sequence of length <math>t</math> is called a t-barycentric sequence.
