all cases, the air has to be cooler than the object or surface from which it is expected to remove heat. This is due to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat will only move spontaneously from a hot reservoir (the heat sink) to a cold reservoir (the air). ==Examples== [[File:R68-opposed-cylinders.jpg|thumb|Air-cooled [[Flat engine|''boxer'']] engine on a [[History of BMW motorcycles|1954 BMW motorcycle]]]] ===Vehicles=== Air is mainly used for [[Air-cooled engine | cooling]] [[internal combustion engines]] (ICE), particularly those powering aircraft, because it is a readily available fluid and is often at a suitable temperature to be used efficiently. While many such ICE are called "''liquid cooled''" the cooling liquid is usually cooled by air passing through a [[radiator]] or [[heat exchanger]]. Examples of direct air cooling in [[automobile]]s are rarer. The most common example is the [[Flat engine|flat or ''Boxer'' engine]], once used extensively by [[Porsche]] and still in use on [[BMW Motorrad|BMW motorcycles]]. Notable past models include the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and related models, the [[Citroën 2CV]], the [[Chevrolet Corvair]], and the [[Porsche 911]] until 1998. ===Turbines=== Gas turbine engines (e.g. turbojets, turbofans, etc) incorporate turbines, which are exposed to the hot gases exiting the combustion chamber. Where necessary, relatively cold air is bled from the compression system and used to cool the turbine blades and vanes, to prevent them from melting. ===Electronics=== Its use is widespread in computers and [[CPU cooling]], where the computer [[central processing unit|processor]]s produce large quantities of heat that, if not dissipated, could damage the CPU and other electronic components. In this case air has the advantage of being a good [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] too. However, in the future, new processors might generate too much heat to be dissipated through direct air cooling and it would follow that such direct cooling for computers and their components will become obsolete. [[Water cooling]] is somewhat popular in very high-power situations, such as large servers or heavily overclocked amateur systems. ===Industries=== A very large number of [[industry|industrial]] processes use air as a cooling medium, either directly or indirectly. [[Air conditioning]] is a very common process in which the air in a room, or a whole building, is cooled in order to maintain a comfortable environment for its occupants. Often the air has been cooled by chilled water or [[brine]] and the heat transferred to that medium is transported outside the building where, often, fan-driven water-to-air [[heat exchanger | heat exchanging]] is again effected to reject the heat into the atmosphere. A common sight around, for example, [[power station]]s are the large waisted concrete towers that emit steam more or less constantly. These are, in part, using air cooling on a grand scale. ==See also== *[[Computer cooling]] *[[Computer fan]] *[[Evaporative cooling]] *[[Water cooling]] *[[Oil cooling]] *[[Heat pipe]] cooling *[[Peltier-Seebeck effect|Peltier]] cooling *[[Heater core]] ==External links== *[http://www.heatsinkfactory.com/air-cooling-faq-sp-5.html A basic Air Cooling FAQ] [[Category:Engine cooling systems]] [[Category:Cooling technology]] [[Category:Computer hardware cooling]] [[de:Luftkühlung]] [[es:Refrigeración por aire]] [[eo:Peraera malvarmigo]] [[fr:Refroidissement à air]] [[ko:공랭]] [[nl:Luchtkoeling]] [[ja:空冷]] [[ta:காற்று குளிர்வித்தல்]] [[zh:風冷]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1267</id> <title>Air source heat pumps</title> <text><!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:air_source_heat_pump_principle.jpg||200px|thumb|A visual representation of the air source heat pump principle|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 23 January 2008}}]] --> {{Essay-like|date=August 2010}} {{Debate|date=January 2011}} An '''air source [[heat pump]]''' uses outside air as a heat source or heat sink. A compressor, condenser and refrigerant system is used to absorb heat at one place and release it at another. ==General== Outside [[air]], necessarily existing at some temperature above [[absolute zero]], is a heat container. An air-source heat pump moves ("pumps") some of this heat to provide hot water or household heating. This can be done in either direction, to cool or heat the interior of a building. The main components of an air-source heat pump are: * a heat exchanger, over which outside air is blown, to extract the heat from the air * a compressor, which acts like a refrigerator but in reverse and raises the temperature from the outside air * a way to transfer the heat into a hot water tank or heating system, such as radiators or under-floor heating tubes ==How air source heat pumps work== [[File:Refrigerator-cycle.svg|thumb|A: indoor compartment, B: outdoor compartment, I: insulation, 1: condenser, 2: expansion valve, 3: evaporator, 4: compressor]] Heating and cooling is accomplished by moving a [[refrigerant]] through the heat pump's various indoor and outdoor [[coil]]s and components. A [[gas compressor|compressor]], [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], [[expansion valve]] and [[evaporator]] are used to change states of the refrigerant from a [[liquid]] to hot [[gas]] and from a gas to a cold liquid. The refrigerant is used to heat or cool coils in a [[building]] or [[room]] and [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] pull the room air over the coils. An external outdoor [[heat exchanger]] is used to heat or cool the refrigerant. This use of outside [[air]] has led to the term "Air Source" Heat Pump. The overall operation uses the concepts described in classic [[vapor compression refrigeration]]. When the liquid refrigerant at a low [[temperature]] passes through the outdoor evaporator coils, the temperature of the outside air causes the liquid to boil. This change of state from liquid to a vapor requires a considerable amount of [[energy]] or "[[latent heat]]" which is provided by outside air passing over the coils. This [[vapor]] is then drawn into the compressor where the temperature of the vapor is boosted to well over 100 degrees [[Celsius]]. At this point we have used heat from the outside air to change the liquid refrigerant to a gas and added an amount of compression "work" to raise the temperature of the vapor. The vapor now enters the condenser heat exchanger coils where it begins to transfer heat to the air being drawn across the coils. As the vapor cools, it condenses back to a liquid and in so doing releases and transfers considerable latent heat to the air passing over the condenser unit coils. We have used the heat energy of outside air to change the phase of the refrigerant and then released this heat for heating, a
