two types. WE/SS compatible plugs are available from a large number of manufacturers, whereas Tyco/AMP plugs are produced exclusively by [[Tyco Electronics]]. Both types of modular plugs will plug into the same standard 8P8C modular jack. WE/SS and Tyco/AMP 8P8C plugs have different spacing for the cable strain relief.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.belfuse.com/Data/Datasheets/CT300064.pdf | title = Stewart Connector 937-SP-3088 - Eight conductor/eight position line cord module | accessdate = 2009-09-10 | date = 2006-02-01 | format = PDF | publisher = Bel Stewart Connector | location = [[Glen Rock, Pennsylvania]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tycoelectronics.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=showdoc&DocId=Customer+Drawing%7F554739%7FP%7Fpdf%7FEnglish%7FENG_CD_554739_P.pdf | title = Tyco/AMP 5-554739-2 - Modular plug assembly, 8 position, flat oval cable | accessdate = 2009-09-10 | date = 2008-03-31 | format = PDF | publisher = Tyco Electronics Corporation | location = [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] }}</ref> As a result, using a WE/SS 8P8C crimp dieset on a Tyco/AMP 8P8C plug will crush the top of the connector, and vice versa. While the WE/SS compatible plug is produced by a larger number of manufacturers than the Tyco/AMP plug, it is still important to know what style is being used to avoid damaging the plug during crimping. Both types of 8P8C plugs are available in shielded and unshielded varieties, depending on the [[attenuation]] tolerance needed. Shielded plugs are more expensive and require shielded cable, but have a lower attenuation and can reduce [[signal noise]]. ===Termination=== Termination of a cable with an 8P8C plug involves using a [[Pliers#Crimping pliers|hand crimper]] or crimp machine containing an 8P8C die-set or an A67T{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} standard die-set. An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug. As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching the plug to the cable. There are two sub-types of plug, that differ only in the type of contacts used. One contact suits solid copper cable and the other suits stranded copper cable. The crimper may also permanently deform part of the plug body in such a way that it grips the outer sheath of the cable. This helps to keep the plug securely fastened to the end of the cable, by providing [[strain relief]]. ===Applications=== 8P8C are commonly used in computer networking and telephone applications, where the plug on each end is an 8P8C modular plug wired according to a TIA/EIA standard. Most network communications today are carried over [[Category 5e]] or [[Category 6 cable]] with an 8P8C modular plug crimped on each end. The 8P8C modular connector is also used for [[RS-232]] serial interfaces according to the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]/TIA-561 standard.<ref>http://www.zytrax.com/tech/layer_1/cables/tech_rs232.htm#rj45</ref> This application is commonly used as a console interface on network equipment such as [[Network switch|switches]] and [[router]]s. Other applications include other [[computer network|networking]] services such as [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] and [[t-carrier|T1]]. In floodwired<ref>'''floodwire''' is a chiefly British term for installing communications cables in a massive fashion in anticipation of their eventual use.</ref> environments the center (blue) pair is often used to carry [[telephony]] signals. Where so wired, the physical layout of the 8P8C modular jack allows for the insertion of an [[RJ11]] plug in the center of the jack, provided the RJ11 plug is wired in true compliance with the U.S. telephony standards (RJ11) using the center pair. The formal approach to connect telephony equipment is the insertion of a type-approved converter. The remaining (brown) pair is increasingly used for [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE). Legacy equipment may use just this pair; this conflicts with other equipment as manufacturers used to [[short circuit]] unused pairs to reduce signal [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Some routers/bridges/switches can be powered by the unused 4 lines—blues (+) and browns (−)—to carry current to the unit. There is now a standardized scheme for [[Power over Ethernet]]. Different manufacturers of 8P8C modular jacks arrange for the pins of the 8P8C modular connector jack to be linked to wire connectors (often IDC type terminals) that are in a different physical arrangement from that of other manufacturers: Thus, for example, if a technician is in the habit of connecting the white/orange wire to the "bottom right hand" IDC terminal, which links it to 8P8C modular connector pin 1, in jacks made by other manufacturers this terminal may instead connect to 8P8C modular connector pin 2 (or any other pin). ==10P10C== [[Image:10P10C-socket pinout.svg|thumb|The pin arrangement for a 10P10C socket]] The '''10P10C''' [[modular connector]] is a type of [[electrical connector]]. ===Terminology=== The 10P10C connector is commonly referred to as an '''RJ50''' connector, although this is not a standard [[registered jack]] in the Universal Service Order Codes. The 10P10C is a telephone-style connector featuring 10 pins and 10 connection wires. ===Common Uses=== [[Image:Connector10p10c.jpg|thumb]] The most common uses of the 10P10C connector are in proprietary data transfer systems,<ref>[http://pinoutsguide.com/connector/10_pin_RJ50_10P10C_male_connector.shtml 10 pin RJ50 (10P10C) male connector diagram and applications]</ref> such as the [[Digi International]] Digiboard serial connections.<ref>[http://pinoutsguide.com/Electronics/Digi_portserver_pinout.shtml Digi PortServer TS 10P10C (RJ50) Modular RS-232 pinout]</ref> It is also used to implement the [[RS-232]] and [[RS-485]] connector standards. It is also used in [[American Power Conversion|APC]] [[uninterruptible power supplies]]. In this case, it is a keyed 10P10C plug with a protrusion on the pin 1 side near the back. This connector is also used by some vendors such as [[BOCA]], for expansion modules of their multi-port RS-232C serial boards. For example, [[Cyclades Corporation|Cyclades]] used the pin #1 as a "RI" (Ring Indicator) signal, which is rarely used, allowing an 8P8C connector to be plugged to their 10P10C socket for most applications. The [[Cisco Systems]] STS-10X terminal server featured this connector. [[FordNet]], a five-pair communications networking medium also used the 10P10C between terminals. ==See also== {{Commons category|Modular connectors}} *[[Telephone plug]] *[[Modified Modular Jack]] *[[Registered jack]] *[[Ethernet over twisted pair]] *[[List of registered jacks]] *[[RJ45]] *[[ARJ45]] *[[GG45]] *[[TERA]] *[[BS 6312]]: British equivalent to RJ25 ==References== {{reflist|2}} *ANSI/TIA-968-A: [https://www.part68.org/SecureDocuments/TIA-968-A-Final.pdf Telephone terminal equipment: Technical requirements for connection of terminal
