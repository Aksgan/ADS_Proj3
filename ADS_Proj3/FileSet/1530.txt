The client runs in the [[background (computer software)|background]], utilizing otherwise unused [[central processing unit|CPU]] (or in some cases, [[Graphical Processing Unit|GPU]], see below) power. The older, no longer used version of Folding@home for the CPU could be run as a screen saver, only folding while the user is away. In most modern personal computers, the CPU is rarely used to its full capacity at all times; the Folding@home client takes advantage of this unused processing power. The Folding@home client periodically connects to a [[Server (computing)|server]] to retrieve "work units", which are packets of data upon which to perform calculations. Each completed work unit is then
