unit]], and branch processing unit. The dispatch unit can issue two instructions per cycle. The floating point unit has a three level deep pipeline. [[Out of order execution]] is supported through the use of shadow or rename registers. The completion unit can complete two instructions per cycle in order by copying results from the rename registers to the real registers. Independently, the branch processing unit can complete a branch each cycle. Thus, in theory, the RHPPC processor can complete three instructions per cycle. Within the RHPPC processor there is a 16 kB instruction and a 16 kB data [[CPU cache|L1 caches]] that are 4 way set associative, and support write through or copy-back protocol. A cache line is fixed at eight words. == Fabrication process and packaging == The RHPPC processor is [[Semiconductor fabrication|fabricated]] with Honeywell’s [[SOI]]-V 0.35 µm, four level metal process. Standard cells and custom drop-ins are used. It is packaged in a hermetic, [[aluminium oxide]], 21 x 21 mm [[Surface-mount technology|grid array]] package with 255 (16 x 16) leads. The leads are on 1.27 mm centers. The lead can have either [[Ball grid array|solder balls]], solder columns, or short pins attached. Standard die attach and [[Wire bonding|wire bond]] die interconnect are used. == References == # {{cite conference |first=Gary |last=Brown |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Radiation hardened PowerPC 603e-based single board computer|booktitle=2001 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings |pages=2249–2261 |publisher=IEEE |date=March 10-17, 2001 |location=Big Sky, MT |url= |accessdate= |id= }} # {{cite conference |first=J.P. |last=Lintz |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Single event effects hardening and characterization of Honeywell's RHPPC integrated circuit|booktitle=2003 IEEE Radiation Effects Data Workshop Record |pages=156–164 |publisher=IEEE |date=July 21-25, 2003 |location=Monterey, CA |url= |accessdate= |id= }} [[Category:PowerPC microprocessors]] [[Category:Power Architecture]] [[Category:Avionics computers]] [[Category:Radiation-hardened microprocessors]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31021</id> <title>RLDRAM</title> <text>{{primarysources|date=June 2010}} {{Memory types}} '''Reduced-latency Dynamic random access memory''' '''(RLDRAM)''' is a type of [[Random-access memory|random access memory]] developed by [[Micron Technology]].

It supports [[distributed systems|distribution]], [[interoperability|interworking]], [[Platform (computing)|platform]] and technology independence, and [[porting|portability]], together with an [[enterprise architecture framework]] for the [[specification]] of ODP systems. [[File:RM-ODP viewpoints.jpg|thumb|320px|The RM-ODP [[view model]], which provides five generic and complementary viewpoints on the system and its environment.]] RM-ODP, also named ''ITU-T Rec. X.901-X.904'' and ''ISO/IEC 10746'', is a joint effort by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and the [[ITU-T|Telecommunication Standardization Sector]] (ITU-T) .<ref> A complete and updated list of references to publications related to RM-ODP (books, journal articles, conference papers, etc.) is available at the [http://www.rm-odp.net/publications.html RM-ODP resource site].</ref> == Overview == The RM-ODP is a [[reference model]] based on precise concepts derived from current distributed processing developments and, as far as possible, on the use of [[formal methods|formal description techniques]] for specification of the [[enterprise architecture|architecture]]. Many RM-ODP concepts, possibly under different names, have been around for a long time and have been rigorously described and explained in exact philosophy (for example, in the works of [[Mario Bunge]]) and in [[systems thinking]] (for example, in the works of [[Friedrich Hayek]]). Some of these concepts -- such as [[abstraction]], composition, and [[emergence]] -- have recently been provided with a solid mathematical foundation in [[category theory]]. RM-ODP has four fundamental elements: * an [[Object-oriented analysis and design|object modelling approach]] to system specification; * the specification of a system in terms of separate but interrelated viewpoint specifications; * the definition of a system infrastructure providing [[Transparency (computing)|distribution transparencies]] for system applications; and * a framework for assessing [[Conformance testing|system conformance]]. The RM-ODP family of recommendations and international standards defines a system of interrelated essential concepts necessary to specify [[Open system (computing)|open]] [[distributed systems|distributed]] processing systems and provides a well-developed enterprise architecture framework for structuring the specifications for any large-scale systems including software systems. == History == Much of the preparatory work that led into the adoption of RM-ODP as an ISO standard was carried out by the [[Advanced Networked Systems Architecture]] (ANSA) project. This ran from 1984 until 1998 under the leadership of [[Andrew Herbert]] (now MD of Microsoft Research in Cambridge), and involved a number of major computing and telecommunication companies. Parts 2 and 3 of the RM-ODP were eventually adopted as [[ISO standard]]s in 1996. Parts 1 and 4 were adopted in 1998. == RM-ODP Topics == === RM-ODP standards === RM-ODP consists of four basic [[ITU-T#Series_and_Recommendations|ITU-T Recommendations]] and [[List of ISO standards|ISO/IEC International Standards]]:<ref> In the same series as the RM-ODP are a number of other standards and recommendations for the specification and development of open and distributed system, for which RM-ODP provides a standardization framework: * ITU-T Rec.
