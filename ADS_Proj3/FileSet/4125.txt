Occupational Employment and Wages, November 2004''], Table 1.</ref> Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12|title=Software Engineering|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> Many [[software engineer]]s work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as [[freelancer]]s. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the [[software development process]]. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Specializations include: in industry ([[Requirements analysis|analysts]], [[Software architecture|architects]], [[Software developer|developers]], [[Software testing|testers]], [[technical support]], [[middleware analyst]]s, [[Project management|managers]]) and in academia ([[educator]]s, [[researcher]]s). Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Injuries in these occupations are rare. However, like other workers who spend long periods in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm#training|title=Computer Software Engineers and Computer Programmers|accessdate=2009-12-17}}</ref> ===Certification=== The [[Software Engineering Institute]] offers certifications on specific topics like Security, [[Process improvement]] and [[Software architecture]].<ref>[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/certification/ SEI certification page]</ref> [[Apple certification programs|Apple]], [[Information Technology Architect Certification|IBM]], [[Microsoft Certified Professional|Microsoft]] and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations.

Broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. {{As of|2006}}, the [[IEEE]] had certified over 575 software professionals as a [[Certified Software Development Professional]] (CSDP).<ref name="ieee2006">{{Cite web|author=IEEE Computer Society|url=http://www.ifip.org/minutes/GA2006/Tab18b-US-IEEE.pdf|format=PDF|title=2006 IEEE computer society report to the IFIP General Assembly|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA).<ref>{{Cite web|author=IEEE|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/certification/csda|title=CSDA|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> In the U.K. the [[British Computer Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Chartered IT Professional (CITP)'', available to fully qualified Members (''MBCS''). In Canada the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Information Systems Professional (ISP)''.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Canadian Information Processing Society|url=http://www.cips.ca/standards/isp|title=I.S.P.

The ACM examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s, but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering.<ref name="acm2000">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep_main.pdf|title=A Summary of the ACM Position on Software Engineering as a Licensed Engineering Profession|last=ACM|date=July 17, 2000|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|accessdate=2009-03-03|quote=At its meeting in May 2000, the Council further concluded that the framework of a licensed professional engineer, originally developed for civil engineers, does not match the professional industrial practice of software engineering. Such licensing practices would give false assurances of competence even if the body of knowledge were mature; and would preclude many of the most qualified software engineers from becoming licensed.}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ===Impact of globalization=== The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to the dot com bubble burst of the 1990s. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the [[developed world]] avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of [[offshore outsourcing]] (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by [[Foreign Worker Visa|foreign visa workers]].<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,111202,00.html As outsourcing gathers steam, computer science interest wanes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, [[computer programming]] does appear to have been affected.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm#outlook Computer Programmers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html Software developer growth slows in North America | InfoWorld | News | 2007-03-13 | By Robert Mullins, IDG News Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources in an efficient fashion has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations.<ref>[http://www.cognizant.com/html/content/news/GartnerMQ_Cognizant.pdf Gartner Magic Quadrant]</ref> When Europeans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work.

This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting key human resource sleep patterns. ==Education== A knowledge of [[programming]] is a pre-requisite to becoming a software engineer. In 2004 the [[IEEE Computer Society]] produced the [[SWEBOK]], which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 19759:2004, describing the body of knowledge that they believe should be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Abran |editor1-first= Alain | title = Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | location = Los Alamitos |year= 2005 | isbn = 0769523307 | url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok |accessdate=2010-09-13|origyear= 2004|chapter= Chapter 1: Introduction to the Guide|chapterurl= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/html/ch1 |quote= The total volume of cited literature is intended to be suitable for mastery through the completion of an undergraduate education plus four years of experience.}}</ref> Many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the [[CCSE]], and updated in 2004.<ref>[http://sites.computer.org/ccse/ SE2004 Software Engineering Curriculum]</ref> A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, there were 244 Campus programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.<ref>[http://www.gradschools.com/search-programs/software-engineering] Degree programs in Software Engineering</ref> In addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing
