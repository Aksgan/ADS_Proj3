in the modern Pascal/Object Pascal community. Semi-homemade [[Compact disc|discs]] containing similar contents have been sold in [[China]] and was popular in the early 2000s. However, such discs are now rarely sold probably due to the popularization of [[internet]]. With the development of [[Free Pascal]] and [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], and their introduce of [[Free Component Library]] (FCL) and [[Lazarus Component Library]] (LCL), FCL- and LCL-oriented components are also steadily growing. == References == <references /> == External links == *[http://www.bsdg.org/SWAG/ Main SWAG HTML Index] *[http://wiki.freepascal.org/FCL FCL - Free Pascal wiki] [[Category:Source code]] [[Category:Pascal]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35171</id> <title>South Coast Air Quality Management District</title> <text>The '''South Coast Air Quality Management District''' ('''SCAQMD'''), formed in 1976, is the [[Air pollution#Air quality agencies|air pollution agency]] responsible mainly for regulating [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary sources]] of [[air pollution]] for most of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], and all of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. The main office of the SCAQMD is located in the city of [[Diamond Bar]], [[California]]. The area encompassed by the SCAQMD amounts to about 10,750 [[square mile]]s (27,850 [[square kilometres]]) and is the second most populated area in the [[United States]]. This area has a severe problem with [[smog]] and the SCAQMD has been a leader in the nation's efforts to reduce air pollution [[Air pollution|emission]]s. ==How the SCAQMD operates== The SCAQMD develops, adopts and implements an Air Quality Management Plan for bringing the area into compliance with the clean air standards established by national and state governmental legislation. Air quality and permissible air pollutant emission "rules" are promulgated to reduce emissions from various sources, including specific types of equipment, industrial processes, paints, solvents and certain consumer products. Permits are issued to the pertinent industries and businesses to enforce compliance with the air quality and emission rules, and SCAQMD staff conducts periodic inspections to ensure such compliance. The SCAQMD's rules apply to businesses ranging from large [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[power plant]]s to [[Filling station|gasoline (petrol) fueling stations]] and [[dry cleaning]] plants. There are about 30,000 such businesses operating under SCAQMD permits. In general, the SCAQMD is limited to establishing rules for regulating stationary sources. [[Emission standards]] for mobile sources (automobiles, trucks, buses, railroads, airplanes and marine vessels) are established the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[California Air Resources Board]]. ==How the SCAQMD is organized== The SCAQMD has a ''Governing Board'' of 12 members. Nine of the members are county supervisors and city council members. The remaining three are appointed by California state officials. The chief ''Executive Officer'' of the SCAQMD reports to the Governing Board and the following departments report to the Executive Officer: ===Administrative departments=== * Policy advisor * Legal ** Counsel ** Prosecutor * Public Affairs * Media Relations * Finance * Human Resources * Information Management ===Operational departments=== * Engineering and Compliance * Planning, Rule Development and Area Sources *Science and Technology advancement ==Air quality monitoring network== The SCAQMD also operates an extensive network of air quality monitoring stations (about 40 stations) and issues daily air quality forecasts. The forecasts are made available to the public through newspapers, television, radio, faxed messages to schools, the SCAQMD's internet website, and a toll-free Smog Update telephone line.<ref>[http://www.aqmd.gov/map/MapAQMD2.pdf SCAQMD Air Quality Monitoring and Forecast Map]</ref><ref>[http://www.calepa.ca.gov/childhealth/news/WorkshopApril04/JCassmassi.pdf ''Monitoring, AQI, Standards & Notification, The South Coast Perspective''] Joe Cassmassi, Senior Meteorologist, SCAQMD, April 2004</ref> ==Air quality modeling and air pollution dispersion modeling oversight== The air quality modeling activities of the SCAQMD are one of the functions of the Planning, Rule Development and Area Sources section. That section is also responsible for oversight and commenting upon [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion modeling]] studies performed as part of any environmental impact studies that may be reviewed by or requested by the SCAQMD. The models that may be utilized include:<ref>[http://www.aqmd.gov/ceqa/models.html Air Quality Modeling]</ref> *California Line Source Dispersion Model ([[List of atmospheric dispersion models#U.S. Environmental Protection Agency models|CALINE-4]]) *Industrial Source Complex Short Term ([[ISC3|ISCST3]]) Model *Hotspots Analysis and Reporting Program (HARP) *[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s Air Quality Models *[[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB)'s Air Quality Models ==Funding for the SCAQMD== About 70% of AQMD’s funding is derived from fees paid by the regulated businesses, 20% from motor vehicle registration fees and the balance from other sources such as fines and other penalties assessed for businesses that violate the AQMD's rules. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== *[[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]] *[[Clean Air Act (1990)]] *[[Clean Air Act (1970)]] *[[List of atmospheric dispersion models#U.S. Environmental Protection Agency models|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency dispersion models]] *[[National Ambient Air Quality Standards|NAAQS]] (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) *[[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants|NESHAP]] (National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) *[[PHEV Research Center]] *[[Public Smog]] ==External links== *[http://www.aqmd.gov/ Official SCAQMD website] [[Category:Southern California]] [[Category:Environmental protection agencies]] [[Category:Air dispersion modeling]] [[Category:Special districts of California]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35180</id> <title>Space-based architecture</title> <text>'''Space-Based Architecture''' ('''SBA''') is a [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|software architecture pattern]] for achieving linear [[scalability]] of stateful, high-performance applications using the [[tuple space]] paradigm. It follows many of the principles of [[Representational State Transfer]] (REST), [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) and [[Event-driven architecture]] (EDA), as well as elements of [[grid computing]]. With a space-based architecture, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as processing-units (PU). These units are independent of each other, so that the application can scale by adding more units. The SBA model is closely related to other patterns that have been proved successful in addressing the application scalability challenge, such as [[shared nothing architecture|Shared-Nothing Architecture]], used by Google, Amazon.com and other well-known companies. The model has also been applied by many firms in the securities industry for implementing scalable electronic securities trading applications. ==Components of Space-Based Architecture== An application built on the principles of space-based architecture typically has the following components: * '''Processing Unit''' — the unit of scalability and fail-over. Normally, a processing unit is built out of a [[Plain Old Java Object|POJO]] (Plain Old Java Object) container, such as that provided by the [[Spring Framework]]. * '''Virtual Middleware''' — a
