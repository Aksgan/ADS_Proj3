can be adapted for specific missions such as logistics with the addition of accessories. Lockheed Martin recently released a new product card for a lift assist device that attaches to the HULC system and provides the user with power assisted lift.<ref>http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/mfc/PC/MFC_HULC_PC2.pdf</ref> ===Funding=== The US Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) awarded Lockheed Martin a $1.1M contract in July 2010 for test & evaluation of upgraded HULC units. Laboratory testing is scheduled for early 2011 followed by field trials. ==Technology and features== The HULC is a battery powered, lower extremity exoskeleton. It carries up to 200 lbs, distributed between the front and back of the device. Loads attach the exoskeleton system and are carried by the exoskeleton, bypassing the human operator. The effective forces felt by the operator are dramatically diminished reducing the risk of muscularskeletal injuries. The HULC provides power assistance at the hip and knee joint. The innovative hydraulic architecture is highly efficient enabling the system to run on batteries. Other exoskeleton systems, such as the Raytheon/SARCOS XOS 2 system are tethered to a power generator.<ref>http://www.raytheon.com/newsroom/technology/rtn08_exoskeleton/</ref> Lockheed Martin announced that it is evaluating fuel cell power sources to increase the duration to support a 72 hour mission .<ref>http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2010/0120mfc-hulc.html</ref> HULC is also easy to put on. It arrives folded in a small package, so soldiers just have to stretch out a leg and step into foot beds underneath the boot. Straps then wrap around the thighs, waist and shoulders. [[Sensors]] in the foot pads relay information to an onboard [[microcomputer]] that moves the [[hydraulic system]] to amplify and enhance the wearer's movement. The flexibility of the system allows soldiers to run, walk, kneel, crawl, and even go into low squats.<ref>http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/hulc/HULCVideo2.html</ref> ==Applications== Lockheed Martin originally developed the HULC to assist soldiers during [[combat]]. It could be used to help lift heavy loads while exerting minimal effort, with soldiers currently going into combat with up to 130 pounds of combat gear. Also, it could be used as a framework for body armor or sensor arrays that would allow for better [[situational awareness]] during combat. Lockheed Martin is also exploring exoskeleton designs to support [[Industry|industrial]] and [[medical]] applications.<ref>Lockheedmartin.com</ref> ==See also== *[[Lockheed Martin]] *[[Exoskeleton]] ===Press releases=== *[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2009/MFC_022609_LockheedMartinUnveilsExoskeleton.html Lockheed Martin Unveils Exoskeleton Technology at AUSA Winter Symposium] ==References== <references/> ==External links== * http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/hulc/index.html * [http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/04/06/hulc-exoskeleton.html New Exoskeleton Gives Soldiers Super Strength] * http://www.berkeleybionics.com/Unrestricted/HULC.html [[Category:Lockheed Martin]] [[Category:Robotic exoskeletons]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17085</id> <title>Human visual system model</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|notable=October 2008|refimprove=October 2008}} A '''human visual system model''' (HVS model) is used by [[image processing]], [[video processing]] and [[computer vision]] experts to deal with biological and psychological processes that are not yet fully understood. Such a model is used to simplify the behaviours of what is a very complex system. As our knowledge of the true [[visual system]] improves, the model is updated. It is common to think of "taking advantage" of the HVS model to produce desired effects. Examples of taking advantage of an HVS model include colour television. Originally it was thought that colour television required too high a bandwidth for the then available technology. Then it was noticed that the colour resolution of the HVS was much lower than the brightness resolution; this allowed colour to be squeezed into the signal by [[chroma subsampling]]. Another example is image compression, like [[JPEG]]. Our HVS model says that we cannot see high frequency detail so in JPEG we can quantise these components without a perceptible loss of quality. Similar concepts are applied in [[Audio_data_compression#Lossy_audio_compression| audio compression]], where sound frequencies inaudible to humans are bandpass filtered. Several HVS features are derived from evolution, when we needed to defend ourselves or hunt for food. We often see demonstrations of HVS features when we are looking at optical illusions. ==Assumptions about the HVS== * [[Low-pass filter]] characteristic (limited number of rods in human eye): see [[Mach bands]] * Lack of colour resolution (fewer cones in human eye than rods) * Motion sensitivity ** More sensitive in [[peripheral vision]] ** Stronger than texture sensitivity, e.g. viewing a camouflaged animal * Texture stronger that disparity - 3D depth resolution does not need to be so accurate * Integral Face recognition (babies smile at faces) ** [[Hollow-face illusion| Depth inverted face looks normal]] (facial features overrule depth information) *** Upside down face with inverted mouth and eyes looks normal<ref>[http://www.moillusions.com/2006/09/margaret-thatcher-illusion.html Margaret Thatcher Illusion - Mighty Optical Illusions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Examples of taking advantage of an HVS model== * [[Flicker fusion threshold| Flicker frequency of film and television using persistence of vision to fool viewer into seeing a continuous image]] * [[Interlacing| Interlaced television]] painting half images to give the impression of a higher flicker frequency * Colour television (chrominance at half resolution of luminance corresponding to proportions of rods and cones in eye) * Image compression (difficult to see higher frequencies more harshly quantised) * [[Motion estimation]] (use luminance and ignore colour) ==See also== * [[Visual system]] * [[Visual perception]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Image processing|Computer vision]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17086</id> <title>Humanistic Robotics</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|orphan=February 2009|notability=February 2008|citations missing=February 2008}} '''Humanistic Robotics''' is a company that develops [[land mine]]â€“clearing technology. It is developing the SCAMP- Specialized Compact Automated Manual deminer replacement Platform. This technology uses remote robotics as a platform for surveying, clearing and checking the quality of clearance in [[minefield]]s, while solving a number of issues not addressed by landmine clearing technologies. ==History== The company was started in 2005 by two students: Samuel Reeves, an undergraduate business student at [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]]; and Joshua Koplin, a graduate design student at the [[Pratt Institute]]. After receiving a grant from a foundation in Geneva, the two partners conducted research in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Thailand and Canada to better understand the landmine clearing technologies in use. Upon their return, they looked for an alternative solution to landmine clearance. Issues that were identified in current landmine clearing machines were high cost (reducing the volume of machines that can be financed), weight (transportation costs and damage caused to rural infrastructure), and ease of use.
