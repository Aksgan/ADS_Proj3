September 1973. At GCHQ, Cocks was told about [[James H. Ellis]]' "[[non-secret encryption]]" and further that since it had been suggested in the late 1960s, no one had been able to find a way to actually implement the concept. Cocks was intrigued, thought about it overnight, and invented, in 1973, what has become known as the [[RSA]] encryption algorithm, realising Ellis' idea. GCHQ appears not to have been able to find a way to use the idea, and in any case, treated it as [[classified information]], so that when it was reinvented and published by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in 1977, Cocks' prior achievement remained unknown until 1997. In 2001, Cocks developed one of the first secure [[ID-based cryptography|identity based encryption]] (IBE) schemes, based on assumptions about [[quadratic residues]] in composite groups. The [[Cocks IBE scheme]] is not widely used in practice due to its high degree of [[ciphertext expansion]]. However, it is currently one of the few IBE schemes which do not use [[pairing|bilinear pairings]], and rely for security on more well-studied mathematical problems. As of 2003, Clifford Cocks held the post of Chief Mathematician at GCHQ.

The Climate Data Analysis Tool (CDAT) is a software used in atmospheric sciences and climatology to display meteorological fields such as pressure, temperature, or wind speeds. It allows to read gridded meteorological data in different formats such as netCDF or GRIB and plot time series of displays from several identical datasets with differing times. It is similar in scope to [[Grid Analysis and Display System]] but with more extensive user interface and capabilities. ==External links== *http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/software-portal/cdat [[Category:Earth sciences graphics software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6478</id> <title>Climbing formwork</title> <text>[[Image:Takapuna Sentinel Building Construction.jpg|right|thumb|Climbing formwork on a future residential [[skyscraper]] in [[Takapuna]], New Zealand - the whole white upperstructure is actually formwork and associated working facilities.]] '''Climbing formwork''' is a special type of [[formwork]] for vertical [[concrete]] structures that rises with the building process. While relatively complicated and costly, it can be an effective solution for buildings that are either very repetitive in form (such as towers or skyscrapers) or that require a seamless wall structure (using '''gliding formwork''', a special type of climbing formwork). Various types of climbing formwork exist, which are either relocated from time to time, or can even move on their own (usually on hydraulic jacks, required for self-climbing and gliding formworks). == Process == Best known in the construction of [[tower]]s, [[skyscraper]]s and other tall vertical structures, it allows the reuse of the same formwork over and over for identical (or very similar) sections / [[Storey|stories]] further up the structure. It can also enable very large concrete structures to be constructed in one single pour (which may take days or weeks as the formwork rises with the process), thus creating seamless structures with enhanced strength and visual appearance, as well as reducing construction times and material costs (at the joints which would otherwise require extra reinforcement / connectors).<ref name="ART">''[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NSX/is_7_48/ai_106389510 Chicago high-rise with self-climbing formwork]'' - ''Concrete Construction'', July 2003, via 'findarticles.com'. Accessed 2008-06-16.</ref> The climbing formwork structure normally does not only contain the formwork itself, but also usually provides working space / [[scaffold]]s for construction crews. It may also provide areas for machinery and screens for weather protection, up to being fully enclosed while yet staying modular around a changing building structure.<ref name="CN"/><ref>[http://www.hunnebeck.no/pages/3629/news/detail/201 New „Tour Granite“ building in the Paris financial district] (from a [[Hünnebeck]] press release.

This may entail lifting the whole section, or be achieved segmentally. *'''Climbing formwork (self-climbing)''' - In this type of formwork, the structure elevates itself with the help of mechanic leverage equipment (usually [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]]). To do this, it is usually fixed to sacrificial cones or rails emplaced in the previously cast concrete.<ref name="CN">''Building towers over Auckland's North Shore'' - ''NZ Construction News'', Volume 2, Issue 3, July 2007</ref><ref name="AZO">''[http://www.azobuild.com/details.asp?ArticleID=2967 Beetham Tower, Liverpool - innovation in climbing formwork]'' (abstract from the AZoBuild.com building and construction knowledge base website.

However, the climbing process is continuous instead of intermittent, and is usually only interrupted for a very short time (for example to fix the mounting mechanisms to new anchoring points). The advantage is that it will produce seamless structures, but it requires a continuous, uninterrupted process throughout, with serious potential quality and stability problems if the pour has
