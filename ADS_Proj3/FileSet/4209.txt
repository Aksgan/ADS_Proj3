In Red Hat Enterprise Linux this is typically done by using kickstart scripts, there are specific products to create and manage an SOE like [[Red Hat Network|Red Hat Satellite Server]] which avoid the disk space usage and maintenance difficulties of managing disk images. ==References== # [http://soe.ecu.edu.au/about/ www.soe.ecu.edu.au] # [http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/Our%20Organisation%2FUniversity%20services%2FInformation%20Technology%20Services%2FInformation%20and%20Services%2FResources%2FStandard%20Operating%20Environment www.rmit.edu.au] ==External links== * [http://unattended.msfn.org/ MFSN's Unattended Windows Installation Guide] [[Category:System administration]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35542</id> <title>Standard illuminant</title> <text>[[Image:CIE illuminants A,B,C.svg|thumb|300px|Relative [[spectral power distribution]]s (SPDs) of CIE illuminants A, B, and C from 380nm to 780nm.]] A '''standard illuminant''' is a theoretical source of [[visible light]] with a profile (its [[spectral power distribution]]) which is published. Standard illuminants provide a basis for comparing images or colors recorded under different lighting. ==CIE illuminants== The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (usually abbreviated '''CIE''' for its French name) is the body responsible for publishing all of the well-known standard illuminants. Each of these is known by a letter or by a letter-number combination. Illuminants A, B, and C were introduced in 1931, with the intention of respectively representing average incandescent light, direct sunlight, and average daylight. Illuminants D represent phases of daylight, Illuminant E is the equal-energy illuminant, while Illuminants F represent fluorescent lamps of various composition. There are instructions on how to experimentally produce light sources ("standard sources") corresponding to the older illuminants. For the relatively newer ones (such as series D), experimenters are left to measure to profiles of their sources and compare them to the published spectra:<ref name=schanda/> {{quote|At present no artificial source is recommended to realize CIE standard illuminant D65 or any other illuminant D of different CCT. It is hoped that new developments in light sources and filters will eventually offer sufficient basis for a CIE recommendation.|CIE|Technical Report (2004) Colorimetry, 3rd ed., Publication 15:2004, CIE Central Bureau, Vienna}} Nevertheless, they do provide a measure, called the [[Metamerism Index]], to assess the quality of daylight simulators.<ref>{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=1999|isbn=92 9034 051 7|title=A Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators for Colorimetry|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/51-2-99.html|series=51.2-1999 (including Supplement 1-1999)|quote=A method is provided for evaluating the suitability of a test source as a simulator of CIE Standard Illuminants D55, D65, or D75. The Supplement, prepared in 1999, adds the CIE Illuminant D50 to the line of illuminants where the method can be applied to. For each of these standard illuminants, spectral radiance factor data are supplied for five pairs of nonfluorescent samples that are metameric matches. The colorimetric differences of the five pairs are computed for the test illuminant; the average of these differences is taken as the visible range metamerism index and is used as a measure of the quality of the test illuminant as a simulator for nonfluorescent samples. For fluorescent samples, the quality is further assessed in terms of an ultraviolet range metamerism index, defined as the average of the colorimetric differences computed with the test illuminant for three further pairs of samples, each pair consisting of a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent sample which are metameric under the standard illuminant.|publisher=Bureau central de la CIE|location=Paris}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=CIE Standard|title=Standard Method of Assessing the Spectral Quality of Daylight Simulators for Visual Appraisal and Measurement of Colour|series=S012/E:2004|year=2004|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s012.html}} Prepared by TC 1-53 "A Standard Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators".

In 1968, the estimate of c<sub>2</sub> was revised from 0.01438 m·K to 0.014388 m·K (and before that, it was 0.01435 m·K when illuminant A was standardized). This difference shifted the [[Planckian locus]], changing the color temperature of the illuminant from its nominal 2848 K to 2856 K: <math>T_{new}=T_{old} \times \frac{1.4388}{1.435} = 2848\ \text{K} \times 1.002648 = 2855.54\ \text{K}</math> In order to avoid further possible changes in the color temperature, the CIE now specifies the SPD directly, based on the original (1931) value of c<sub>2</sub>:<ref name=schanda/> <math>S_{A}(\lambda)=100 \left(\frac{560}{\lambda}\right)^5 \frac{\exp \frac{1.435 \times 10^7}{2848 \times 560}-1}{\exp\frac{1.435 \times 10^7}{2848 \lambda}-1}</math> The coefficients have been selected to achieve a peak SPD of 100 at 560 nm.

They are derived from Illuminant A by using a liquid filters. B served as a representative of noon sunlight, with a [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT) of 4874 K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774 K.
