the part of an [[integrated circuit]] in which a single [[bit]] is recorded. The smaller the bit cells are, the better the [[memory storage density|storage density]] of the medium is. In [[magnetic storage]], the [[magnetic flux]] or [[magnetization]] doesn't necessarily change at the boundaries of bit cells to indicate bit states. For example, the presence of a magnetic transition within a bit cell might record state 1, and the lack of such a transition might record state 0. Other [[code|encoding]]s are also possible. == See also == *[[Computer data storage]] == References == * [http://www.softpres.org/?id=glossary:bit_cell Software Preservation Society glossary entry for bit cell] * [http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/storage/pm/pm1.html Hitachi research page on patterned magnetic media] [[Category:Computer storage]] {{compu-storage-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>4018</id> <title>Bitstream</title> <text>{{dablink|For other uses of this term, see [[Bitstream (disambiguation)]].}} {{unreferenced|date=June 2007}} A '''bitstream''' or '''bit stream''' is a [[time series]] of [[bit]]s. A [[bytestream]] is a series of [[byte]]s, typically of 8 bits each, and can be regarded as a special case of a bitstream. Bitstreams are used extensively in [[telecommunications]] and [[computing]]: for example, the [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]] communications technology transports synchronous bitstreams, and the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[communications protocol]] transports a bytestream without synchronous timing. When a bitstream is captured and stored in a [[computer storage]] medium, a [[computer file]] is created. The term '''bitstream''' is frequently used to describe the configuration data to be loaded into a [[field programmable gate array]] (FPGA). This usage may have originated based on the common method of configuring the FPGA from a serial bit stream, typically from a serial [[programmable read-only memory|PROM]] or [[flash memory]] chip, although most FPGAs also support a byte-parallel loading method as well. The detailed format of the bitstream for a particular FPGA chip is usually considered proprietary to the FPGA vendor. In mathematics, several specific [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequences]] of bits have been studied for their mathematical properties; these include the [[Baum–Sweet sequence]], [[Ehrenfeucht–Mycielski sequence]], [[Fibonacci word]], [[Kolakoski sequence]], [[regular paperfolding sequence]], [[Rudin–Shapiro sequence]], and [[Thue–Morse sequence]]. ==See also== * [[Elementary stream|MPEG Elementary stream]] * [[Bitstream format]] * [[Bit stream access]] [[Category:Binary sequences| ]] [[Category:Data transmission]] [[Category:Reconfigurable computing]] [[de:Bitstream]] [[ko:비트스트림]] [[hu:Bitstream]] [[pt:Fluxo de bits]] [[ru:Битовый поток]] [[th:กระแสข้อมูลบิต]] [[zh:位元流]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4030</id> <title>BlackBerry Messenger</title> <text>{{redirect|BBM|the band|Bruce-Baker-Moore|the [[Canada|Canadian]] television and radio [[Audience measurement|ratings]] company|BBM Canada|the group of [[CBS]] radio and television stations in Chicago|WBBM}} {{Infobox Software | name = BlackBerry Messenger | developer = Research In Motion Limited | frequently_updated = no | operating system = [[BlackBerry OS]] | language = multilingual | genre = Instant Messaging Client | website = [http://www.blackberry.com/bbm Blackberry Messenger] | latest release version = 5.0.1.41 | latest release date = {{start date and age|2010|10|20}} <ref>[http://crackberry.com/blackberry-messenger-5-0-1-41-now-available-download BlackBerry Messenger 5.0.1.41 Now Available For Download], Retrieved October 21, 2010</ref> }} '''BlackBerry Messenger''' (BBM) is a proprietary [[Instant Messenger]] application included on [[BlackBerry]] devices. It was developed by [[Research In Motion]] (RIM), maker of the BlackBerry device. Messages sent via Blackberry Messenger are sent over the [[Blackberry_PIN#BlackBerry_PIN|BlackBerry PIN]] system; thus, communication is only possible between two BlackBerry devices. Exchanging messages is also possible via dedicated discussion or chat groups, which allow multiple BlackBerry devices to communicate in a single session. In addition to offering text-based instant messages, BlackBerry Messenger also allows users to send pictures, voicenotes (audio recordings), files, location on a map, and a wide selection of [[emoticons]] (also known as "smileys") over the Blackberry network. Blackberry messenger allows you easy access to keeping in touch with friends by instant messaging, and you can create a profile that can be updated as much as you want sort of like a social network on your mobile phone. With the release of BlackBerry Messenger 5.0, BlackBerry allows users to use a [[QR Code]] barcode to add each other to their respective friends lists rather than using only numeric PIN identification or an email address associated with the user's BlackBerry. ==Features== * Send and receive messages with unlimited length. * Choose a personal BBM display picture and status. * Real-time confirmations when messages are delivered and read. * Share photos, videos and more with multiple contacts at once. * Add contacts by scanning barcodes or sharing PINs. * Reveal the music that’s playing on your smartphone. *Send music files to your friends ==References== <references/> == Further reading == * {{cite web|ref=harv|title=How BlackBerry Messenger Works|first=Diane|last=Dannenfeldt|url=http://communication.howstuffworks.com./blackberry-messenger.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|year=2008|date=2008-02-21}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Blackberry Messenger}} [[Category:Instant messaging]] [[Category:Research In Motion]] [[Category:BlackBerry software]] {{web-software-stub}} [[fr:BlackBerry Messenger]] [[id:BlackBerry Messenger]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4034</id> <title>BlackBox Component Builder</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|wikify =November 2010|unreferenced =May 2008|notability =July 2008}} '''BlackBox Component Builder''' is an integrated development environment optimized for component-based software development. It consists of development tools, a library of reusable components, a framework that simplifies the development of robust custom components and applications, and a run-time environment for components. In BlackBox, the development of applications and their components is done in [[Component Pascal]]. This language is a descendant of Pascal, Modula-2, and Oberon. It provides modern features such as objects, full type safety, components (in the form of modules), dynamic linking of components, and garbage collection. The entire BlackBox Component Builder is written in Component Pascal: all library components, all development tools including the Component Pascal compiler, and even the low-level run-time system with its garbage collector. == External links == *[http://www.oberon.ch/BlackBox.html Official site] *[http://userserv.reutlingen-university.de/~hug/buch/cf.htm An introductory text using BlackBox: Stan Warford - Computing Fundamentals] *[http://www.zinnamturm.eu/ Tools and Utilities for BlackBox] {{DEFAULTSORT:Blackbox Component Builder}} [[Category:Integrated development environments]] {{programming-software-stub}} [[de:BlackBox Component Builder]] [[ru:BlackBox Component Builder]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4045</id> <title>Black Perl</title> <text>'''Black Perl''' is a famous piece of [[Perl#Poetry|Perl poetry]].
