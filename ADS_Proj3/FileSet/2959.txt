And from the view of different procedures, the testing comprises R&D Testing, Factory Testing and Certificate Testing. {{Portal|Software Testing}} ==R&D Testing== R&D test is the main test phase for mobile device, and it happens during the developing phase of the mobile devices. It contains '''[[hardware testing]], [[software testing]],''' and''' [[mechanical testing]].''' ==Factory Testing== Factory Testing is a kind of sanity check on mobile devices. It's conducted automatically to verify that there are no defects brought by the manufacturing or assembling. Mobile Testing contains Mobile application testing Hardware testing Battery(Charging) Testing Signal receiving Network Testing Protocol testing mobile games Testing Mobile software compatibility Testing. ==Certification Testing== Certification Testing is the check before a [[mobile device]] goes to market. Many [[institute]]s or [[government]]s require mobile devices to [[conform]] with their stated [[specification]]s and [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s to make sure the mobile device will not [[injury|harm]] [[user (computing)|user]]s' [[health]] and are compatible with devices from other [[manufacturer]]s. Once the mobile device passes all checks, a [[wikt:certificate|certification]] will be issued for it. ==Certification Forums== [[PTCRB]], [[Global_Certification_Forum|GCF]] {{Mobile phones}} [[Category:Software testing]] [[Category:Skills]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24800</id> <title>Mobile business intelligence</title> <text>{{For|a general overview|Business intelligence}} '''Mobile Business Intelligence''' (Mobile BI or Mobile Intelligence) refers to the distribution of business data to [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s. [[Business intelligence]] (BI) refers to computer-based techniques used in spotting, digging-out, and analyzing business data, such as sales revenue by products and/or departments or associated costs and incomes.<ref>[http://www.businessdictionary.com/ BusinessDictionary.com]</ref> Although the concept of mobile computing has been prevalent for over a decade, Mobile BI has shown a momentum/growth only very recently. This change has been partly encouraged by a change from the ‘wired world’ to a wireless world with the advantage of [[smartphones]] which has led to a new era of mobile computing, especially in the field of BI.<ref>[http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2008_89/10001705-1.html?pg=1Mobile Business Intelligence for Intelligent Businesses]</ref> According to the Aberdeen Group, a large number of companies are rapidly undertaking mobile BI owing to a large number of market pressures such as the need for higher efficiency in business processes, improvement in employee productivity (e.g., time spent looking for information), better and faster decision making, better customer service, and delivery of real-time bi-directional data access to make decisions anytime and anywhere.<ref>[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/enterprise_applications/development/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=VCS3TZ0FEKCO5QE1GHRSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=212300110 Mobile Business Intelligence: Best-in-Class Secrets to Success]</ref> ==History== === Information delivery to mobile devices === The predominant method for accessing BI information is using proprietary software or a [[Web]] browser on a personal computer to connect to BI applications. These BI applications request data from databases. Starting in the late 1990s, BI systems offered alternatives for receiving [[data]], including email and mobile devices.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ===Static data push=== Initially, mobile devices such as pagers and mobile phones received pushed data using a short message service ([[SMS]]) or text messages. These applications were designed for specific mobile devices, contained minimal amounts of information, and provided no data interactivity. As a result, the early mobile BI applications were expensive to design and maintain while providing limited informational value, and garnered little interest.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ===Data access via a mobile browser=== The [[mobile browser]] on a [[smartphone]], a handheld computer integrated with a mobile phone,<ref>[http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Smartphone&i=51537,00.asp Smartphone definition]</ref> provided a means to read simple tables of data. The small screen space, immature mobile browsers, and slow data transmission could not provide a satisfactory BI experience.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ===Mobile client application=== In 2002, [[Research in Motion]] released the first [[BlackBerry]] smartphone optimized for wireless email use. [[Wireless email]] proved to be the “killer app” that accelerated the popularity of the smartphone market. By the mid-2000s, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry had solidified its hold on the smartphone market with both corporate and governmental organizations. The BlackBerry smartphones eliminated the obstacles to mobile business intelligence. The BlackBerry offered a consistent treatment of data across its many models, provided a much larger screen for viewing data, and allowed user interactivity via the thumbwheel and keyboard. BI vendors re-entered the market with offerings spanning different mobile operating systems (BlackBerry, [[Windows]], [[Symbian]]) and data access methods. The two most popular data access options were: * to use the mobile browser to access data, similar to desktop computer, and * to create a native application for the mobile device. The native application on the mobile device proved more successful as it offered superior interactivity designed specifically for the device screen.<ref>[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/business_intelligence/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=QJ2ILLXEXQ0SDQE1GHOSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=207801077&cid=RSSfeed_IE_News Intelligence on the Go: Mobile Delivery of BI]</ref> ===Purpose-built Mobile BI apps=== Apple quickly set the standard for mobile devices with the introduction of the [[iPhone]]. In the first three years, Apple sold over 33.75 million units.<ref>[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/04/22results.html Apple Reports Second Quarter Results]</ref> Similarly in 2010, Apple sold over 1 million iPads in just under three months.<ref>[http://www.cnbc.com/id/36911690 Apple Sells 1 Million iPads]</ref> Both devices feature an interactive touchscreen display that is the de facto standard on many mobile phones and tablet computers. In 2008, Apple published the [[Software development kit|SDK]] for which developers can build applications that run natively on the iPhone and iPad instead of Safari based-applications. These native applications can give the user a robust, easier-to-read and easier-to-navigate experience. The Apple App Store now has over 250,000 apps, giving the Apple mobile devices a decided advantage. Others were quick to replicate Apple’s success. The [[Android Market]] now has over 80,000 apps available for the mobile devices running the Android operating system. More importantly, the advent of the Apple iPhone has radically changed the way people use data on their mobile devices. This includes mobile BI. Business intelligence applications can be used to transform reports and data into mobile dashboards, and have them instantly delivered to any iPhone or iPad.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/systems_management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224400267 |title=Mobile BI
