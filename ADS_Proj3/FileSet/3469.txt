cover in which there is an edge from vertex ''i'' to vertex <math>\sigma(i)</math> for each ''i''. If the weight of a cycle-cover is defined to be the product of the weights of the edges in each cycle, then : <math> \operatorname{Weight}(\sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}.</math> The permanent of an <math>n \times n</math> matrix ''A'' is defined as :<math> \operatorname{perm}(A)=\sum_\sigma \prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i,\sigma(i)}</math> where <math>\sigma</math> is a permutation over <math>\{1,2,\dots,n\}</math>. Thus the permanent of ''A'' is equal to the sum of the weights of all cycle-covers of the graph. ===Perfect matchings=== A square matrix <math>A = (a_{ij})</math> can also be viewed as the [[biadjacency matrix]] of a [[bipartite graph]] which has [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] <math>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</math> on one side and <math>y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n</math> on the other side, with <math>a_{ij}</math> representing the weight of the edge from vertex <math>x_i</math> to vertex <math>y_j</math>. If the weight of a perfect matching <math>\sigma</math> that matches <math>x_i</math> to <math>y_{\sigma(i)}</math> is defined to be the product of the weights of the edges in the matching, then :<math> \operatorname{Weight}(\sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}.</math> Thus the permanent of ''A'' is equal to the sum of the weights of all perfect matchings of the graph. === 0-1 permanents: counting in unweighted graphs === In an unweighted, directed, simple graph, if we set each <math>a_{ij}</math> to be 1 if there is an edge from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'', then each nonzero cycle cover has weight 1, and the adjacency matrix has 0-1 entries. Thus the permanent of a 01-matrix is equal to the ''number'' of cycle-covers of an unweighted directed graph. For an unweighted bipartite graph, if we set ''a''<sub>''i,j''</sub> = 1 if there is an [[graph theory|edge]] between the vertices <math>x_i</math> and <math>y_j</math> and ''a''<sub>''i,j''</sub> = 0 otherwise, then each perfect matching has weight 1. Thus the number of perfect matchings in ''G'' is equal to the permanent of matrix ''A''.<ref name="Kozen">Dexter Kozen.

ISBN 9780387976877; pp. 141&ndash;142</ref> == Minimal permanent == For a doubly-stochastic matrix, the matrix <math>a_{ij} =\frac{1}{n}</math>, that is the uniform matrix, has strictly the smallest permanent. This was originally conjectured by [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van Der Waeden]], and recently proved [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/PermanentConjecture.html]. == Computation == {{main|Computation of the permanent of a matrix|Permanent is sharp-P-complete}} The permanent is believed to be more difficult to compute than the determinant. While the determinant can be computed in [[polynomial time]] by [[Gaussian elimination]], Gaussian elimination cannot be used to compute the permanent. Moreover, computing the permanent of a 0-1 matrix (matrix whose entries are 0 or 1) is [[sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]]. Thus, if the permanent can be computed in [[polynomial time]] by any method, then '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]] = [[sharp-P|#P]]''' which is an even stronger statement than [[P = NP problem|P = NP]]. When the entries of ''A'' are nonnegative, however, the permanent can be computed [[approximation algorithm|approximately]] in [[randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] polynomial time, up to an error of ε''M'', where ''M'' is the value of the permanent and ε > 0 is arbitrary.<ref>{{Citation |last1= Jerrum | first1= M. |author1-link= Mark Jerrum |last2=Sinclair | first2= A. |author2-link= Alistair Sinclair |last3=Vigoda | first3= E. |title=[http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1008731.1008738 A polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the permanent of a matrix with nonnegative entries] |journal= Journal of the ACM |year=2004 |volume= 51|pages= 671–697 |doi= 10.1145/1008731.1008738 }}</ref> ==See also== *[[Determinant]] *[[Bapat–Beg theorem]], an application of permanent in [[order statistics]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Permanent.html Permanent at PlanetMath] [[Category:Algebra]] [[Category:Linear algebra]] [[Category:Matrix theory]] [[Category:Permutations]] [[de:Permanente]] [[fr:Permanent (mathématiques)]] [[ko:퍼머넌트]] [[it:Permanente (matematica)]] [[he:פרמננטה]] [[pl:Permanent]] [[ru:Перманент]] [[zh:积和式]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28866</id> <title>Permissive free software licence</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=August 2008}} A '''permissive free software licence''' is a [[free software license]] that applies to an otherwise [[copyright]]ed work. It also offers many of the same rights found in free software licenses when releasing a work to the public. In contrast to non-permissive [[copyleft]] (reciprocal) licenses such as the [[GNU General Public License]], any copies and derivatives of the source code created under permissive licenses '''may''' be made available on terms that are '''more''' restrictive than those of the original license. For example, source code released under a permissive software license does not have the requirement that all distributed derivatives also be made available to the public. Well-known examples of permissive licenses include the [[MIT License]] and the [[BSD licenses]]. ==Comparison to public domain== [[Computer Associates Int'l v. Altai]] used the term "public domain" to refer to works that have become widely shared and distributed under permission, rather than work that was deliberately put into the public domain. However, such licenses are not actually equivalent to releasing a work into the [[public domain#Copyright|public domain]]. Permissive licenses often do stipulate some limited requirements, such as that the original authors must be credited (''attribution''). If a work is truly in the public domain, this is usually not legally required, but a United States copyright registration requires disclosing material that has been previously published,<ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/forms/notice.html US Copyright Office Form CO]; see also ''[[dBase#dBase programming language|Ashton-Tate v. Fox]]''</ref> and attribution may still be considered an ethical requirement in academia. ==GPL compatibility== Some permissive free software licenses contain clauses that require advertising materials to credit the copyright holder. Licenses with an advertising clause include the [[BSD license#UC Berkeley advertising clause|4-clause BSD license]], the [[PHP License]], and the [[OpenSSL license#License incompatibilities|OpenSSL License]]. These licenses, although they are permissive free software licenses, are incompatible with the widely used [[GNU General Public License]]. Examples of permissive free software licenses ''without'' advertising clauses are the [[MIT License]], the 3-clause [[BSD license]], the [[Zlib License]], and all versions of the [[Apache License]] except 1.0. Some licenses do not allow derived works to add a restriction that says a redistributor cannot add more restrictions. The purpose of such clauses is to disallow redistribution using the GPL or similar copyleft licenses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} There are many examples such as the [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]] and [[Microsoft Public License|MPL]]. However such restrictions also make the license incompatible with the BSD license. == See also == {{Wikibooks|FOSS Licensing}} {{Portal|Free software}} *[[Free software licence]] *[[Comparison of
