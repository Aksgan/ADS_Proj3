of [[Automatic Data Processing|ADP]]) created a product named KCML. Both products support [[DOS]], [[Windows]] and various [[Unix]] systems. The Basic2 language has been substantially enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs. Compared to the 2200 Wang hardware the compiled solutions improve all factors (speed, disk space, memory, user limits) by tens to hundreds of times. So while Wang support for the 2200 is gone many software applications continue to function. During the 1970s about 2,000 Wang 2200T computers were shipped to the [[USSR]]. In the 1980s due to the [[Afgan war]] US and [[COCOM]] export restrictions ended the shipment of Wang computers. The Soviets were in great need of computers. In 1981 Russian engineers at [[Minpribor]]'s [[Schetmash]] factory in [[Kursk]] [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] the Wang 2200T and created a computer they named the [[Iskra 226]]. It used the same Basic language (named T-Basic) with a few enhancements.<ref>Iskra 226 http://www.wang2200.org/iskra-226.html</ref> Many research papers reference calculations done on the Iskra 226. The computer won a 1985 state prize.<ref>Advances in Computers - Volume 55 - Page 296 - Iskra 226 Russian Clone of 2200 http://books.google.com/books?id=fa4DAAAACAAJ&dq=Advances+in+Computers</ref> === Wang OIS === The Wang OIS (Office Information System) was heavily WP oriented and featured Wang's "Glossary" language, a system of programming that fitted into the WP model and was designed to be simple to master. The design goal was that secretaries would be able to use Glossary to extend the functionality of the document management and manipulation provided by the OIS.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Like the Wang 2200, the OIS was characterized by evolution into a 24-user system. The OIS and the VS overlapped. Features such a dual-coax connections to workstations and printers were common to both system families. Buried deep in the VS [[microcode]] are entire pieces of OIS code, probably because WP did not figure into the original design of the VS, but was added later.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Wang also had a line called Alliance, which was based on the high end OIS (140/145) hardware architecture. It had more powerful software compared to the OIS word processing and list processing packages. The system was Tempest certified, leading to global deployment in American embassies after the Iran hostage crisis.<ref>Broad, William J. "Computer 'whispers' worry Washington" The Globe and Mail. Toronto, Ont.:Apr 9, 1983. p. P.10</ref> The most significant enhancement{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} was in the indexing capabilities of the Alliance system; documents could be indexed by every word contained in them. The database product, Visual Memory, permitted every word in each field to be indexed. In addition to the advanced indexing features, the Alliance word processor was also substantially enhanced,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} even though the Z80 platform on which it ran forced it to remain as an 8-bit application in a 64KB workstation. ===The Wang VS computer line=== The first Wang VS computer<ref>Referring to the VS, Wang appears to have used the terms "computer," "minicomputer," "super minicomputer," and "multiprocessor computer," but not "mainframe."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}</ref> was introduced in 1977, about the same time as [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]], and continues to be in use 31 years later. Its [[instruction set]] was compatible with the [[IBM 360]] series, but it did not run any IBM 360 system software. The VS operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations. The VS was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general, and IBM in particular. While many programming languages were available, the VS was typically programmed in [[COBOL]]. Other languages supported in the VS [[integrated development environment]] included [[Assembly language|Assembler]], COBOL 74, COBOL 85, BASIC, [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[RPG II]], C, [[PL/I]], [[FORTRAN]], Glossary, MABASIC and Procedure (a scripting language). [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] was also supported for I/O co-processor development. The Wang PACE (Professional Application Creation Environment) [[4GL]] and database was used from the mid-1980s onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens, hundreds of distinct application modules, and serving many hundreds of users. Substantial [[vertical application]]s were developed for the Wang VS by third party software houses throughout the 1980s in COBOL, PACE, BASIC, PL/I and RPG II. The [[Wang OFFICE]] family of applications and Wang WP were both popular applications on the VS. Word Processing ran on the VS through services that emulated the OIS environment and downloaded the WP software as "microcode" (in Wang terminology) to VS workstations. The press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by Wang, including the VS, as "minicomputers,"<ref>Berg, Eric N. (1985), "Fast Prime Computer to Make Debut," ''The New York Times,'' January 22, 1985, d1: "The Prime model should also face stiff competition from other new high-speed minicomputers, such as the Data General Corporation's MV 10000, Wang Laboratories Inc.'s VS 300, and the International Business Machines Corporation's 4381 Model 3"</ref><ref>Stein, Charles (1986): "A High-Tech David Faltered as Goliath," ''The Boston Globe,'' November 27, 1989, Business section, p. 1: "the VS-300, a top of the line minicomputer Wang brought out in 1985..."</ref><ref>Rosenberg, Robert (1992): "Company Fumbles Its Alliance with Giant IBM," ''The Boston Globe,'' July 28, 1992, Business section, p. 37: "a steep decline in sales of its VS minicomputer and the recession generally, has pushed the Lowell computer maker to the brink"</ref> and Kenney's 1992 book refers to the VS line as "minicomputers" throughout.<ref>{{cite book | first = Charles C. | last = Kenney | title = Riding the Runaway Horse: The Rise and Decline of Wang Laboratories | publisher=Little, Brown and Company | date= 1992 | isbn = 0-316-48919-0}}: index entry p. 320, pp 97â€“9, and elsewhere</ref> Although some argue that the high-end VSes and their successors should qualify as mainframes, Dr. Wang avoided this term. In his autobiography, Dr. Wang, rather than calling the VS 300 a mainframe, said that it "verges on mainframe performance.".<ref>{{cite book | first = An | last = Wang | title = Lessons: An Autobiography |coauthors = with Eugene Linden | year = 1986
