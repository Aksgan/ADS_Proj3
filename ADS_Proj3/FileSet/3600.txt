[[holism|holistic]] approaches to expanding consciousness. Copyrighted and published in 1983, ''Prometheus Rising'' began as Wilson's [[Ph.D.]] dissertation called "The Evolution of Neuro-Sociological Circuits: A Contribution to the Sociobiology of Consciousness" in 1978-79 for [[Paideia University]]. In 1982, while in [[Ireland]], Wilson rewrote the manuscript for commercial publication, removing [[footnotes]], bolding up the style, adding chapters and exercises, and sketching out diagrams for the illustrations. Eventually Wilson submitted the work to [[New Falcon Publications]], which accepted it within 48 hours. Wilson received his advance 48 hours after that, according to his preface in the tenth printing of ''Prometheus Rising''. The current edition also includes an introduction by [[Israel Regardie]].

Often proofs of impossibility have put to rest decades or centuries of work attempting to find a solution. Proofs of impossibility are usually expressible as universal propositions in logic (see [[universal quantification]]). One of the oldest and most famous proofs of impossibility was the 1882 proof of [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] showing that the ancient problem of [[squaring the circle]] cannot be solved, because the number [[Pi|π]] is [[Transcendental number|transcendental]] and only [[algebraic numbers]] can be constructed by compass and straightedge. Another classical problem was that of creating a general formula using radicals expressing the solution of a polynomial equation of degree 5 or higher. [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] showed this impossible using concepts such as [[solvable group]]s from [[Galois theory]], a new subfield of [[abstract algebra]] that he conceived. Among the most important proofs of impossibility of the 20th century were those related to [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], which showed that there are problems that cannot be solved in general by any algorithm at all. The most famous is the [[halting problem]]. In [[computational complexity theory]], techniques like relativization (see [[oracle machine]]) provide "weak" proofs of impossibility excluding certain proof techniques. Other techniques like proofs of completeness for a [[complexity class]] provide evidence for the difficulty of problems by showing them to be just as hard to solve as other known problems that have proven intractable. == The existence of irrational numbers: Pythagoras proof == Although not usually considered an "impossibility proof", the proof by [[Pythagoras]] or his students that the square-root of 2 cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers (counting numbers) has had a profound effect on mathematics: it bifurcated "the numbers" into two non-overlapping collections—the [[rational numbers]] and the [[irrational numbers]]. This bifurcation was used by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] in his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal method]], which in turn was used by Turing in his proof that the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (the [[decision problem]] of [[Hilbert]]) is undecidable. ca 500 B.C. "It is unknown when, or by whom, the 'theorem of Pythagoras' was discovered. 'The discovery', says Heath, 'can hardly have been made by Pythagoras himself, but it was certainly made in his school.' Pythagoras lived about 570-490. Democritus, born about 470, wrote 'on irrational lines and solids'... Proofs followed for various square roots of the primes up to 17. "There is a famous passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' in which it is stated that Teodorus (Plato's teacher) proved the irrationality of :<math>\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, ...,</math> 'taking all the separate cases up to the root of 17 square feet..." (Hardy and Wright, p. 42). A more general proof now exists that: :The ''m''th root of an integer ''N'' is irrational, unless ''N'' is the ''m''th power of an integer ''n''" (Hardy and Wright, p. 40). == The existence of transcendental numbers == There exists at least one number for which it is impossible to find any ''algebraic equation'' that this number satisfies (i.e. you plug the number into the equation wherever X occurs and the equation equals zero). Stated another way: There exists at least one number which does not satisfy any equations of the form called an ''algebraic equation'': :<math>a_0 X^n + a_1 X^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n = 0</math> where <math>a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n</math> are integers, not all zero. Numbers that do not satisfy any equation of this form are called [[transcendental numbers]]. "It is not immediately obvious that there are any transcendental numbers, though actually, as we shall see in a moment, almost all real numbers are transcendental" (Hardy and Wright, p. 160) Hardy and Wright (p. 160) offer theorems to show that: #The aggregate of algebraic numbers is enumerable. #[[almost everywhere|Almost all]] real numbers are transcendental. #A real algebraic number of degree n is not approximable to any order greater than n (Liouville's theorem) This last theorem "enables us to produce as many examples of transcendental numbers as we please" (Hardy and Wright p. 161). Hardy and Wright go on to prove that pi and the "exponential" ''e'' are transcendental. [[Hermite]] offered the first proof that ''e'' is transcendental (cf Notes in Hardy and Wright p. 177). In a footnote p. 190 Hardy and Wright discuss the diagonal method of Cantor that demonstrates the existence of transcendental numbers. === Three impossible constructions === Three famous questions of [[compass and straightedge constructions|Greek geometry]] were: # "...with compass and straight-edge to [[trisect any angle]], # to construct a cube with a volume [[Doubling the cube|twice the volume of a given cube]], ''and'' # to construct a square [[squaring the circle|equal in area]] to that of a given circle. For more than 2,000 years unsuccessful attempts were made to solve these problems; at last, in the nineteenth century it was proved that the desired constructions are logically impossible" (Nagel and Newman p. 8). [[Squaring the circle]] requires [[transcendental number]]s, unattainable by [[compass and straightedge]]. Both [[doubling the cube]] and [[trisecting the angle]] require third roots, which are not [[constructible numbers]] by compass and straightedge. "Pi is not a 'Euclidean' number ... and therefore it is impossible to construct, by Euclidean methods a length equal to the circumference
