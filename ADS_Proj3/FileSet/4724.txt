written the microcode for the Wang 700 (and its derivative, the Wang 500) rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching. The operator of a Wang 1200 typed text on a conventional IBM Selectric keyboard; when the Return key was pressed, the line of text was stored on a cassette tape. One cassette held roughly 20 pages of text, and could be "played back" (e.g., the text retrieved) by printing the contents on [[Continuous stationery|continuous-form paper]] in the 1200 typewriter's "print" mode. The stored text could also be edited, using keys on a simple, six-key array. Basic editing functions included Insert, Delete, Skip (character, line), and so on. The labor and cost savings of this device were immediate, and remarkable: pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors, and projects could be worked on, stored, and then retrieved for use later on. The rudimentary Wang 1200 machine was the precursor of the Wang Office Information System (OIS), which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the American workplace. ===Wang OIS=== Following the Wang 1200, Harold Koplow and David Moros made another attempt at designing a word processor. They started by first writing the user's manual for the product. A 2002 Boston Globe article refers to Koplow as a "wisecracking rebel" who "was waiting for dismissal when, in 1975, he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible." In Koplow's words, "Dr. Wang kicked me out of marketing. I, along with Dave Moros was relegated to Long Range Planning &mdash; 'LRPed'. This ... was tantamount to being fired: 'here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company.'" Although he and Moros were told to design a word processing machine, they were given no resources.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They perceived the assignment as busywork. They went ahead anyway, wrote the manual, and convinced Dr. Wang to turn it into a real project. The word processing machine &mdash; the Wang 1200 WPS &mdash; was introduced in June 1976 and was an instant success, as was its successor, the 1977 [[Wang OIS]] (Office Information System). These products were technological breakthroughs. They were multi-user systems. Each workstation looked like a typical [[computer terminal|terminal]], but contained its own [[Intel 8080]] microprocessor (later versions used a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]) and 64K of RAM (comparable, but lower, in power than the original IBM PC which came out in 1981). [[Disk storage]] was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations, and connection was via high-speed dual [[coaxial cable]] "928 Link".<ref>During the late 1970s and early 1980s Wang Labs Dept. 14, headed by Harold Koplow, was responsible for development of the WANG WPS and OIS Systems, Wang's most successful products. The internal code name for the project was "928" derived from the date of original conception of the product September 28, 1975.</ref> Multiple OIS masters could be networked to each other, allowing file sharing among hundreds of users. The systems were user-friendly and fairly easy to administer, with the latter task often performed by office personnel, in an era when most machines required trained administrators. All software for the systems was developed by Wang Laboratories, and the operating system, file formats, and electronic interface specification were closely held proprietary secrets. Wang did not want third parties developing for or interconnecting with its systems. (This was relaxed somewhat in the late eighties). ==Early computer models== === Wang 2200 === On its journey from calculators and word processing to serious [[data processing]] Wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer system, some of which were WP-based and some of which were DP-based. Instead of a clear, linear progression, the product lines overlapped and in some cases borrowed technology from each other. The most identifiable Wang [[minicomputer]] performing recognizable data processing was the [[Wang 2200]] which appeared in May, 1973. Unlike some other desktop computers such as the [[HP 9830]], it had a [[CRT]] in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled [[cassette tape]] storage unit and keyboard. [[Microcode]]d to run interpretive [[BASIC]], about 65,000 systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and medium-size businesses worldwide. The original 2200 was a single user system. The improved VP model increased performance by at over ten times and enhanced the language (renamed [[Basic-2]]). The 2200 VP evolved into a [[desktop computer]] and larger [[MVP]] system to support up to 16 workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The disk subsystems could be attached to up to 15 computers giving a theoretical upper limit of 240 workstations in a single [[cluster]]. Unlike the other product lines such as the VS and OIS (both described below), Wang aggressively used value added resellers (VARs) to customize and market 2200 systems. One such creative solution deployed dozens of 2200 systems and was developed in conjunction with [[Hawaii]]- and [[Hong Kong]]-based firm, [[Algorithms, Inc]]. It provided [[Pager|paging]] (beeper) services for much of the Hong Kong market in the early 1980s. Overshadowed by the Wang VS, the 2200 languished as a cost-effective, but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it. In the late 1980s Wang revisited the 2200 series one last time, offering 2200 customers a new 2200 CS with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging 2200s. The 2200 CS was accompanied by an Intel 386 processor, updated disk units and other peripherals. Most 2200 customers upgraded to the 2200 CS, after which Wang never again developed or marketed any new 2200 products. In 1997 Wang reported having about 200 2200 systems still under maintenance around the world. Throughout, Wang had always offered maintenance services for the 2200. The 2200 Basic2 language was ported to be compiled and run on non-Wang hardware and [[operating system]]s by at least two companies. [[Niakwa|Niakwa, Inc]] created a product named NPL (originally named Basic-2C). [[Kerridge Computer]] (now a part
