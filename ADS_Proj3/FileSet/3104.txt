at one center to monitor the status of signals operated from another center; * A transit system reporting schedule adherence exceptions to a transit customer information system and to a regional traveler information system, while also asking a traffic signal management system to instruct its signals to give priority to a behind-schedule transit vehicle; * An emergency management system reporting an incident to a freeway management system, to a traffic signal management system, to two transit management systems and to a traveler information system; * A freeway management system informing an emergency management system of a warning message just posted on a dynamic message sign on the freeway in response to its notification of an incident; and * A weather monitoring system (environmental sensors) informing a freeway management system of ice forming on the roadway so that the freeway management system is able to post warning messages on dynamic message signs as appropriate. NTCIP communications standards for center to center communications are listed below: (the corresponding NTCIP document number is shown in parentheses):<ref name="ntcip-guide">[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9001 The NTCIP Guide]</ref> * Data Exchange - DATEX-ASN [http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=2304 (NTCIP 2304)] * Web Services - XML [http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=2306 (NTCIP 2306)] The NTCIP has coordinated with other information level standards development organizations during development of the center-to-center application profiles and supports the: ITE Traffic Management Data Dictionary [http://www.ite.org/standards/tmdd/ (ITE TMDD)], IEEE 1512 Incident Management [http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc32/imwg/index.html (IEEE 1512)], APTA Transit Communications Interface Profiles [http://www.aptastandards.com/StandardsPrograms/ITStandardsProgram/TCIPProgram/tabid/113/Default.aspx (APTA TCIP)], and SAE J2354 Advanced Traveler Information Systems standards. ===NTCIP Standards Framework=== The NTCIP Framework is based primarily on the open standards of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), and [[ISO]], plus NTCIP data dictionary standards specific for the task of ITS device communications. A layered, or modular, approach to communications standards, is used to represent data communications between two computers or other electronic devices. NTCIP refers to “levels” in NTCIP, rather than “layers” to distinguish the hierarchical architecture applied from those defined by the Open System Interconnection Reference Model ([[OSI Model]]) of [[ISO]] and the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF). The five NTCIP levels are: information level, application level, transport level, subnetwork level, and plant level.<ref name="ntcip-guide">[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9001 The NTCIP Guide]</ref> The figure below (used with permission) shows how the NTCIP Information, Application, Transport, Subnetwork, and Plant Levels. [[Image:NTCIP_Framework.png|thumb|alt=NTCIP Framework. Reprinted from NTCIP 9001 v04 'The NTCIP Guide' by permission of NEMA.|NTCIP Framework.]] To ensure a working system, deployers should select and specify at least one NTCIP protocol or profile at each level. A discussion of each level, and NTCIP standards that apply at that level, follows:<ref name="ntcip-guide">[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9001 The NTCIP Guide]</ref> * '''NTCIP Information Level''' — Information standards define the meaning of data and messages and generally deal with ITS information (rather than information about the communications network). This is similar to defining a dictionary and phrase list within a language. These standards are above the traditional ISO seven-layer [[OSI model]]. Information level standards represent the functionality of the system to be implemented. * '''NTCIP Application Level''' — Application standards define the rules and procedures for exchanging information data. The rules may include definitions of proper grammar and syntax of a single statement, as well as the sequence of allowed statements. This is similar to combining words and phrases to form a sentence, or a complete thought, and defining the rules for greeting each other and exchanging information. These standards are roughly equivalent to the Session, Presentation and Application Layers of the [[OSI model]]. * '''NTCIP Transport Level''' — Transport standards define the rules and procedures for exchanging the Application data between point 'A' and point 'X' on a network, including any necessary routing, message disassembly/re-assembly and network management functions. This is similar to the rules and procedures used by the telephone company to connect two remotely located telephones. Transportation level standards are roughly equivalent to the Transport and Network Layers of the [[OSI model]]. * '''NTCIP Subnetwork Level''' — Subnetwork standards define the rules and procedures for exchanging data between two 'adjacent' devices over some communications media. This is equivalent to the rules used by the telephone company to exchange data over a cellular link versus the rules used to exchange data over a twisted pair copper wire. These standards are roughly equivalent to the Data Link and Physical Layers of the [[OSI model]]. * '''NTCIP Plant Level''' — The Plant Level is shown in the NTCIP Framework only as a means of providing a point of reference to those learning about NTCIP. The Plant Level includes the communications infrastructure over which NTCIP communications standards are to be used and has a direct impact on the selection of an appropriate Subnetwork Level for use over the selected communications infrastructure. The NTCIP standards do not prescribe any one media type over another. In most cases, communications media selections are made early in the design phase. The NTCIP Framework does not preclude combinations beyond those expressly indicated on the diagram. ==References== <references /> ==External links== *[http://www.ntcip.org/ NTCIP] (Official website) *[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9001 The NTCIP Guide] (NTCIP 9001 v04) *[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9012 Testing Guide for NTCIP Center-to-Field Communications] (NTCIP 9012 v01) *[http://www.standards.its.dot.gov/ US Department of Transportation ITS Standards Program] (USDOT) *[http://www.nema.org/ National Electrical Manufacturers Association] (NEMA) *[http://www.transportation.org American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials] (AASHTO) *[http://www.ite.org Institute of Transportation Engineers] (ITE) [[Category:Intelligent transportation systems]] [[Category:Application layer protocols]] [[Category:Open standards]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25905</id> <title>National accounts</title> <text>{{Economics sidebar}} '''National accounts''' or '''national account systems (NAS)''' are the implementation of complete and consistent accounting [[Scientific technique|technique]]s for measuring the economic activity of a nation (or other geographic area in the broader term '''social accounts'''). These include detailed underlying measures that rely on [[double-entry accounting]]. By construction such accounting makes the totals on both sides of an account equal even though they each measure different characteristics.<ref name="Ruggles">Nancy D. Ruggles, 1987.
