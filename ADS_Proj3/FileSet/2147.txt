It was originally developed by [[BioWare]] for a prototype [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] game codenamed ''Battleground Infinity'', which was ultimately re-engineered to become the first installment of the [[Baldur's Gate series|''Baldur's Gate'' series]]. BioWare used it again in the subsequent installments of the series, but also licensed the engine to [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s [[Black Isle Studios]]. ''Infinity Engine'' features [[Time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|pausable realtime]] gameplay. The engine uses a [[Video games with isometric graphics|three quarters perspective]] with [[pre-rendered]] [[2D computer graphics|2D backgrounds]] and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]-based characters. Although graphically 2D for the most part, [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn|Baldur's Gate II]] added the use of [[OpenGL]] to accelerate drawing. Designed for six-character [[Party (role playing games)|party-based]] adventuring by default, the Infinity Engine was the [[spiritual successor]] to the [[Gold Box]] Engine,{{Fact|date=February 2008}} and provided the basis for five ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' licensed computer role-playing games plus additional [[expansion pack]]s and a number of fanmade [[Mod (computer gaming)#Total conversion|total conversion]] RPGs. It was succeeded by BioWare's [[Aurora Engine]]. A [[free software|free]] compatible [[game engine recreation]] is in development under the name of [[GemRB]]. It runs on multiple platforms, including [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[AmigaOS 4]].<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.amigans.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1303 |title=GemRB for AmigaOS4 released |publisher=Amigans.net |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2010-12-02 }}</ref> Entire suites of reverse-engineered modding tools were written for Windows, Mac OS, and OS X in the engine's heyday.<ref>{{Wayback |url=http://ire.mainecoon.net/|title=Adventurers' Spa & Grill - Index & News|date=20040131204613}}</ref> ==Games using Infinity Engine== [[File:Planescape start-room.jpg|thumb|alt=Gameplay screenshot of Planescape Torment.|The Infinity Engine in action, from the game ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'']] The following games and expansions are powered by the Infinity Engine: *''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' (1998) **''[[Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast]]'' (1999) *''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' (1999) *''[[Icewind Dale]]'' (2000) **''[[Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter]]'' (2001) **''[[Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter#Trials of the Luremaster|Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter: Trials of the Luremaster]]'' (2001) *''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'' (2000) **''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal]]'' (2001) *''[[Icewind Dale II]]'' (2002) == References == {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.bioware.com/ BioWare] official website * [http://iesdp.info/ Infinity Engine Structures Description Project] * [http://www.uvlist.net/groups/info/infinityengine Infinity Engine full games list] * [http://gemrb.sourceforge.net/ Infinity Engine clone GemRB] {{Bioware games}} {{Video game engines}} [[Category:AmigaOS 4 games]] [[Category:BioWare]] [[Category:Infinity Engine games| ]] [[Category:Lua-scriptable game engines]] [[Category:Video game engines]] [[fr:Infinity Engine]] [[pl:Infinity Engine]] [[ru:Infinity Engine]] [[sk:Infinity Engine]] [[fi:Infinity Engine]] [[zh:无限引擎]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18230</id> <title>Info-Mac</title> <text>{{Infobox website | name = Info-Mac | logo = [[Image:Info mac logo.png|245px]] | screenshot = [[Image:Info mac.png|280px]] | caption = Screenshot of Info-Mac as of 2010-09-02. | url = http://www.info-mac.org/ | commercial = Yes | type = [[Forum]], [[news aggregator]], and [[file hosting service]] for [[Macintosh]] and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. | language = English | registration = Optional | owner = Dan Palka | author = Ed Pattermann | launch date = 1984 | current status = Open | slogan = The original online Mac user community. }}'''Info-Mac''' is an [[online community]], [[news aggregator]] and [[shareware]] [[file hosting service]] covering [[Apple Inc.]] products, including the [[iPhone]], [[iPod]] and especially the [[Macintosh]]. Established in 1984 as an [[electronic mailing list]], Info-Mac is notable as being the first online community for Apple's then-new Macintosh computer.<ref>Rittner, Don (2000).

At the time, disk space on a server was cost-prohibitive. Free archives such as Info-Mac were often the only means for shareware authors to deliver their product over the Internet. Some early commercial software download sites, like [[CNET|CNET's]] Shareware.com, were originally mirrors of the Info-Mac Archive.<ref>[http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-810.html#lnk4 TidBITS#810/19-Dec-05<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Info-Mac also periodically published [[CD-ROMs|CD-ROM]] containing Mac OS shareware and freeware from the archive, to be sold through Mac-related magazines and publications.<ref>''The Multimedia and Cd-ROM Directory 1998''.
