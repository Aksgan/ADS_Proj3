[3]), which can be used to formally define the notion of a ''normal form'' for natural deduction. The substitution theorem of natural deduction takes the form of a [[structural rule]] or structural theorem known as ''cut'' in the sequent calculus. ; Cut (substitution) : ''If'' Γ ⇒ π<sub>1</sub> : ''A'' ''and'' Γ, ''u'':''A'' ⇒ π<sub>2</sub> : ''C'', ''then'' Γ ⇒ [π<sub>1</sub>/u] π<sub>2</sub> : ''C''. In most well behaved logics, cut is unnecessary as an inference rule, though it remains provable as a meta-theorem; the superfluousness of the cut rule is usually presented as a computational process, known as ''cut elimination''. This has an interesting application for natural deduction; usually it is extremely tedious to prove certain properties directly in natural deduction because of an unbounded number of cases. For example, consider showing that a given proposition is ''not'' provable in natural deduction. A simple inductive argument fails because of rules like ∨E or E which can introduce arbitrary propositions. However, we know that the sequent calculus is complete with respect to natural deduction, so it is enough to show this unprovability in the sequent calculus. Now, if cut is not available as an inference rule, then all sequent rules either introduce a connective on the right or the left, so the depth of a sequent derivation is fully bounded by the connectives in the final conclusion. Thus, showing unprovability is much easier, because there are only a finite number of cases to consider, and each case is composed entirely of sub-propositions of the conclusion. A simple instance of this is the ''global consistency'' theorem: "{{Unicode|⋅}} {{Unicode|⊢}} ⊥ ''true''" is not provable. In the sequent calculus version, this is manifestly true because there is no rule that can have "{{Unicode|⋅}} ⇒ ⊥" as a conclusion! Proof theorists often prefer to work on cut-free sequent calculus formulations because of such properties. <!-- TODO ==Comparison with other foundational approaches== ===Hilbert-style axiomatic systems=== ===Combinatorial approaches=== Compare with the [[Calculus of Structures]], [[Display Logic]]s, and [[Proof-Net]]s. ===Categorical and model-theoretic approaches=== --> == See also == {{Col-begin}} {{Col-1-of-3}} {{Col-2-of-3}} {{Col-3-of-3}} {{Portal|Logic}} {{Col-end}} ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==References== ===Historical references=== * Stanaslaw Jaśkowski, 1934.

Or, it is something a set of things (objects, events, beings) has in common which distinguishes it from other things ''as a real set'' rather than as a group of things arbitrarily lumped together by a person or group of people. If any natural kinds exist at all, good candidates might include each of the [[chemical element]]s, like [[gold]] or [[potassium]]. Physical particles, like [[quark]]s, might also be natural kinds. That is, they would still be groups of things, distinct from other things as a group, even if there were no people around to say that they were members of the same group. The set of objects that weigh more than 50 pounds, on the other hand, almost certainly does not comprise a natural kind. A person might group those objects together for some purpose like shipping costs, but there is no particular reason that any other person should lump those objects together instead of placing them in some other grouping. There is considerable debate in philosophy about whether there are any natural kinds at all, and if so, what they are. [[Philosophy of biology|Philosophers of biology]] argue about whether biological [[species]], like the [[Bald Eagle]] (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''), are natural kinds. Others debate whether [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], sexes, or sexual orientations are natural kinds. [[Meteorology|Meteorologists]] classify a number of different kinds of [[clouds]], but it is not clear whether they are ''really'' different kinds, or whether those groups merely reflect the classifying interests of human beings. A more formal definition has it that a natural kind is a family of "[[entities]] possessing properties bound by [[natural law]]; we know of natural kinds in the form
