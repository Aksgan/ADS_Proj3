The company is headquartered in Boston, MA. The company’s flagship software, Invention Machine Goldfire, helps manufacturers to make innovation a repeatable, sustainable process<ref>http://money.cnn.com/2009/12/17/technology/invention_machine.fortune/index.htm</ref>. <br /><br /> ==Platform== [http://inventionmachine.com/products-and-services/innovation-software/ Invention Machine Goldfire] is innovation software that combines workflows for common innovation tasks (such as understanding market or technology trends, designing new products, identifying potential failure points in new products, and finding new markets for existing [[Intellectual_property|Intellectual Property]]) and processes (innovation trend analysis, [[root cause analysis]], device/process analysis, [[function modeling]], [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]], FMECA, HACCP or HAZOP), collaboration capabilities, and [[semantic search]] technology. <br /><br />Goldfire is typically used by engineers, scientists, inventors, and researchers at global manufacturers, as well as research facilities and universities worldwide. ==History== The story behind Invention Machine dates back to the late 1980s when a flock of technologies made their way out of the dissolving Soviet Union into the rest of the world. One of the technologies that emerged was the product of decades of research conducted in Russia since the late 1940s by [[Genrich Altshuller]], a Soviet engineer and inventor.<br /><br /> Altshuller sifted through reams of patents covering successful inventions, organizing them according to the physical principles and basic mechanisms they contained. Using this analysis, he developed a set of what he called ‘Inventive Principles’ that could be taught to engineers, scientists, and inventors who wanted to be more productive. Altshuller's method became known by the acronym [[TRIZ]], which is Russian for "the theory of solving inventor's problems."<ref>http://www.triz-journal.com/whatistriz_orig.htm</ref> Invention Machine’s innovation software is based on this methodology, among others.<br /><br />Since its inception in 1992, Invention Machine’s efforts have been solely focused on the development and implementation of innovation software designed to aid manufacturers<ref>http://www.designnews.com/blog/CAD_CAM_Corner/1888-Invention_Machines_Case_For_Sustainable_Innovation.php</ref> with identifying, validating, and ranking ideas, streamlining the ideation to productization process, and fueling pipelines with competitively differentiated products. <br /><br />In late 2002, [http://inventionmachine.com/about-us/management/ Mark E. Atkins] joined the company as Chairman, President, and CEO. Since that time, Atkins has overseen a broadening of the features of Invention Machine’s innovation software, Goldfire. Today, the company is growing, profitable, cash-positive, and debt-free. ==Recent Awards== * 2010 AlwaysOn: East Top 100 Companies<ref>http://www.aonetwork.com/AOStory/Introducing-AlwaysOn-East-Top-100-Companies-0</ref> * Blogging Innovation: 2010 Top 40 Innovation Bloggers<ref>http://www.business-strategy-innovation.com/wordpress/2010/09/top-40-innovation-bloggers-of-2010-4/</ref> * 2009 AlwaysOn: East Top 100 Companies<ref>http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/32212</ref> * 2009 Managing Automation: Progressive Manufacturing PM100<ref>http://inventionmachine.com/news-and-events/press-releases/archive/bid/48734/MAGNET-Wins-Managing-Automation-2009-Progressive-Manufacturing-And-Innovation-Mastery-Awards</ref> * 2009 Bell Ringer Awards: Product/Service Launch: High-tech Business-to-Business Campaign entry "Driving Sustainable Innovation with Invention Machine Goldfire 5.0" * 2009 MBT Innovation Insight Award: Customer Award, MAGNET Siphon Flush<ref>http://www.managingautomation.com/maonline/magazine/read/view/High_Achiever_Innovation_Mastery_Magnet_Product_Design_amp_Development_249920</ref> * Managing Automation: A Company to Watch<ref>http://www.managingautomation.com/maonline/magazine/read/view/A_Company_to_Watch_Invention_Machine_237892</ref> ==References== <!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://InventionMachine.com/ InventionMachine.com] <!--- Categories ---> [[Category: Software companies of the United States]] [[Category: Innovation organizations]] [[Category: Companies based in Massachusetts]] [[Category: Companies based in Boston, Massachusetts]] [[Category: Innovators]] [[Category: Innovation Software]] [[Category: TRIZ]] [[Category: Product lifecycle management]] [[Category: Product management]] [[Category: Collaborative software]] [[Category: Semantics]] [[Category: Knowledge management]] [[Category: Software companies]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19270</id> <title>Inventory</title> <text>In the USA and Canada the term has developed from a list of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] and [[materials]] to the goods and materials themselves, especially those held available in stock by a [[business]]; and this has become the primary meaning of the term in North American English, equivalent to the term "stock" in British English. In accounting, inventory or stock is considered an [[asset]]. <!-- leftover from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inventory&diff=next&oldid=279478790 : Labels: Inventory Management, Procurement, Supply Chain, Supply Chain Management --> ''Inventory management'' is primarily about specifying the size and placement of stocked goods. Inventory management is required at different locations within a facility or within multiple locations of a supply network to protect the regular and planned course of production against the random disturbance of running out of materials or goods. The scope of inventory management also concerns the fine lines between replenishment lead time, carrying costs of inventory, asset management, inventory forecasting, inventory valuation, inventory visibility, future inventory price forecasting, physical inventory, available physical space for inventory, quality management, replenishment, returns and defective goods and demand forecasting. Balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal
