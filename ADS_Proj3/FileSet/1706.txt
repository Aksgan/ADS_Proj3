The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world. [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]]; the establishment of classical [[German idealism]] by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]; [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s composition of metaphysical pessimism; [[Karl Marx]]'s and [[Friedrich Engels]]' formulation of [[communist theory]]; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s development of [[perspectivism]]; [[Gottlob Frege]]'s contributions to the dawn of [[analytic philosophy]]; [[Martin Heidegger]]'s works on Being; and the development of the [[Frankfurt school]] by [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] have been particularly influential. In the 21st century Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.
