cause many more bits to flip. The design of error detection and correction circuits is helped by the fact that soft errors usually are localised to a very small area of a chip. Usually, only one cell of a memory is affected, although high energy events can cause a multi-cell upset. Conventional memory layout usually places one bit of many different correction words adjacent on a chip. So, even a ''multi-cell upset'' leads to only a number of separate ''[[Single event upset|single-bit upsets]]'' in multiple correction words, rather than a ''multi-bit upset'' in a single correction word. So, an error correcting code needs only to cope with a single bit in error in each correction word in order to cope with all likely soft errors. The term 'multi-cell' is used for upsets affecting multiple cells of a memory, whatever correction words those cells happen to fall in. 'Multi-bit' is used when multiple bits in a single correction word are in error. ==Soft errors in combinational logic== The three natural masking effects in [[combinational logic]] that determine whether a [[single event upset]] (SEU) will propagate to become a soft error are [[electrical masking]], [[logical masking]], and [[temporal (or timing-window) masking]]. An SEU is ''logically masked'' if its propagation is blocked from reaching an output latch because off-path gate inputs prevent a logical transition of that gate's output. An SEU is ''electrically masked'' if the signal is attenuated by the electrical properties of gates on its propagation path such that the resulting pulse is of insufficient magnitude to be reliably latched. An SEU is ''temporally masked'' if the erroneous pulse reaches an output latch, but it does occur close enough to when the latch is actually triggered to hold. If all three masking effects fail to occur, the propagated pulse becomes latched and the output of the logic circuit will be an erroneous value. In the context of circuit operation, this erroneous output value may be considered a soft error event. However, from a microarchitectural-level standpoint, the affected result may not change the output of the currently-executing program. For instance, the erroneous data could be overwritten before use, masked in subsequent logic operations, or simply never be used. If erroneous data does not affect the output of a program, it is considered to be an example of ''microarchitectural masking''. == Soft error rate == Soft error rate (SER) is the rate at which a device or system encounters or is predicted to encounter soft errors. It is typically expressed as either number of failures-in-time (FIT), or [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF). The unit adopted for quantifying failures in time is called FIT, equivalent to 1 error per billion hours of device operation. MTBF is usually given in years of device operation. To put it in perspective, 1 year MTBF is equal to approximately 114,077 FIT. While many electronic systems have an MTBF that exceeds the expected lifetime of the circuit, the SER may still be unacceptable to the manufacturer or customer. For instance, many failures per million circuits due to soft errors can be expected in the field if the system does not have adequate soft error protection. The failure of even a few products in the field, particularly if catastrophic, can tarnish the reputation of the product and company that designed it. Also, in safety- or cost-critical applications where the cost of system failure far outweighs the cost of the system itself, a 1% chance of soft error failure per lifetime may be too high to be acceptable to the customer. Therefore, it is advantageous to design for low SER when manufacturing a system in high-volume or requiring extremely high reliability. == See also == * [[Single event upset]] * [[Radiation hardening]] == External links == * [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0123695295 Book on "Architecture Design for Soft Errors" by Shubu Mukherjee, published by Elsevier, Inc.] Book review by Max Baron of Microprocessor Report (May 27, 2008), “Dr. Shubu Mukherjee’s book is a welcome surprise: books by architecture leaders in major companies are few and far between.
