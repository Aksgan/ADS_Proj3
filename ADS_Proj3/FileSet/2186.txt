All data is reviewed by consultants continuously to maintain high quality. ==Modules== iNFCIS presently includes the follow databases and a simulation tool: *The '''Nuclear fuel cycle information system''' (NFCIS) is a scenario based computer tool for the estimation of nuclear fuel cycle material and service requirements developed by the IAEA. NFCSS is developed based on a model designed to estimate long-term nuclear fuel cycle requirements and actinide arisings. *The '''World distribution of uranium deposits database''' (UDEPO) is an on-line database of uranium deposits around the world maintained by the IAEA. *The '''Post irradiation examination facilities database''' (PIEDB) is a catalogue of hot laboratories maintained by the IAEA. *The '''Minor actinide property database''' (MADB) is a bibliographic database of physico-chemical properties of selected [[minor actinide]] compounds and alloys. *The '''Nuclear fuel cycle simulation system''' (NFCSS) is a scenario based tool to estimate material flow in the nuclear fuel cycle. ==Publications== The following are the print publications based on iNFCIS: *Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System:A Directory of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities 2009 Edition<ref>{{cite book | title = Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System: A Directory of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities 2009 Edition | url = http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1613_web.pdf | publisher = IAEA | year = 2009 | author = IAEA}} </ref> *The Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System, 1996 Edition<ref>{{cite book | title = Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System | url = | publisher = IAEA | year = 1996 | author = IAEA}} </ref> *The Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System<ref>{{cite book | title = The Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System | url = | publisher = IAEA | year = 1987 | author = IAEA}} </ref> *World Distribution of Uranium Deposits (UDEPO), with Uranium Deposit Classification<ref>{{cite book | title = World Distribution of Uranium Deposits (UDEPO), with Uranium Deposit Classification, 2009 Edition | url = http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/TE_1629_web.pdf | publisher = IAEA | year = 2009 | author = IAEA}} </ref> ==See also== *[[Nuclear reprocessing]] *[[Nuclear fission product]] *[[Activation product]] *[[Reprocessed uranium]] *[[Plutonium]] *[[MOX fuel]] *[[Uranium mining]] *[[Enriched uranium]] *[[Post Irradiation Examination]] *[[Spent nuclear fuel]] *[[Spent nuclear fuel shipping cask]] ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==External Links== *[http://www-nfcis.iaea.org IAEA - Integrated nuclear fuel cycle information system] - (Free registration required) [[Category:Databases]] [[Category:International Atomic Energy Agency]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18657</id> <title>Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Refimprove|date=October 2008}} '''Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers''', also abbreviated to '''Isis''', is a specialized software package developed by the [[USGS]] to [[Image processing|process images]] and spectra collected by current and past NASA planetary missions sent to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and other solar system bodies.

The origins of OPC are based on [[Microsoft]]'s OLE, COM and DCOM technology and today's OPC set of standards allow field systems and other devices, automation and control applications and business applications to communicate acquired real-time and historical data and records to enterprise systems and between production devices from multiple vendors.
