The current cost per month for the feature is $10, users are given a generous amount of content for the monthly fee. AutoCash can be charged to a credit or debit card and members may also pay for the feature using a [[PayPal]] account. The service can be canceled at anytime, staying past 3 months offers users the bonues of receiving items specifically designed and made for those that continue to use the AutoCash feature. The benefits of using AutoCash include: * 1000 Gaia Cash every month * 200 Bonus Gaia Cash every month * An exclusive item for every 3 months of concurrent participation in the feature * 10% off all Cash Shop purchases until October 31st Users can still purchase Gaia Cash via GaiaOnline and do not have to purchase Gaia Cash via the AutoCash feature. Users that sign up for the AutoCash feature will notice that any items they purchase using Gaia Cash will be frozen for 7 days. The item(s) purchased are usable but cannot be sold or gifted to other members. Currently the system that is in place is not able to determine the source of the Gaia Cash so if a user signed up for the monthly feature and also purchased Gaia Cash via another source (i.e. cash card, PayPal, on site purchase) any items bought with Gaia Cash will be frozen for 7 days. ===Market=== Sales within the Gaian market can be divided into four areas - Gold Shops, Cash Shops, Trade, and Marketplace. * ''Gold Shops'': Items from these stores can be bought with Gold or Gaia Cash (most users purchase with Gold), and can range from regular store items to upmarket items. These are various NPC-run stores which sell a variety of items, such as avatar clothing and accessories, furniture for Gaia Houses, and parts for Gaia Cars. Items found in the shops can also be sold back to the shop for 50% of the shop price. * ''Cash Shops'': Items from these stores can be purchased with Gaia Cash only. The majority of Gaia Cash sales are from La Victoire, an NPC-run store that only accepts Gaia Cash. It specializes in high-end items, including "Evolving Items" and "Random Item Generators". "Monthly Collectibles" can also be purchased from La Victoire. As the name suggests, Monthly Collectibles are only available for one month before being replaced with the next month's Monthly Collectible. Most items from La Victoire are continuously rotated in and out of the store. Other Cash-Only stores include "Phin Phang" (Gaia Aquarium items), and "Back Alley Bargains" (power-up items for Gaia's [[MMORPG]], "zOMG!"). * ''Trade'': Users can trade items and gold with other users. A majority of these trades are settled in the "Gaia Exchange" forum (and its sub-forums). * ''Marketplace'': The Marketplace is a separate area of the site for users to buy and sell items. Rather than self-auctioning an item through a thread in the Exchange forum, users can either put their item up for immediate sale with a "Buy Now" price, or leave their item for auction with a starting "Bid" price. Users can have up to 10 items for sale at once, and each item can be listed for a maximum of 14 days. The cost of this convenience is a 2% tax on all gold earned from sales. ===Notable Items=== ====Monthly Collectibles==== '''Monthly Collectibles''' (previously known as '''Donation Items''', also referred to as '''MCs''') are special items that can be bought with real money meant to support Gaia's maintenance and costs. Established in June 2003 after users of Gaia Online petitioned for a "donation system" in an attempt to increase site revenue, for every US $2.50 a user gives to the site,<ref name="gigaom" /> he or she receives an item known as a "Sealed Envelope" in his or her inventory. Sealed Envelopes go on sale the first day of every month and are released on the 15th of each month. During August & September 2008 the envelopes were unsealed on the 8th, but on October 2, 2008 it was decided that the release date should be returned to the fifteenth. The Sealed Envelope disappears from the user's inventory and is replaced by a "Thank You Letter" for the current paid month (for example, a "Thank You Letter for August 2004" represents a payment made in that month of that year). Users are then able to open these virtual letters to choose one of two or three limited-edition items to be granted into their inventory from each letter. <!-- Please do not change the sentence about the number of items without first discussing on the talk page. Thank you --> These items were known as Donation Items until potential legal problems prompted the name change.<ref>{{cite web | last = Liu | first = Ereka | title = Donation items name changed
