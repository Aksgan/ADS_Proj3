The public wanted to believe in "wonder drugs". Unfortunately, according to Whitaker the reasons the pharmaceutical companies gave for the drugs working (too much or too little [[dopamine]] or [[serotonin]] in the patient's brain) have not proved to be true.<ref>Whitaker, part two, chapters 3, 4 and 5</ref> ===Psychiatric drugs=== While Whitaker is pro-drug, he believes that medication must be used in a "selective, cautious manner. It should be understood that they’re not fixing any chemical imbalances.

They saw that antipsychotics knocked down psychotic symptoms, and they observed that patients who stopped taking their medications regularly became psychotic again."<ref>Whitaker, p. 108</ref>}} In contrast, Whitaker can only offer as a "solution" the style of care documented by professor Jaakko Seikkula at Keropudas Hospital in [[Tornio]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] where drugs are given to patients only on a limited basis—with good outcomes. According to Whitaker, the district has the lowest per capita spending on mental health of all health districts in [[Finland]].<ref>Whitaker, p. 343</ref> ===Children=== Whitaker sees that children are vulnerable to being prescribed a ''lifetime'' of drugs. As the author says, a psychiatrist and parents may give a child a "cocktail" to force him or her to behave. Then when this child grows up to eighteen, Whitaker says he or she becomes a disabled adult.<ref>Whitaker, chapters 11 and 12</ref> ==Review of data and statistics== Over the year and a half he spent researching this book,<ref name="Whitaker, p. 210"/> Whitaker thoroughly reviewed U.S. government statistics and evidence in the scientific literature.<ref>[[Joseph Mercola]] says Whitaker has done his homework, and spent thousands (or tens of thousands) of hours on research in {{cite video|title=Dr. Mercola and Robert Whitaker Discuss Mental Health (part 3 of 7)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx2HiLyJ0-0|date=April 29, 2010|publisher=Joseph Mercola via YouTube|time=1:50|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> He maintains a website where the scientific studies are linked.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Mad in America|url=http://www.madinamerica.com/|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> ==Reception and media coverage== {{expand section|what the reviews said|date=November 2010}} Whitaker, who was a finalist for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service and is an
