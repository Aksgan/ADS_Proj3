wording of the offence should be clarified to confirm that all forms of [[denial of service]] attack are included.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} ==Latest situation== <!-- need a paragraph here about notable convictions under the act --> In 2004, the All-Party Internet Group published its review of the law and highlighted areas for development. Their recommendations led to the drafting of the ''Computer Misuse Act 1990 (Amendment) Bill'' which sought to amend the CMA to comply with the European Convention on Cyber Crime[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm]. Under its terms, the maximum sentence of imprisonment for breaching the Act changed from six months to two years. It also sought to explicitly criminalise [[denial-of-service attack]]s and other crimes facilitated by denial-of-service. The Bill did not receive [[Royal Assent]] because Parliament was [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]]. Sections 35 to 38 of the [[Police and Justice Act 2006]] contains amendments to the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Section 37 (''Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in computer misuse offences'') inserts a new section 3A into the 1990 Act and has drawn considerable criticism from IT professionals, as many of their tools can be used by the forces of evil in addition to their legitimate purposes, and thus fall under section 3A. ==See also== * [[Computer crime]] * [[Internet fraud]] ==References== * Stefan Fafinski, ''Computer Misuse: Response, Regulation and the Law'' (Cullomption, Willan 2009) * Yaman Akdeniz, ''Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990: an Antidote for Computer Viruses!''

The Center was founded in the 1950s as the '''Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center'''. The CMC is housed on 125th Street in [[New York City]]. It consists of a large graduate research facility specializing in computer music and multimedia research, as well as a number of [[musical composition|composition]] and [[recording studio]]s for student use. Projects to come out of the CMC since the 1990s include: * [[Real-Time Cmix]] * [[PeRColate]] * [[dorkbot]] * [[ArtBots]] The Computer Music Center has no degree program of its own, and draws students from throughout the Columbia community, primarily from the departments of [[music]], [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]], [[visual arts]], [[film]], intellectual property [[law]], and [[psychology]]. The director of the CMC is [[Brad Garton]], and the CMC offers classes taught by [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], [[Terry Pender]], [[Douglas Repetto]], and [[R. Luke DuBois]], as well as a large number of visiting faculty who give seminars every year. ==History== <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cpemc2.jpg|thumb|left|500px|The Electronic Music Center Staff mid-1970s]] --> The forerunner of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center was a studio founded in the early 1950s by [[Columbia University]] professors [[Vladimir Ussachevsky]] and [[Otto Luening]], and [[Princeton University]] professors [[Milton Babbitt]] and [[Roger Sessions]]. Originally concerned with experiments in music [[musical composition|composition]] involving the new technology of reel-to-reel [[tape music|tape]], the studio soon branched out into all areas of electronic music research. The Center was officially established with a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in 1959 which was used to finance the acquisition of the [[RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer]] from its owner, RCA. The flagship piece of Center equipment, the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer, was delivered to the Center in 1957 after it was developed to Ussachevsky and Babbitt's specifications. The RCA (and the Center) were re-housed in Prentis Hall, a building off the main Columbia campus on 125th Street. A number of significant pieces in the electronic music repertoire were realized on the Synthesizer, including Babbitt's ''Vision and Prayer'' and [[Charles Wuorinen]]'s ''Time's Encomium''. In 1961 [[Columbia Records]] released an album titled simply ''[[Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (album)|Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center]]'', which was produced principally on the RCA synthesizer. Most of the luminaries in the field of electronic music (and [[avant-garde]] music in general) visited, worked, or studied at the Electronic Music Center, including [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Halim El-Dabh]], [[Bülent Arel]], [[Mario Davidovsky]], [[Charles Dodge]], [[Pril Smiley]], [[Alice Shields]], [[Wendy Carlos]], and [[Luciano Berio]]. The Center also acted as a [[Consultant|consulting]] agency for other electronic music studios in the [[Western Hemisphere]], giving them advice on optimum studio design and helping them to purchase equipment, etc. The staff engineers at the Center under [[Peter Mauzey]] developed a large variety of customized equipment designed to solve the needs of the composers working at the center. These include early prototypes of [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] machines, [[quadraphonic]] mixing consoles, and analog [[trigger pad|trigger]]s designed to facilitate [[interoperability]] between other (often custom-made) synthesizer equipment. The Center also had a large collection of [[Buchla]], [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], and [[Serge Modular]] synthesizers. By the late 1970s the Electronic Music Center was rapidly nearing obsolescence as the classical [[analog (signal)|analog]] tape techniques it used were being surpassed by parallel work in the field of [[computer music]]. By the mid 1980s the Columbia and Princeton facilities had ceased their formal affiliation, with the Princeton music department strengthening its affiliation with [[Bell Labs]] and founding a computer music studio under [[Godfrey Winham]] and [[Paul Lansky]] (see [[Princeton Sound Lab]]). The original Columbia facility was re-organized in 1995 under the leadership of [[Brad Garton]] and was renamed the Columbia University Computer Music Center. ==General
