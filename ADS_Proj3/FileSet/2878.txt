so programmers were forced to use [[CamelCase]] for compound identifiers --- a practice which was incorporated in PARC's standard programming style. On the other hand, Mesa designers adopted the left-pointing arrow '←' character, which took the place of underscore in the Alto keyboard, for the assignment operator. When the MESA designers wanted to implement an exception facility, they hired a recent M.S. graduate from Colorado who had written his thesis on exception handling facilities in algorithmic languages. This led to the richest exception facility for its time, with primitives : SIGNAL, ERROR, ABORT, RETRY, CATCH, and CONTINUE. Because the language did not have type-safe checks to verify proper signal handling, uncaught exceptions were a common cause of bugs in released software. ==Descendants== *Mesa was the precursor to the programming language Cedar.<ref name="cedar1">{{cite book | url = http://research.microsoft.com/lampson/32a-CedarLang/32a-CedarLangAbstract.htm | title = A Description of the Cedar Language | author = Butler Lampson | authorlink = Butler Lampson | publisher = Xerox PARC Technical Report | issue = CSL-83-15}}</ref><ref name="cedar2">{{cite journal | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806844 | title = The Structure of Cedar | author = D.

Xerox PARC employees argued that MESA was a proprietary advantage that made Xerox software engineers more productive than engineers at other companies.

This was a workable solution but made it nearly impossible to develop on the Unix machines since the power of the Mesa compiler and associated tool chain was lost using this approach. There was some commercial success on Sun SPARC workstations in the publishing world, but this approach resulted in isolating the product to narrow market opportunities. *In 1976, during a sabbatical at Xerox PARC, [[Niklaus Wirth]] became acquainted with Mesa, which had a major influence in the design of his [[Modula-2]] language <ref>{{cite journal | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1238847 | title = Modula-2 and Oberon | author = Niklaus Wirth | work = Proc. 3rd Conf.

It was initially developed by [[Brian Paul]] in August 1993. As of April 2008, it is the only commonly known, fully [[open source]] implementation of OpenGL which is continually updated to support the latest OpenGL [[specification]]. It is widely used, most importantly by the [[X.Org]] implementation of the [[X Window System]] where it serves as the OpenGL core for the open-source X.Org/DRI OpenGL drivers. X.Org provides the essential functionality used by most graphical [[Application software|applications]] which run on [[Unix-like]] platforms such as [[GNU]]/[[Linux]]. It supports OpenGL version 2.1, along with several extensions from OpenGL 3 and 4. == History == Initially, Mesa 3D started off by rendering all [[3D computer graphics]] on the [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], but the architecture of Mesa 3D was open to implement [[graphics processing unit|graphics processor]]-accelerated 3D rendering in Mesa 3D. Once 3D [[graphics cards]] became mainstream on PC hardware, companies began working on adding support for hardware-accelerated 3D rendering to Mesa 3D. The library was one of the first drivers to support hardware-acceleration via the 3dfx [[Glide API]] driver for the very popular [[Voodoo Graphics|Voodoo]] I/II [[graphics card]]s and others as well. All rendering was done indirectly in the [[X server]], leaving some overhead and speed lagging behind the theoretical maximum. The [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]] (DRI) finally succeeded in providing an interface for direct 3D rendering by the OpenGL applications and was officially added to Mesa 3D. === Features ===
