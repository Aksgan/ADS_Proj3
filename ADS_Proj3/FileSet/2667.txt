The runners-up received $250 each. ===2008=== The 2008 competition was organised by Professor Kevin Warwick, coordinated by Huma Shah and held on 12 October at the University of Reading, [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2008_Contest/loebner-prize-2008.html 18th Annual Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence 12 October 2008 University of Reading, Reading, UK]</ref> After testing by over one hundred judges during the preliminary phase, in June and July 2008, six finalists were selected from thirteen original entrants - [[artificial conversational entity]] (ACE). Five of those invited competed in the finals: *Brother Jerome, Peter Cole and Benji Adams *[[Elbot]], Fred Roberts / Artificial Solutions *[[Eugene Goostman]], Vladimir Veselov, Eugene Demchenko and Sergey Ulasen *Jabberwacky, Rollo Carpenter *Ultra Hal, Robert Medeksza In the finals, each of the judges was given five minutes to conduct simultaneous, split-screen conversations with two hidden entities. Elbot<ref>[http://www.elbot.com/ Elbot]</ref> of Artificial Solutions<ref>[http://www.artificial-solutions.com/ Artificial Solutions]</ref> won the 2008 Loebner Prize bronze award, for ''most human-like'' artificial conversational entity, through fooling three of the twelve judges who interrogated it (in the human-parallel comparisons) into believing it was human. This is coming very close to the 30% traditionally required to consider that a program has actually passed the Turing test. Eugene Goostman<ref>[http://www.princetonai.com/bot/botProcess.jsp Eugene Goostman]</ref> and Ultra Hal<ref>[http://zabaware.com/assistant/ Ultra Hal]</ref> both deceived one judge each that it was the human.

The prize amount for 2009 was USD 3000. Entrants were David Levy, Rollo Carpenter, and Mohan Embar, who finished in that order.

The 2010 competition was the 20th running of the contest. ==Winners== Official list of winners.<ref>[http://loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html Winners of Previous Contests (section)], Lobner Prize's official page</ref> {|class="wikitable" !

It was manufactured by Mackie, but distributed by Emagic. About 6 months later, Mackie introduced a physically identical product called "Mackie Control" which included support for most major DAW applications, but not Logic. The Emagic Logic Control was still available and would only work with Logic. Later, Mackie Control's firmware was revised to include compatibility with Logic. The name of the Mackie Control was changed to "Mackie Control Universal" (MCU). Out of the box, MCU included Lexan overlays with different button legends to support control of other DAWs such as Pro Tools and Cubase. ==Description== Logic Control (and now MCU) allows to control almost all of Logic's parameters with its hardware
