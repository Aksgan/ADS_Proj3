having "sold out" their initial inventories of the devices. In June 2004 Apple opened their iTunes Music Store in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Germany]]. A [[European Union]] version opened October 2004 (actually, a [[Eurozone]] version; not initially available in the [[Republic of Ireland]] due to the intransigence of the [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] (IRMA) but eventually opened Thursday January 6, 2005.) A version for [[Canada]] opened in December 2004. On May 10, 2005, the iTunes Music Store was expanded to [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]]. On December 16, 2004, Apple sold its 200 millionth song on the iTunes Music Store to Ryan Alekman from [[Belchertown, Massachusetts|Belchertown]], [[Massachusetts]]. The download was ''[[The Complete U2]]'', by [[U2]].<ref>{{cite press release|date= December 16, 2004|url= http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/dec/16itunes.html|title= iTunes Music Store Downloads Top 200 Million Songs|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= 2006-05-04}}</ref> Just under three months later Apple sold its 300 millionth song on March 2, 2005.<ref>{{cite press release|date= March 2, 2005|url= http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/mar/02itms.html|title= iTunes Music Store Downloads Surpass 300 Million|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= 2006-05-04}}</ref> On July 17, 2005, the iTunes Music Store sold its 500 millionth song.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} At that point, songs were selling at an accelerating annualized rate of more than 500 million. On January 11, 2005, an even smaller version of the iPod was announced, this one based on flash memory instead of using a miniaturized hard drive. The iPod Shuffle, like its predecessors, proved so popular that it sold out almost immediately, causing delays of up to four weeks in obtaining one within a single week of its debut.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This is despite the fact that critics had gawked at the lack of LCD screen in the Shuffle, a norm in almost all current flash memory based mp3 players. The iPod is giving an enormous lift to Apple's financial results.<ref>{{cite press release|date= April 13, 2005|url= http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/apr/13results.html|title= Apple Reports Second Quarter Results|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= 2006-05-04}}</ref> In the quarter ending March 26, 2005, Apple earned US$290 million, or 34¢ a share, on sales of US$3.24 billion. The year before in the same quarter, Apple earned just US$46 million, or 6¢ a share, on revenue of US$1.91 billion. In July 2005, the iPod was given a color screen, merging the iPod and iPod Photo. On September 7, 2005, Apple replaced the iPod Mini line with the new [[iPod Nano]]. While some consumers were put off by the high price tag (US$199 for 2 GB), and easily scratchable surface, the Nano had sold 1 million units in the first 17 days. A month later, on October 12, 2005 Apple introduced the new 5th generation iPod with video playback capabilities. The device is also 40% thinner than a 4th generation iPod and has a larger screen. On October 25, 2005, the iTunes Store went live in Australia, with songs selling for [[Australian dollar|A$]]1.69 each, albums at (generally) AU$16.99 and music videos and Pixar short films at AU$3.39. Briefly, people in [[New Zealand]] were able to buy music off the Australian store. However, that loophole was quickly closed. On February 23, 2006, the iTunes Music Store sold its 1 billionth song.<ref>{{cite press release|date= February 23, 2006|url= http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/feb/23itms.html|title= iTunes Music Store Downloads Top One Billion Songs|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= 2006-05-04}}</ref> The iTunes Music Store changed its name to iTunes Store on September 12, 2006 when it began offering video content (TV shows and movies) for sale.

It was another 12 months before the iPhone 3G became available on July 11, 2008. Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the U.S., Canada and major European countries on June 19. This 12-month iteration cycle has continued with the iPhone4 model arriving in similar fashion in 2010. January 2011 has also seen a Verizon model being announced with expected availability in February 2011. The Macs that are available now (Jan. 2011) are the 27'' iMac, the mac pro, the mac book, mac book air, mac book pro and the mac mini. The latest version or mac os x is Snow leopard (10.6). In summer 2011, Apple will have Mac OS X lion (10.7). On February 10, 2011, the Apple iPhone will be on Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Now 2 iPod types are touch screen (Jan. 2011), the iPod nano and the iPod touch, a big advance in technology. Apple TV now has a 2nd generation (Jan 2011) 4 times smaller, but 4 times better! And now Apple has gone wireless, Apple now has a wireless touch pad, a wireless keyboard, a wireless mouse, and even a wireless external hard drive. The Apple iPad was announced on January 27, 2010 with retail availability commencing in April and systematically growing in markets throughout 2010. The iPad fits into Apple product line snuggly, as an iOS device, twice the screen size of an iPhone without the phone capabilities. While there were initial fears of product cannibalisation the FY2010 financial results released in Jan 2011 included commentary of a reverse 'halo' effect, where iPad sales were leading to increased sales of iMacs and MacBooks.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/01/18results.html | title=Apple Reports First Quarter Results publisher=Apple Inc | date=January 18, 2011 | accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> Considering that both product ranges have only been in existence for a combined 4 years, the fact that over 70 million iPhones<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/10/18/apple-sold-14-1-million-iphones-last-quarter-over-70-million-since-launch/|title=Apple sold 14.1 million iPhones last quarter, over 70 million since launch|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|date=October 18, 2010|work=MobileCrunch|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref> and earning the company billions is a remarkable success.
