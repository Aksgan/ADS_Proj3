18 Years of Age): This film is forbidden for people younger than 18 years of age. It may contain strong language, explicit sexual content, frequent nudity, strong violence, or explicit scenes of drug abuse. It is also used to rate [[pornographic film]]s. Examples: ''[[Martyrs (film)|Martyrs]]'', ''[[Inside (2007 film)|Inside]]'', ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]... People younger than the minimum age indicated by the rating can watch the movie accompanied by their parents or an adult guardian, except for pornographic films. The films are rated by trained raters and, more recently, the DJCTQ has surveyed the audience's opinions on the ratings indicated for specific films. No "parental guidance" ratings are used. ==Bulgaria== The Bulgarian film rating system is defined in the [http://www.nfc.bg/page.php?category=110 Film Industry Law (or Act)] of 2003. The National Film Rating Committee examines every film that is going to be distributed in the country and gives it a rating. In practice, the ratings are rarely displayed on posters and in film advertisements, but almost all DVDs have them on the back cover. {| class="wikitable" |+ Bulgarian film ratings <!-- if required --> ! Rating ! Accompanying inscription ! When is it given |- | A | Recommended to children | "When the film is for children and has an educational nature." |- | B | No age restrictions | "When the film confirms the ideals of [[wiktionary:bg:хуманизъм|humanism]], promotes national and world culture or by no means contradicts to the universally accepted moral norms in the country and there are no restrictive recommendations by the Committee." |- | C | Not recommended to children younger than 12 years of age. | "When the film contains certain erotic scenes or scenes with drinking, taking drugs or stimulants or a few scenes of violence." |- | D | No people younger than 16 years of age are admitted. | "When the film contains quite a number of erotic scenes or scenes with drinking, taking drugs or stimulants or a considerable number of scenes showing violence." |- | X | No people younger than the age of 18 are admitted. | "When the film is naturally erotic." |- | E | | "Films the contents of which is contrary to the universal rules of morality, that laud or exculpate atrocity, violence or taking drugs, that incite to racial, sexual, religious or national hatred, are not rated." Note: unrated films can not be distributed, as no visa is given. |} Before 2003 there was another rating system which was very similar to the current one (the same letter ratings were used, but the meaning of most letters was different; for example "B" stood for "not recommended for persons under the age of 12"). In practice, the rating "B" is given to most popular American films, even if they receive a more restrictive one in other countries. In [[2007]], a few changes to the law were made, the effect of which will probably not be big for the rating system, though a film's rating could change. These changes are in effect from January 1, 2008. Note: parts of the table above uses quotes from the [http://www.filmmakersbg.org/zakon-kino-eng.htm English translation] of the [http://www.filmmakersbg.org/zakon-kino-bg.htm Bulgarian Film Industry Act] published on the website of the [http://www.filmmakersbg.org/ubfm-eng.htm Union of Bulgarian Film Makers]. ==Canada== {{Main|Canadian motion picture rating system}} Movie ratings in Canada are a provincial responsibility, and each province has its own legislation, rules and regulations regarding rating, exhibition and admission. Ratings are required for theatrical showings of movies, but are not required for home video. Film festivals which show unrated films (because they are independent films or foreign films not submitted for ratings) are treated as private showings by selling memberships to the festival, which circumvents the theatrical rating requirement. There are currently six film classification offices rating movies in Canada, each an agency of a provincial government: * in [[British Columbia]], [[Saskatchewan]] and the [[Yukon]], the '''[[British Columbia Film Classification Office]]'''; * in [[Alberta]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]], '''[[Alberta Film Ratings]]'''; * in [[Manitoba]], the '''[[Manitoba Film Classification Board]]'''; * in [[Ontario]], the '''[[Ontario Film Review Board]]'''; * in [[Quebec]], la '''[[Régie du cinéma (Quebec)|Régie du cinéma du Québec]]'''; * in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], the '''[[Maritime Film Classification Board]]'''. The province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] has not legislated on film ratings and does not have a dedicated agency; some theatres use the ratings of the Maritime Film Classification Board. ===Home video ratings=== {{details|Canadian Home Video Rating System}} ====Outside Québec==== {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- !

The ratings of the individual film boards are averaged and applied by the distributor on home video packaging. Major American studios and distributors usually print the CHVRS ratings along with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] ratings, on materials destined for North American markets. Canadian products for the Canadian market use CHVRS alone. ====In Québec==== [[Image:quebecrating-G.png|60px]][[Image:quebecrating-13.png|60px]][[Image:quebecrating-16.png|60px]][[Image:quebecrating-18.png|60px]] In Québec, the ''Régie du cinéma'' ratings apply to home video products. Sticker rating labels must be provided by the distributor, and displayed on rental material. The ratings are as follows: * '''G''' Suitable for all. Violence is allowed but it must be in a fantasy context and non-explicit. If there is any swearing it must be appropriate for younger children. Sexual content must be kept to an extreme minimum. Horror elements may be present but only
