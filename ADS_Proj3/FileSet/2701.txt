University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.<ref name="archiveTractatus"/> This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.<ref>For example, Ramsey translated "''Sachverhalt''" and "''Sachlage''" as "atomic fact" and "state of affairs" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent "''Sachverhalten''," and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating "''Sachverhalt''" as "state of affairs" and "''Sachlage''" as "situation." The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness.

Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully, and therefore the limits of what can be thought. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of thought. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable, and by implication the unthinkable: "what can we say at all can be said clearly," he argues. Anything beyond that&mdash;religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical&mdash;cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.<ref name=Grayling16>Grayling, A.C. ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction''.

If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me," he told Ogden&mdash;and presents seven numbered propositions (1&ndash;7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):<ref>For the comment to Ogden, see Monk, p. 207.</ref> #''Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist''. #:The world is all that is the case.<ref>The English is from the 1961 Pears-McGuinness translation.</ref> # ''Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten''. #:What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs. # ''Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke''. #:A logical picture of facts is a thought. # ''Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz''. #:A thought is a proposition with a sense. # ''Der Satz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion der Elementarsätze''. #:A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. #''Die allgemeine Form der Wahrheitsfunktion ist: <math>[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]</math>.

In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in the Schneeberg mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were one-quarter animal and three-quarters human. He was miserable. He had no one he could discuss philosophy with, which was particularly frustrating given that the ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate in Cambridge and among the [[Vienna Circle]].<ref name=Monk212/> Frank Ramsey arrived to visit him on 17 September 1923 to discuss the ''Tractatus''; he had agreed to write a review of it for ''Mind''.<ref name=Monk212>Monk, pp. 212, 214&ndash;216, 220&ndash;221.</ref> He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.<ref>Mellor, D.H.

Ramsey"], Philosophy 70, 1995, pp. 243&ndash;262.</ref> After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.<ref name=Monk212/> Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes: "[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned
