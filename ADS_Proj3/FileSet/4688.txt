[[Category:Quantum chemistry]] [[Category:Quantum Monte Carlo]] [[Category:Mathematical optimization]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39245</id> <title>Variational inequality</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], a '''variational inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] involving a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]], which has to be [[Inequality (mathematics)#Solving Inequalities|solved]] for all the [[value (mathematics)|value]] of a given [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], belonging usually to a [[convex set]]. The [[mathematical]] [[theory]] of variational inequalities was initially developed to deal with [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems, precisely the [[Signorini problem]]: in that model problem, the functional involved was obtained as the [[first variation]] of the involved [[Signorini_problem#The_potential_energy|potential energy]] therefore it has a [[Calculus of variation|variational origin]], recalled by the name of the general abstract problem. The applicability of the theory has since been expanded to include problems from [[economics]], [[finance]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[game theory]]. == History == The first problem involving a variational inequality was the [[Signorini problem]], posed by [[Antonio Signorini]] in 1959 and solved by [[Gaetano Fichera]] in 1963, according to the references {{Harv|Antman|1983|pp=282â€“284}} and {{Harv|Fichera|1995}}: the first papers of the theory were {{Harv|Fichera|1963}} and {{Harv|Fichera|1964a}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1964b}}. Later on [[Guido Stampacchia]] proved his generalization to the [[Lax-Milgram theorem]] in {{Harv|Stampacchia|1964}} in order to study the [[regularity problem]] for [[partial differential equation]]s and [[coin]]ed the name "variational inequality" for all the problems involving [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] of this kind. [[Georges Duvaut]] encouraged his [[graduate student]]s to study and expand on Fichera's work, after attending a conference in [[Brixen]] on 1965 where Fichera presented his study of the Signorini problem, as {{Harvnb|Antman|1983|p=283}} reports: thus the theory become widely known throughout [[France]]. Also in 1965, Stampacchia and [[Jacques-Louis Lions]] extended earlier results of {{Harv|Stampacchia|1964}}, announcing them in the paper {{Harv|Lions|Stampacchia|1965}}: full proofs of their results appeared later in the paper {{Harv|Lions|Stampacchia|1967}}. == Definition == Following {{Harvtxt|Antman|1983|p=283}}, the formal definition of a variational inequality is the following one. {{EquationRef|1|Definition 1.}} Given a [[Banach space]] '''<math>E</math>''', a [[subset]] '''<math>K</math>''' of '''<math>E</math>''', and a [[functional]] <math>\scriptstyle F:\boldsymbol{K}\rightarrow\boldsymbol{E}^\ast</math> from '''<math>K</math>''' to the [[dual space]] '''<math>E^*</math>''' of the space '''<math>E</math>''', the variational inequality problem is the problem of [[Inequality (mathematics)#Solving Inequalities|solving]] respect to the [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] ''<math>x</math>'' belonging to '''<math>K</math>''' the following [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]: :<math>\langle F(x), y-x \rangle \geq 0\qquad\forall y \in \boldsymbol{K}</math> where <math>\scriptstyle\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle: \boldsymbol{E}^*\times\boldsymbol{E}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}</math> is the [[Dual space|duality pairing]]. In general, the variational inequality problem can be formulated on any [[Finite set|finite]]- or [[Infinite set|infinite]]-[[dimension]]al [[Banach space]]. The three obvious steps in the study of the problem are the following ones: #Prove the existence of a solution: this step implies the ''mathematical correctness'' of the problem, showing that there is at least a solution. #Prove the uniqueness of the given solution: this step implies the ''physical correctness'' of the problem, showing that the solution can be used to represent a physical phenomenon. It is a particularly important step since most of the problems modeled by variational inequalities are of physical origin. #Find the solution. ==Examples== ===The problem of finding the minimal value of a real-valued function of real variable=== This is a standard example problem, reported by {{Harvtxt|Antman|1983|p=283}}: consider the problem of finding the [[minimum|minimal value]] of a [[differentiable function]] <math>f</math> over a [[closed interval]] <math>I = [a,b]</math>. Let <math>\scriptstyle x^*</math> be a point in ''<math>I</math>'' where the minimum occurs. Three cases can occur: # if <math>\scriptstyle a<x^*< b</math> then <math>\scriptstyle f'(x^*) = 0;</math> # if <math>\scriptstyle x^*=a</math> then <math>\scriptstyle f'(x^*) \ge 0;</math> # if <math>\scriptstyle x^*=b</math> then <math>\scriptstyle f'(x^*) \le 0.</math> These necessary conditions can be summarized as the problem of finding <math>\scriptstyle x^*\in I</math> such that :<math>f'(x^*)(y-x^*) \geq 0\qquad\forall y \in I</math> The absolute minimum must be searched between the solutions (if more than one) of the preceding [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]: note that the solution is a [[real number]], therefore this is a finite [[Dimension (mathematics)|dimensional]] variational inequality. ===The general finite dimensional variational inequality=== A formulation of the general problem in <math>\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n</math> is the following: given a [[subset]] <math>K</math> of <math>\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n</math> and a [[mapping]] <math>\scriptstyle F:K\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the [[Finite set|finite]]-[[dimension]]al variational inequality problem associated with <math>K</math> consist of finding a [[Dimension|<math>n</math>-dimensional]] [[Euclidean vector|vector]] <math>x</math> belonging to <math>K</math> such that :<math>\langle F(x), y-x \rangle \geq 0\qquad\forall y \in K</math> where <math>\scriptstyle\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}</math> is the standard [[inner product]] on the [[vector space]] <math>\scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n</math>. === The variational inequality for the Signorini problem === [[Image:Classical Signorini problem.svg|thumb|right|400px|The classical [[Signorini problem]]: what will be the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|equilibrium]] [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|configuration]] of the orange spherically shaped [[Physical body|elastic body]] resting on the blue [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[friction]]less [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]?]] In the historical survey {{Harv|Fichera|1995}}, [[Gaetano Fichera]] describes the genesis of his solution to the [[Signorini problem]]: the problem consist in finding the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|elastic equilibrium]] [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|configuration]] <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(u_1(\boldsymbol{x}),u_2(\boldsymbol{x}),u_3(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math> of a [[Anisotropy#Material science and engineering|anisotropic]] [[Homogeneous media|non-homogeneous]] [[Physical body|elastic body]] that lies in a [[subset]] <math>A</math> of the three-[[dimension]]al [[euclidean space]] whose [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] is <math>\scriptstyle\partial A</math>, resting on a [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[frictionless]] [[surface]] and subject only to its [[Weight|mass force]]s. The solution '''<math>u</math>''' of the problem exists and is unique (under precise assumptions) in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of '''admissible displacements''' <math>\scriptstyle\mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math> i.e. the set of [[displacement vector]]s satisfying the system of [[Signorini problem#The
