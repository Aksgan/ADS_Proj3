Although distributed objects, and CORBA in particular, were the 'next big thing' in the early 1990s, by the second half of the decade interest in them had essentially disappeared. Web-based applications running entirely on the server became the new 'next big thing', and the need for a powerful display system on the client-side was simply dropped and replaced by lightweight GUIs based on [[HTML]]. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{cite journal | quotes = | last = Shah | first = Rawn | date = June 1, 1996 | title = Distributed Object Computing with Joe and NEO | journal = JavaWorld | url = http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-1996/jw-06-exceptions.html | accessdate = 2006-12-13 }} [[Category:CORBA]] [[Category:Object-oriented programming]] [[Category:Application programming interfaces]] [[Category:Sun Microsystems software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10769</id> <title>Distributed Proofreaders</title> <text>[[Image:Pgdp-logo.pngâ€Ž|right||Official logo for Distributed Proofreaders]] [[Image:Distributed Proofreaders proofreading interface.png|right|360px|Screenshot of the proofreading interface on Distributed Proofreaders.]] '''Distributed Proofreaders''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DP''' or '''PGDP''') is a web-based project that supports the development of [[e-text]]s for [[Project Gutenberg]] by allowing many people to work together in [[proofreading]] drafts of e-texts for errors. == History == Distributed Proofreaders was founded by Charles Franks in 2000 as an independent site to assist Project Gutenberg. Distributed Proofreaders became an official Project Gutenberg site in 2002. On 8 November 2002, Distributed Proofreaders was [[Slashdot effect|slashdotted]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Volunteers%27_Voices#Suzanne_Shell|title=Gutenberg:Volunteers' Voices|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2002/11/12/distributed-proofrea.html|title=Distributed Proofreading's slashdotting|publisher=[[Boingboing]]}}</ref> and more than 4,000 new members joined in one day, causing an influx of new proofreaders and software developers, which helped to greatly increase the quantity and quality of e-text production. Distributed Proofreaders posted their 5,000th text to Project Gutenberg in October 2004, in March 2007, the 10,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg and in May 2009, the 15,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg. DP-contributed e-texts comprised almost half of works in Project Gutenberg. On 31 July, 2006, the Distributed Proofreaders Foundation was formed to provide Distributed Proofreaders with its own legal entity and [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] status. [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] approval of section [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] status was granted retroactive to 7 April, 2006. == Proofreading process == [[Public domain]] works, typically books with expired copyright, are scanned by volunteers or culled from digitalization projects, and the images are run through [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) [[software]]. Since OCR software is far from perfect, often a large number of errors appear in the resulting text. To correct them, pages are made available to volunteers via the Internet; the original page image and the recognized text appear side by side. This process thereby distributes the time-consuming error-correction process, akin to [[distributed computing]]. Each page is proofread and formatted many times, and then a post-processor combines the pages and prepares the text for uploading to Project Gutenberg. Besides custom software created to support the project, DP also runs a forum and a wiki for project coordinators and participants. == Related Projects == === DP Europe === In January 2004, Distributed Proofreaders Europe started, hosted by [[Project Rastko]]. This site has the ability to process text in [[Unicode]] [[UTF-8]] encoding. Books proofread are centered mainly on European culture, with a large proportion of non-English texts including Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu and many others. {{As of|2007|alt=As of December 2007}}, DP Europe had produced over 480 e-texts. The original DP is sometimes referred to as "DP International" by members of DP Europe. However, DP servers are located in the [[United States]], and therefore works must be cleared by Project Gutenberg as being in the [[public domain]] according to U.S. [[copyright]] law before they can be proofread and eventually published at DP. === DP Canada === On 1 December 2007, [[Distributed Proofreaders Canada]] launched to support the production of e-books for [[Project Gutenberg Canada]] and take advantage of shorter Canadian [[copyright]] terms. Although it was established by members of the original Distributed Proofreaders site, it is a separate entity. All of its projects are posted to Project Gutenberg Canada, which launched on [[Canada Day]] 2007. In addition to preserving Canadiana, DP Canada is notable because it is the first major effort to take advantage of Canada's copyright laws which may allow more works to be preserved. Like copyright law in many other countries, Canada has a "life plus 50" copyright term. This means that works by authors who died more than fifty years ago may be preserved in Canada, whereas in other parts of the world those works may not be distributed because they are still copyright. Notable authors whose works may be preserved in Canada but not other parts of the world include [[A. A. Milne]], [[Walter de la Mare]], [[Sheila Kaye-Smith]] and [[Amy Carmichael]]. == Milestones == {| class="wikitable" |----- ! Milestone ! Date ! e-text !
