develop increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion, when compared to ordinary steel, by forming a protective oxide coating, having a uniform deep brown color and texture. Eero Saarinen experimented with the material in the Deere and Company building in 1964. ===Aluminum=== Aluminum was not available at a reasonable price or in sufficient quantities for general architectural use until after the beginning of the 20th century. Architectural use of aluminum increased in the 1920s, mainly for decorative detailing. It was used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, wall panels, and spandrels. Art Deco designs frequently used aluminum for ornamental features. The first extensive use of aluminum in construction was the Empire State Building, where the entire tower portion is aluminum, as well as many decorative features, such as the entrances, elevator doors, ornamental trim, and some 6,000 window spandrels. Today, aluminum is used frequently in construction except major structural members.<ref>Gayle, Margot and Waite, John G.

Architectural theory is taught in most architecture schools and is practiced by the world's leading [[architect]]s. Some forms that architecture theory takes are the [[lecture]] or dialogue, the treatise or book, and the paper project or [[architectural design competition|competition entry]]. Architectural theory is often didactic, and theorists tend to stay close to or work from within schools. It has existed in some form since [[ancient history|antiquity]], and as publishing became more common, architectural theory gained an increased richness. Books, magazines, and journals published an unprecedented amount of works by architects and critics in the 20th century. As a result, styles and movements formed and dissolved much more quickly than the relatively enduring modes in earlier history. It is to be expected that the use of the internet will further the discourse on architecture in the twenty 1st century. ==History== ===Antiquity=== There is little information or evidence about major architectural theory in antiquity, until the 1st century BCE, with the work of [[Vitruvius]]. This does not mean, however, that such works did not exist. Many works never survived antiquity, and the burning of the [[Alexandria Library]] shows us a very good example of this. Vitruvius was a Roman [[writer]], [[architect]] and [[engineer]], active in the 1st century BCE. He was the most prominent architectural theorist in the Roman Empire known today, having written ''[[De architectura]]'', known today as ''The Ten Books of Architecture'', a treatise written of [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] on architecture, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. It is the only surviving major book on architecture from classical antiquity. Probably written between 27 and 23 BCE,<ref>Kruft, p.447.</ref> it is the only contemporary source on classical architecture to have survived. Divided into ten sections or "books", it covers almost every aspect of Roman architecture, from town planning, materials, decorations, temples, water supplies, etc. The famous [[orders of architecture]] that we can see in every classical architecture are rigorously defined in the books. It also gathers three fundamental laws that [[Architecture]] must obey, in order to be so considered: ''firmitas, utilitas, venustas'': firmness, commodity (in the sense of functionality), and delight. The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the Renaissance, prompting the rise of the [[Renaissance]] style. Renaissance architects, such as Niccoli, Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti, found in "De Architectura" their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a scientific discipline. ===Middle Ages=== {{Expand section|date=June 2008}} Throughout the Middle Ages, architectural knowledge was passed by transcription, word of mouth and technically in master builders' lodges.<ref>Evers, Thoenes, et al., p.13.</ref> Due to the laborious nature of transcription, few examples of architectural theory were penned in this time period. Most works that from this period were theological, and were transcriptions of the bible, so the architectural theories were the notes on structures included therein. The [[Abbot Suger]]'s ''Liber de rebus in administratione sua gestis'', was an architectural document that emerged with [[gothic architecture]]. Another was [[Villard de Honnecourt]]'s portfolio of drawings from about the 1230s. In [[Song Dynasty]] China, Li Jie published the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' in 1103, which was an architectural treatise that codified elements of [[Chinese architecture]].<ref>Liang Ssu-ch'eng.

ISBN 0300095597</ref> ===Renaissance=== {{Expand section|date=June 2008}} The first great work of architectural theory of this period belongs to [[Leon Battista Alberti]], ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', which placed Vitruvius at the core of the most profound theoretical tradition of the modern ages. From Alberti, good architecture is validated through the Vitruvian triad, which defines its purpose. This triplet conserved all its validity until the 19th century. ===Enlightenment=== {{Expand section|date=June 2008}} The Age of the Enlightenment witnessed considerable development in architectural theory on the European continent. New archeological discoveries (such as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum) drove new interest in Classical art and architecture. Thus the term Neoclassicism (exemplified by the writings of Prussian art critic Johann Joachim Winkelmann) arose to designate 18th-century architecture which looked to these new Classical precedents for inspiration in building design.<ref>Robin Middleton and David Watkin, Neoclassicism and 19th-Century Architecture. The MIT Press, 1980 and Barry Bergdoll, European Architecture 1750–1890, Oxford University Press, 2000.l,</ref> Major architectural theorists of the Enlightenment include Julien-David Leroy, Abbé Marc-Antoine Laugier, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Robert Adam, James Stuart, and Nicholas Revett. [[Georg Friedrich Hegel]] also had a significant impact on architectural theory.<ref>[[Mark Jarzombek]], *[http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/footprint1.pdf "The Cunning
