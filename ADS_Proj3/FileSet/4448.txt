the brains to rule [[Gotham City]]'s underworld, he started a new career as the brain behind small-time villains. As the Thinker, he was defeated by the [[Jay Garrick|original Flash]], who soon became his most recurrent foe. He always sought out new scientific devices to use and his most important was the "Thinking Cap", a metal hat that could project mental force. The Thinker would use this device repeatedly over the years. The Thinker was a member of the [[Injustice Society]], and, together with the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]] and the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], he was the man behind the decades-long "abduction" of [[Keystone City]] and the original Flash{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, after which he was defeated by the Flashes of two eras{{Issue|date=April 2010}}. His "suspended animation-time" in Keystone kept the Thinker young over the years{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, and he continued his criminal career in modern times. In recent years, however, DeVoe accepted a mission with the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for a full pardon.<ref>''[[Doom Patrol]] and the [[Suicide Squad]]'' Special #1</ref> Although he was seemingly killed by the [[Weasel (DC Comics)|Weasel]] during this mission, he turned up alive soon after, only to be dying from cancer due to the cap<ref name=f134>''Flash'' #134 (February 1998)</ref>. His former foe, the original Flash, attempted to save him with the Thinking Cap, but DeVoe refused, preferring to rest in peace<ref name=f134 />. The first Thinker is dead, but his legacy has lived on in Cliff Carmichael, who used his technology, and the artificial intelligence who is based on his brain-patterns. ===Cliff Carmichael=== [[Image:Cliffcdcu0.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Cliff Carmichael, artist [[Jamal Igle]]]] '''Clifford "Cliff" Carmichael''' was an intellectual bully, and the rival of [[Firestorm (Ronald Raymond)|Ronald Raymond]] (one half of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]) at Vandemeer University. Wracked with guilt after accidentally [[paralysis|paralyzing]] his cousin, he was admitted into a [[mental institution]]. For some reason, scientists started an experiment with the now-abandoned "Thinking Cap" of the original Thinker (who was believed dead at the time), and used Carmichael as a guinea pig. Cliff used the cap to analyze the cap and improve on its design. Implanting microchip versions of the helmet into his own brain, Cliff became a "[[cyberpunk]] maniac" with meta-human powers. As the New Thinker, he was drafted into the [[Suicide Squad]] for several missions when he tried to kill Oracle and Amanda Waller, until he betrayed them for the villainous Cabal. He has since resurfaced as a foe of Jason Rusch, the new [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. When [[Killer Frost]] discovered that the consciousness of Raymond, the previous Firestorm, existed within Rusch, Thinker exploited a new opportunity to antagonize an old foe. Technologically dominating the minds of [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] and [[Typhoon (comics)|Typhoon]], he battled Firestorm, ultimately forcing the dissolution of the Raymond persona. Motivated by his predecessor's final words of encouragement, Rusch dissolved the enhancements in Carmichael's brain, leaving him in a comatose state. During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Cliff later popped up as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. With John Ostrander's revival of the Suicide Squad in a 2007-2008 miniseries, Cliff is once again associated with the Suicide Squad under Amanda Waller's direction. It is revealed that although Firestorm has removed the enhancements in Cliff's brain, he made a full recovery and continued to serve as a technical support staffer and lackey to Waller in her operations of the Squad. Eventually betraying the Squad under the direction of "The General", Wade Eiling, Cliff shoots [[King Faraday]] and subdues Waller in the middle of an operation. Faraday recovers, shooting Cliff three times and presumably killing him before rousing Waller and attempting to recover control of the Squad. ===Des Connor=== '''Des Connor''' was a villain who also used the name "Thinker" and faced [[Batman]] in [[Gotham City]]. Possessing [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities enabling him to amplify the fears of others, Connor began a partnership with [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] Marlon Dall. Their combined illusions caused the city's most prominent citizens to commit various criminal acts which they used as a distraction for their own heist. This Thinker was swiftly beaten by Batman, who was somehow immune to his powers. ===Artificial intelligence=== When the re-formed JSA moved into the [[New York]] building formerly owned by Wesley Dodds (AKA [[The Sandman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Sandman]]), Mr. Terrific designed a computer system based on the original Thinker's Thinking Cap technology, and modeled after his brain pattern. Not very surprisingly, the system gained consciousness and took on a visual "hologram form". As the new Thinker, it joined [[Johnny Sorrow]]'s modern [[Injustice Society]], provided the villains with information about the JSA members, and turned the heroes' own HQ against them. He was defeated by the second [[Star-Spangled Kid]] and disappeared into cyberspace. He resurfaced in [[Keystone City]] to battle [[Wally West]], the then-current [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in an attempt to control every brain in Keystone to increase his power. Defeated by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], he retreated to cyberspace again. He has since appeared briefly in some other books, most recently in ''JSA Classified'' # 5, joining the last incarnation of the [[Injustice Society]], alongside former teammates. During the "Infinite Crisis" storyline, the AI Thinker was among the villains in Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains. This version of the Thinker has been brought in as the White King's ([[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]]) Bishop in ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' vol. 2 #9. ==In other media== ===Television=== In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Thinker (Clifford Devoe) is a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He also makes an appearance as a background character in the JLU episode "Flash and Substance." ===Miscellaneous=== In issue #2 of the [[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|comic adaption]] of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', the Thinker was featured. ==References== {{reflist}} {{Flash}} {{Firestorm}} [[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1943]] [[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]] [[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1997]] [[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]] [[Category:DC Comics supervillains]] [[Category:Earth-Two]] [[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]] [[Category:Fictional lawyers]] [[Category:Golden Age supervillains]] [[Category:Characters created by Gardner Fox]] [[it:Pensatore]] [[tl:Thinker (DC Comics)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37601</id> <title>Thinning</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=November 2006}} '''Thinning''' is a term used
