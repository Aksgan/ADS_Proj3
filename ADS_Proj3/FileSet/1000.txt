a high standard was reached on this; an emergency priority signal consisting of a long crib with crib and message text repeated as a safeguard against corruption would take under an hour from the time we began to write the signal out in Hut 8 to the completion of its decyphering in Op. 20 G. As a result of this we were able to use the Op. 20 G bombes almost as conveniently as if they had been at one of our outstations 20 or 30 miles away.<ref>Alexander (''c.'' 1945) Ch. VIII para. 11</ref> }} The US Army also produced a bombe. It was physically very different from the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with [[Bell Labs]] on 30 September 1942.<ref>Sebag-Montefiore (2004) p. 254</ref> The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not.<ref Name=WelchmanP135/><ref name=WengerWilcoxP52 /> The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately {{convert|7|ft|m}} long {{convert|8|ft|m}} high and {{convert|6|in|mm}} wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons.<ref Name=WengerWilcoxP51 >Wenger (1945) p. 51</ref> A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.<ref Name=WengerWilcoxP52 >Wenger (1945) p. 52</ref> ===German suspicions=== By 1945, almost all German Enigma traffic ([[Wehrmacht]], [[Kriegsmarine]], [[Luftwaffe]], [[Abwehr]], [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], etc.) could be decrypted within a day or two, yet the Germans remained confident of its security.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} They openly discussed their plans and movements, handing the Allies huge amounts of information, not all of which was used effectively. For example, Rommel's actions at the [[Kasserine Pass]] were clearly foreshadowed in decrypted Enigma traffic, but the information was not properly appreciated by the Americans. Some information was also not acted upon on purpose, so as not to betray that the code was broken.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} After the war, American [[TICOM]] project teams found and detained a considerable number of German cryptographic personnel. Among the things the Americans learned was that German cryptographers, at least, understood very well that Enigma messages might be read; they knew Enigma was not unbreakable. They just found it impossible to imagine anyone going to the immense effort required.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bamford | first = James | author-link = James Bamford | year = 2001 | title = Body Of Secrets: How America's NSA & Britain's GCHQ Eavesdrop on the World | publisher = Century | page = 17 | isbn = 978-0712675987 }}</ref> When [[Abwehr]] personnel who had worked on [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish cryptography]] and Russian traffic were interned at Rosenheim around May 1945, they were not at all surprised that Enigma had been broken, only that someone had mustered all the resources in time to actually do it.
