technology to run two 6600-series [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]]. Due to technical issues with compatibility, at release the card was supported by only one of Gigabyte's own motherboards, with which it was bundled. Later came the GV-3D1-68GT, functionally similar and possessing similarly-limited motherboard compatibility, but with 6800 GPUs in place of the GV-3D1's 6600 units. Around March 2006, [[ASUS]] released the ''N7800GT Dual''. Similar to Gigabyte's design, it had two 7800GT GPUs mounted on one video card. Again, this faced several issues, such as pricing (it retailed for around US$800, while two separate 7800GTs were cheaper at the time), limited release, and limited compatibility. It would only be supported on the [[nForce4]] chipset and only a few nForce4 chipset-based motherboards could actually utilize it. It was also one of the first video cards with the option to use an external [[power supply]] if needed.<ref name="maximumpc">{{cite news | url=http://www.maximumpc.com/2006/02/asus_n7800gt_du.html | title=Asus N7800GT Dual | publisher=[[Maximum PC]] | first=Michael | last=Brown | date=2006-02-17 | accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref> In January 2006, NVIDIA released the 7900 GX2, their own attempt at a dual-GPU card. Effectively, this product is a pair of slightly lower clocked 7900GTX cards "bridged" together into one discrete unit, with separate frame buffers for both GPUs (512MB of GDDR3 each). The GeForce 7900 GX2 is only available to OEM companies for inclusion in quad-GPU systems, and it cannot be bought in the consumer market. The [[Dell XPS]], announced at the 2006 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], used two 7900 GX2's to build a quad-GPU system. Later, [[Alienware]] acquired the technology in March. The official implementations of dual-GPU graphics cards work in the same fashion. Two GPUs are placed on two separate printed circuit boards ([[printed circuit board|PCBs]]), with their own power circuitry and memory. Both boards have slim coolers, cooling the GPU and memory. The 'primary' GPU can be considered to be the one on the rear board, or 'top' board (being on top when in a standard ATX system). The primary board has a physical PCIe x16 connector, and the other has a round gap in it to provide cooling for the primary HSF. Both boards are connected to each other by two physical links; one for 16 PCI-Express lanes, and one for the 400 MHz SLI bridge. An onboard PCI-Express bridge chip, with 48 lanes in total, acts as the MCP does in SLI motherboards, connecting to both GPUs and the physical PCI-Express slot, removing the need for the motherboard to support SLI. A newer version, the [[GeForce 7 Series#GeForce 7950 GX2|GeForce 7950 GX2]], which addressed many issues in the 7900 GX2, was available to consumers for separate purchase. The [[GeForce 9 Series#GeForce 9800|GeForce 9800 GX2]] was NVIDIA's next attempt at a multi-GPU solution released in March 2008, this time using separate PCBs facing each other, thus sharing one large double wide cooling fan. This GX2 could expand to a total of four GPUs when paired in SLI. The 9800 GX2 was concurrent with the launch of a single-GPU 65 nm 9800 GTX. Three months later, with the 9800 GX2 selling at $299, NVIDIA found their product line competing with itself, as the GTX 260 and the 55 nm improved 9800 GTX+ became available, NVIDIA elected to venture into the GTX200 series and beyond lineups, rather than expanding the 55 nm G92 into a GX2 form factor, thus leaving mid-range audiences with the options of the 9800 GT and 9800 GTX+. On January 2009, the new GTX200 series based GeForce GTX 295 was released. It combines two 55 nm GeForce GTX 275 GPUs underclocked, with a similar sandwich design of two graphics PCBs facing each other with a large double wide cooling fan solution in-between, but with all the GDDR3 RAM modules on the same half of each board as each corresponding GPU; a feature that neither the initial GTX200 boards nor the 9800 GX2 board had. It manages to maintain the same amount of shaders as the GTX 280/285 bringing it to a total of 480 shader units. A second version of the GTX295 has been produced, this time using a single PCB and a dual slot cooler. ===Quad SLI=== {{Update|date=September 2007}}<!-- missing current graphics cards (as of 2007: 8600/8800) --> In early 2006, NVIDIA revealed its plans for Quad SLI. When the 7900GX2 was originally demonstrated, it was with two such cards in a SLI configuration. This is possible because each GX2 has two extra SLI connectors, separate from the bridges used to link the two GPU's in one unit â€“ one on each PCB, two per GPU, for a total of two links per GPU. When two GX2 graphics cards are installed in a SLI motherboard, these SLI connectors are bridged using two separate SLI bridges. (In such a configuration, if the four PCBs were labeled A, B, C, D from top to bottom, A and C would be linked by an SLI bridge, as would B and D.) This way, four GPUs can contribute to performance. The 7950GX2, sold as an enthusiast-friendly card, omits the external SLI connector on one of its PCBs, meaning that only one SLI bridge is required to run two 7950GX2s in SLI. Quad SLI did not show any massive improvements in gaming using the common resolutions of [[SXGA|1280x1024]] and [[UXGA|1600x1200]], but has shown improvements by enabling [[Anti-Aliasing|32x anti-aliasing]] in SLI-AA mode, and support for [[QXGA|2560x1600]] resolutions at much higher [[framerate]]s than is possible with single or dual GPU systems with maximum settings in modern games. It was believed that high latencies severely marginalized the benefits of four GPUs, however much of the blame for poor performance scaling is due to Windows XP's API which only allows for a maximum storage of 3 extra frames. Windows Vista and Windows 7 are not limited in this fashion and shows promise for future multi-GPU configurations. In March 2008, NVIDIA released the GeForce 9800 GX2 GPU. Targeted at high-end gaming, the 9800 GX2 is essentially two updated and slightly underclocked G92 8800GTS cores on a dual-PCB graphics card to
