Its focus is research into the [[Semantic Web]] and [[Web Science]]. It was established as a ''Centre for Science, Engineering and Technology (CSET)'' in 2003 with funding from [[Science Foundation Ireland]]. Additional funding sources are [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|EU Framework Programs]], [[Enterprise Ireland]], and private companies. Besides the main institute in [[Galway]], DERI has annexes at [[Stanford University]], California, USA and at [[Seoul National University]]. ==Memberships== DERI is a [[W3C]] member organization<ref>http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List</ref> and a founding member of the [[Web Science Trust]] Network<ref>http://webscience.org/WSTNet.html</ref>. ==Links== * [http://www.deri.ie/ Official website] * [http://www.deri.org/ DERI International] ==References== {{Reflist}} * [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/sunday_times_university_guide/article6840191.ece Galway takes on presidential look: Strong research at NUI Galway has reached as far as Barack Obama using one of its web systems] Colm Murphy.

Also known as '''DEC''' <ref>"DEC used by Digital itself:" ''PDP11 Processor Handbook'' (1973): page 8, "DEC, PDP, UNIBUS are registered trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation;" page 1-4, "Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) designs and manufactures many of the peripheral devices offered with [[PDP-11]]'s. As a designer and manufacturer of peripherals, DEC can offer extremely reliable equipment... The LA30 DECwriter, a totally DEC-designed and built teleprinter, can serve as an alternative to the Teletype."</ref> and using the trademark '''DIGITAL''', its [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] and [[VAX]] products were arguably the most popular [[minicomputer]]s for the scientific and engineering communities during the 1970s and 1980s. From 1957 until 1992 its headquarters was located in an old wool mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], which subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] in May 2002. Digital Equipment Corporation should not be confused with the unrelated companies [[Digital Research|Digital Research, Inc]] or [[Western Digital]] (despite the latter manufacturing the [[LSI-11]] chipsets used in DEC's low end [[PDP-11]]/03 computers). ==Overview== Initially focusing on the small-end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the [[PDP-8]], widely considered to be the first successful [[minicomputer]]. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the [[PDP-11]] in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DECs position in the industry. Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's [[VAX|VAX-11]] series was the first widely-used [[32-bit]] minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "[[Superminicomputer|superminis]]". These were able to compete in many roles with larger [[mainframe computer]]s, such as the [[IBM System/370]]. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the state government. The rapid rise of the business [[microcomputer]] in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly-changing market was the [[DEC Alpha]] [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] [[processor architecture]]. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance [[workstations]]. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, it did little to affect the bottom line or repair the company's status. The company was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] in May 2002. {{As of|2007}} some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name. ==History== ===Origins=== [[Ken Olsen]] and [[Harlan Anderson]] were two engineers who had been working at [[MIT]] [[Lincoln Laboratory]] on the lab's various computer projects. The Lab is best known for their work on what would today be known as "interactivity", and their machines were among the
