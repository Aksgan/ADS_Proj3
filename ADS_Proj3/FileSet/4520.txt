Barris's other music used on previous game shows, such as the unsold pilot for ''Cop-Out!'', was recycled in order to save money; this was a common practice among packagers in the 1970s. ===Gameplay=== ====Contestant selection==== Before taping began, production staff gave 10 female members of the studio [[audience]] small gift boxes. Three of these boxes contained cards with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 inside them. As host Edwards instructed them to open their boxes, the three contestants with numbers came down to the table at the center of the stage. These three women then picked one of three [[jack-in-the-box]]es, the contestant with the number 1 getting first choice, and so on. The one who chose the pop-up surprise (e.g., flowers, dolls) earned the right to go on the Treasure Hunt. Unlike the original 1950s version, the show did not use a question-and-answer method of determining contestants; ''The New Treasure Hunt'' did not require special skills or knowledge at all, with contestants relying entirely on luck. ====The Treasure Hunt==== After being shown two or three of some of the prizes hidden among the 30 packages, the contestant was asked to select one of the boxes, which one of the models would then bring down to the table. Once the box was chosen, and after a commercial break, the contestant had the option of taking a [[cash]] payoff (ranging from $500 to $2,000 originally; later in the run, up to $2,500), or keeping the box instead and winning whatever was inside. Possible prizes included a package of several items, vacations, [[automobile]]s, checks for anywhere between $5,000 and $14,000, or [[booby prize]]s in which Edwards nicknamed "klunks". One box contained a check for the grand prize of $25,000. ====Skits==== Upon making her selection, the contestant was not shown what she had won immediately; like most of the other Barris-packaged shows, the entire premise of this show was to display (and exploit) the female contestants' emotions. Host Edwards would engage the contestant in a comedic [[sketch comedy|skit]], usually using props, to intentionally mislead the contestant as to what she had finally won. Very often, a contestant would be shown a "klunk", only to have this lead to the actual prize, which could be just another klunk, but was often much bigger. Producers had to devise nearly 30 skits per episode (66 on the 1980s version). Due to the lack of cue cards, the taping would be stopped after a box was chosen so that Edwards could be briefed on what he was supposed to do. Aside from his hosting and radio work, Edwards was also an actor and the producers encouraged him to build the tension as he saw fit, even to unbearable levels. The only time no skit took place was when the contestant won the grand prize. The common method of the reveal would entail Edwards suggesting to the contestant she should have kept the money in the envelope, before revealing that "all you have ... here (or "what you have won") ... is TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!" Hysterics occurred following the revealing of the check; shrill sirens went off, confetti and balloons dropped from the ceiling, and, on a few occasions late in the run, the contestant was swarmed onstage by Barris staff members and humorously given roses. The show sometimes played the sirens so loud the audience could not be heard over the noise. Two games were played per show, each involving one half of the studio audience (the two halves faced each other, similar to seating at a sporting event, and unlike most conventional television studios). If the contestant found the check during the first half of the show, another was hidden for the second half. ===Grand prize reveal=== At the end of each episode, if the top prize was not won, Edwards ritually asked Emile Autouri, a bonded security guard, if he hid the check, to which Autouri's response would always be "Yes, I did". Autouri would then hand Edwards a slip of paper with the correct box number before retrieving the box which contained the grand prize. In an ongoing gag, Edwards would occasionally attempt to converse with Autouri before the reveal; however, Autouri always remained completely silent. ==1980s version (''Treasure Hunt'')== ''The New Treasure Hunt'' returned in daily syndication in 1981, with Edwards again as host; however, there were some notable differences. First, the title was shortened to the original 1950s name, ''Treasure Hunt''. There were now 66 surprise packages on stage, and instead of a flat $25,000, a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] that started out at $20,000 and increased by $1,000 every day until won or until it reached $50,000, at which point it remained at that amount until it was claimed. After the first jackpot was won on the fourth show, the jackpot was eliminated and the top prize was changed to a flat $20,000 for a brief period on this version. However, the jackpot was later reinstated and won four times: $23,000; $20,000; $50,000 and $21,000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The model on the 1980s version was Jan Speck, who later had acting roles in various movies (many of which were directed by [[John Badham]], whom Speck married shortly after ''TH'' completed its run). Barris had no direct involvement in the 1981â€“82 version other than packaging it (he shared executive-producer credit with Budd Granoff this time around); by then, he spent much of the year in France. The show featured an entirely new closing theme by [[Milton DeLugg]] as well as the reuse of some of the music cues from the earlier version. ===Gameplay=== Again, two games were played per show, one with each half of the audience. In this version, the female members of the studio audience were given [[balloon]]s. One of these balloons contained a card with a star on it. On Edwards' cue, the contestants popped the balloons; the player with the star came down to center stage where she then faced the previous game's winner. There were now only two jack-in-the-boxes, with the
