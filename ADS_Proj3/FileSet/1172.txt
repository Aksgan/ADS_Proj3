The problem is not limited to text documents, but applies equally to photos, video, audio and other kinds of [[electronic document]]s. The concern leading to the use of the term is that documents are stored on physical [[Digital media|media]] which require special [[Computer hardware|hardware]] in order to be read and that this hardware will not be available in a few decades from the time the document was created. An example is that already today the necessary disk drive to read a 5¼-inch [[floppy disk]] is not readily available. The Digital Dark Age also applies to the problems which arise due to obsolete [[file format]]s. In this case it is the lack of the necessary [[software]] which causes problems when desiring to retrieve stored documents. A famous real example is with [[NASA]], whose early space records were suffering from a Dark Age issue: for over a decade, magnetic tapes from the 1976 Viking landings on Mars were unprocessed. When later analyzed, the data were unreadable as they were in an unknown format and the original programmers had either died or left NASA. The images were eventually extracted through many months of puzzling through the data and examining how the recording machines functioned.<ref>Sandra Blakeslee: [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DE1638F933A15750C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Lost on Earth: Wealth of Data Found in Space], New York Times, March 20, 1990</ref> Special mention should also be given to [[Encryption|encrypted]] data where the process needed to decode the data is intentionally made as obscure as possible. Historically encrypted data is quite rare but even the very simple means available throughout history have provided many examples of documents that can only be read with great effort. For example, it took the capacity of a distributed computing project to break the mechanically generated code of a single brief World War II submarine tactical message.<ref>Wearden, G.

This very widespread use of encryption closes down several of the routes (eg: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/missingepisodes.shtml Forgotten in the attic]) that the last few copies of documents and media that are later deemed to be historically significant can be recovered. == Prevention== In 2007, [[Microsoft]] created a partnership with [[The National Archives]] to prevent the digital dark age and "unlock millions of unreadable stored computer files."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/jul/04/news.uknews|title=National Archive project to avert digital dark age|last=Kennedy |first=Maev |date=Wednesday 4 July 2007 |work=News:Technology |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2007/gb2007075_877434.htm|title=Microsoft Helps Archives Save the Past|last=Ferguson |first=Tim |date=July 5, 2007|work=Technology|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3353826/How-to-stave-off-a-digital-dark-age.html|title=How to stave off a digital 'dark age'|last=Colvile|first=Robert |date=12:01AM BST 05 Jul 2007|work=Technology|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> The [[Internet Archive]] has stated that one of their goals is to prevent the digital dark age.<ref>[http://www.archive.org/about/about.php About the Internet Archive]</ref> == See also == * [[Digital Continuity]] * [[Digital obsolescence]] * [[Digital preservation]] * [[Digital amnesia]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * {{LISWiki_link|Digital Dark Ages}} * [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/21/tech/main537308.shtml Coming Soon A Digital Dark Age - CBS News] * [http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,871091,00.html How huge quantities of data are rapidly falling into a black hole - Guardian Unlimited] * [http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/the-digital-dark-age/2005/09/22/1126982184206.html The digital Dark Age - The Sydney Morning Herald] * [http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla63/63kuny1.pdf A Digital Dark Ages?

All photographs benefit from being developed. With film this could be done at the print lab, or an inexpensive home darkroom. With digital, many cameras are set up to do basic photo enhancement (contrast, color saturation) immediately after a picture is exposed, and to deliver a finished product. Higher end cameras, however, tend to give a flatter, more neutral image that has more data but less "pop," and needs to be developed in the digital darkroom. Setting up a film darkroom was primarily an issue of gathering the right chemicals and lighting; a digital darkroom consists of a powerful [[computer]], a high-quality monitor setup ([[dual-head|dual monitors]] are often used) and software. A printer is optional; many photographers still send their images to a professional lab for better results and, in some cases, a better price. While each implementation is unique, most share several traits: an image editing workstation like [[Photoshop]] or [[The Gimp]] as the cornerstone, often a [[database]]-driven [[digital asset management]] system to manage the collection as a whole, a RAW conversion tool, and in many cases
