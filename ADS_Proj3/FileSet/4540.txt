Many others followed. == Overview == TCG's original goal was the development of a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM), a [[semiconductor intellectual property core]] or [[integrated circuit]] that conforms to the trusted platform module specification put forward by the Trusted Computing Group and is to be included with computers to enable [[trusted computing]] features. TCG-compliant functionality has since been integrated directly into certain{{Specify|date=May 2008}} mass-market [[chipset]]s. TCG also recently released the first version of their [[Trusted Network Connect]] ("TNC") protocol specification, based on the principles of [[AAA protocol|AAA]], but adding the ability to authorize network clients on the basis of [[computer hardware|hardware]] configuration, [[BIOS]], [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] version, and which updates that have been applied to the [[Operating system|OS]] and [[anti-virus software]], etc.<ref>https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/downloads/specifications/TNC_Architecture_v1_0_r4.pdf</ref> In 2009, TCG released a set of specifications that describe the protocol to communicate with [[Hardware-based full disk encryption|self encrypting disk drives]]. The TCG Storage Work Group (SWG) Storage Core Architecture Specification describes in detail how to implement and utilize trust and security services on [[storage device]]s. Security Subsystem Class (SSC) Specifications describe the requirements for specific classes of devices; specifically, the Enterprise SSC defines minimum requirements for Data Center and Server Class devices while the Opal SSC defines minimum requirements for client devices. The owner of a TPM-enabled system has complete control over what software does and does not run on their system <ref>[https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/faq/TPMFAQ/ The Trusted Platform Module FAQ] from the TCG website</ref> This does include the possibility that a system owner would choose to run a version of an [[operating system]] (OS) that refuses to load unsigned or unlicensed software, but those restrictions would have to be enforced by the operating system and not by the TCG technology. What a TPM does provide in this case is the capability for the OS to lock software to specific machine configurations, meaning that "hacked" versions of the OS designed to get around these restrictions would not work. While there is legitimate concern that OS vendors could use these capabilities to restrict what software would load under their OS (hurting small software companies or [[open source]]/[[shareware]]/[[freeware]] providers, and causing [[vendor lock-in]] for some data formats), no OS vendor has yet suggested that this is planned.{{When|date=October 2010}} Furthermore, since restrictions would be a function of the operating system, TPMs could in no way restrict alternative operating systems from running, including free or open source operating systems. There are several projects which are experimenting with TPM support in free operating systems; examples of such projects include a TPM device driver for Linux<ref>[http://tpmdd.sourceforge.net Linux TPM Device Driver<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, an open source implementation of the TCG's Trusted Software Stack called TrouSerS<ref>[http://trousers.sourceforge.net TrouSerS - The open-source TCG Software Stack<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (recently also ported to [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]<ref>[http://security.polito.it/tc/trouserswin TrouSerS for Windows<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>), a [[Java]] interface to TPM capabilities called TPM/J<ref>[http://projects.csail.mit.edu/tc/tpmj/ TPM/J Java-based API for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and a TPM-supporting version of the [[GNU GRUB|Grub]] [[bootloader]] called TrustedGrub.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/projects/trustedgrub/ SourceForge.net: TrustedGRUB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> == Related projects == The TPM 1.1 specification envisioned a standard PC platform equipped with a TPM chip. In this scenario, the TPM chip can serve as a hardware key storage. Additionally, it can keep track of so-called measurements of the platform (i.e. hashes of various software) and be able to produce signed statements about the running software chain. Particularly the latter mode of operation proved unfeasible in practice, since the amount of software that has to be measured and trusted is very large; it includes (in addition to the system firmware) the operating system, [[Device driver|drivers]] and application programs. Therefore, numerous other TPM-related projects are in progress, the purpose of which is to make it possible to launch and measure a trusted subenvironment from within an untrusted environment. The TPM specification 1.2 has been enhanced to accommodate this mode of operation. Additionally, hardware changes are required in the [[CPU]] and chipset (note that this should not be confused with the inclusion of TPM functionality into the chipset even though this is a possibility too). [[Intel]]'s approach is called [[Trusted Execution Technology]] (TXT). Many of Intel's Core 2 Duo CPUs are advertised to support these extensions. However, chipset support is required for the extensions to be operational. Currently, Intel's chipset Q35 Express supports TXT. In addition to chipset support, the [[mainboard]] must also feature a TPM 1.2 chip. Intel currently advertises DQ35MP and DQ35JO as being compliant with the technology. The first application of the technology will be a
