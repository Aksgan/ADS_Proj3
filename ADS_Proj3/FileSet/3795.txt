fit [[cubic polynomial]] [[B-spline]] curves to the peptide planes. Most modern graphics systems provide B-splines as a basic drawing primitive. B-Splines are well suited to fitting between data points but not necessarily interpolating through each of those points. To create a line that intersects all data points, [[Hermite spline]]s can be used. In order to give the right radius for helical spirals while preserving smooth β-strands, B-splines can be modified by offsets proportional to local curvature, as first developed by Mike Carson for his Ribbons program<ref>{{Citation |first=M. |last=Carson |first2=C.

Since their inception, and continuing in the present, a ribbon diagram is the single most common representation of protein structures and a very common choice of cover image for a journal or textbook. ===Current computer programs=== [[Image:Tubby-1c8z-pymol.png|thumb|160px| [[PyMol]] ribbon of the unusual structure of the "tubby" brain protein]] One popular program used for drawing ribbon diagrams is [[Molscript]]. Molscript utilizes [[Hermite spline]]s to create coordinates for coils, turns, strands and helices. The curve passes through all its control points (Cα atoms) guided by direction vectors. The program was built on the basis of traditional molecular graphics by [[Arthur M. Lesk]], Karl Hardman, and John Priestle.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.avatar.se/molscript/doc/about.html |title=MolScript v2.1: About the program }}</ref> <!-- An example of a ribbon diagram produced by Molscript is shown in Figure 1. --> [[Jmol]] is an open-source Java-based viewer for browsing molecular structures on the web; it includes a simplified "cartoon" version of ribbons.

He is also [[professor]] of [[Computer programming]] at [[Middlesex University]]. Previously he was at [[Queen Mary, University of London]]. == Research == Bornat's research interests includes ''program proving'' in [[separation logic]]. His focus is on the [[Proof theory|proof]]s themselves; as opposed to any logical underpinnings. Much of the work involves discovering ways to state the properties of independent modules, in a manner that makes their composition into useful systems conducive. Bornat (in conjunction with [[Bernard Sufrin]] of the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory]]) developed [[Jape_(software)|Jape]], a [[proof calculator]]; he is involved in research on the usability of this tool for exploration of novel proofs. Richard Bornat's PhD students have included [[Samson Abramsky]] in the early 1980s. In 2004, one of Bornat's students developed an aptitude test to ''"divide people up into programmers and non-programmers before they ever come into contact with programming."'' The test was first given to a group of students in 2005 during an experiment on the use of
