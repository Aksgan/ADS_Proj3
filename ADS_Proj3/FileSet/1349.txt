to its full potential. Practitioners cite the following major issues which EII must address for the industry to become mature:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} ; simplicity of understanding : Answering queries with views arouses interest from a theoretical standpoint, but difficulties in understanding how to incorporate it as an "enterprise solution".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Some developers{{Who|date=June 2009}} believe it should be merged with [[Enterprise application integration|EAI]]. Others{{Who|date=June 2009}} believe it should be incorporated with [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] systems, citing customers' confusion over the differences between the two services.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} ; simplicity of deployment : Even if recognized as a solution to a problem, EII {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}}currently takes time to apply and offers complexities in deployment. People have proposed a variety of schema-less solutions such as "Lean Middleware" <ref name="reffour">{{cite conference | author=David A.

Answering these kinds of questions about a set of repositories requires semantic information like [[metadata]] and/or ontologies. The few commercial tools{{Which?|date=June 2009}} that leverage this information remain in their infancy. == Applications == EII products enable [[loose coupling]] between [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]]-data consuming client applications and services and [[heterogeneous]]-data stores. Such client applications and services include Desktop Productivity Tools ([[spreadsheet]]s, [[word processor]]s, presentation software, etc.), [[Integrated development environment|Development Environment]]s and [[Software framework|Framework]]s ([[Java EE]], [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]], [[Mono (software)|Mono]], [[SOAP]] or [[Representational State Transfer|REST]]ian [[Web service]]s, etc.), [[business intelligence]] (BI), [[business activity monitoring]] (BAM) software, [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM), [[Business Process Management]] (BPM and/or BPEL) Software, and [[web content management]] (CMS). == Data access technologies == *[[ADO.NET]] *[[JDBC]] *[[ODBC]] *[[OLE DB]] *[[XQuery]] *[[Service Data Objects]] (SDO) for Java, C++ and .Net clients and any type of data source ==See also== * [[Business Intelligence 2.0]] (BI 2.0) * [[Data access]] * [[Data integration]] * [[Data Warehouse]] * [[Enterprise Application Integration]] * [[Enterprise integration]] * [[Federated database system]] * [[Information as a Service]] * [[Semantic integration]] * [[Semantic Web]] * [[Web 2.0]] * [[Web services]] * [[Web integration]] == Vendors== * [[Composite Software]] * [[Denodo]] * [[IBM]] * [[Microsoft]] * [[OpenLink Software]] * [[Queplix]] * [[Red Hat]] ==References== <references/> [[Category:Data management]] [[fr:Enterprise Information Integration]] [[he:אינטגרציית מידע ארגונית]] [[no:Informasjonsintegrasjon]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12234</id> <title>Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language</title> <text>'''Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language (EPAL)''' is a [[formal language]] for writing enterprise privacy policies to govern data handling practices in IT systems according to fine-grained positive and negative authorization rights.

It was originally built for the [[Queensland University of Technology]] and subsequently made available to all under the [[Apache license|Apache 2.0 license]]. ESOE is standards based, complying with [[Saml|SAML 2.0]] and implementing a significant subset of [[XACML|XACML 2.0]]. The core server system is developed in Java while connectivity to services is achieved through provided SAML service provider software for [[Apache Tomcat]]/[[JBoss]], [[Apache http|Apache Web Servers]] and [[Internet Information Services|Microsoft IIS]]. Further to this ESOE is able to act as hub for identity protocols and is able to translate tokens from [[Shibboleth (Internet2)|Shibboleth]] and [[OpenID]] to its internal SAML 2.0 token type. The design goals of ESOE are such that it should interact with any type of service and even aggregate identity data across them. Support for [[LDAP]] compliant servers and Microsoft [[Active Directory]] are implemented as reference plugins for the authentication 'pipeline'. ==Architecture== The underlying architecture of ESOE is such that all modules are able to be removed, replaced or reimplemented to suit a specific deployment. This is achieved with heavy utilization of the [[Spring Framework]] and [[Java interface|interface driven]] design. Development is carried out with using Agile principals and the software includes hundreds of automated test cases. For added flexibility each core part of the system has been developed using a pluggable pipeline approach. This means that authentication, identity and SSO events must each traverse a pipeline of plugins which all perform different tasks. This allows organizations to add functionality specific to their deployment while still taking advantage of the core logic. The entire system is built using a centralized ESOE Build system which relies on [[Apache Ant]]. Dependencies in the system are automatically maintained by heavy integration with [[Apache Ivy]]. [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] is the preferred development environment. All code is stored in [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]]. == External links == *[http://esoeproject.org ESOE Project Page] [[Category:Java enterprise platform]] [[Category:Java platform]] [[Category:Identity management systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12250</id> <title>Enterprise information access</title> <text>'''Enterprise information access''' refers to [[information systems]] that allow for [[enterprise search]]; [[content classification]]; [[content clustering]]; [[information extraction]]; [[enterprise bookmarking]]; [[taxonomy]] creation and management; information presentation (for example, visualization) to support analysis and understanding; and desktop or personal knowledge search. ==See also== * [[Enterprise content management]] * [[Intranet]] ==References== * Gartner Forecast: Information Access and Search
