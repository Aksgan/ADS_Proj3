The heart of the TINKER package is a modular set of callable routines which allow the manipulation of coordinates and evaluation of potential energy and derivatives in a straightforward fashion. TINKER works on Windows, Mac, and Unix/Linux and its source code is available free of charge. The code was written in [[FORTRAN77]] with common extensions and some [[C programming language|C]]. The code is maintained by Jay Ponder at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]. ==Features== Programs are provided to perform many functions including: # energy minimization over Cartesian coordinates, torsional angles or rigid bodies via conjugate gradient, variable metric or a truncated Newton method; # molecular, stochastic, and rigid body dynamics with periodic boundaries and control of temperature and pressure; # normal mode vibrational analysis; # distance geometry including an efficient random pairwise metrization; # building protein and nucleic acid structures from sequence; # [[simulated annealing]] with various cooling protocols; # analysis and breakdown of single point potential energies; # verification of analytical derivatives of standard and user defined potentials; # location of a transition state between two minima; # full energy surface search via a "Conformation Scanning" method; # free energy calculations via [[free energy perturbation]] or weighted histogram analysis; # fitting of intermolecular potential parameters to structural and thermodynamic data; and # global optimization via energy surface smoothing, including a "Potential Smoothing and Search" (PSS) method. ==See also== * [[List of software for Monte Carlo molecular modeling]] * [[Molecular dynamics]] * [[Molecular geometry]] * [[Molecular design software]] * [[Force field implementation]] * [[Folding@Home]] ==References== * P.

Data in IBM Cognos TM1 is stored and represented as [[MOLAP|multidimensional OLAP]] [[OLAP cube | cubes]], with data being stored at the "leaf" level. Computations on the leaf data are performed in real-time (for example, to aggregate numbers up a dimensional hierarchy). IBM Cognos TM1 includes a data orchestration environment for accessing external data and systems, as well as capabilities designed for common business planning and budgeting requirements (e.g. workflow, top-down adjustments). Several new features were added to IBM Cognos TM1 9.5, the most visible being TM1 Contributor, which combines an OLAP engine with the enterprise planning capabilities of IBM Cognos Planning in a Web-based client. Other features include an "Undo/Redo" capability that lets users store a collection of data value changes and walk back through the actions to undo them; pick lists for cells to reduce the amount of data entry performed; sandboxes for creating personal modeling scenarios; and data entry shortcuts.
