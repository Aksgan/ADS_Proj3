As a result it is necessary to determine a means for terminating photon packets of sufficiently small weight. A simple method would use a threshold, and if the weight of the photon packet is below the threshold, the packet is considered dead. The aforementioned method is limited as it does not conserve energy. To keep total energy constant, a [[Russian roulette]] technique is often employed for photons below a certain weight threshold. This technique uses a roulette constant ''m'' to determine whether or not the photon will survive. The photon packet has one chance in ''m'' to survive, in which case it will be given a new weight of ''mW'' where ''W'' is the initial weight (this new weight, on average, conserves energy). All other times, the photon weight is set to 0 and the photon is terminated. This is expressed mathematically below: : <math> W = \begin{cases} mW&\xi \leq 1/m \\ 0&\xi > 1/m \end{cases} </math> == Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and fast Monte Carlo simulations of photon transport == Monte Carlo simulation of photon migration in turbid media is a highly parallelable problem, where a large number of photons are propagated independently, but according to identical rules and different random number sequences. The parallel nature of this special type of Monte Carlo simulation renders it highly suitable for execution on a graphics processing unit (GPU). The release of programmable GPUs started such a development, and since 2008 there are a few reports on the use of GPU for high-speed Monte Carlo simulation of photon migration <ref name=Alerstam2008_JBiomedOpt/> <ref name=Fang2009_OptExpress/> <ref name=Ren2010_OptExpress/>. == Acceleration of Monte Carlo simulation using GPU cluster== Monte Carlo simulation is of great significance in simulating the light propagation in tissues, which quantifies the light delivered to the treated tissue and is an important factor for improving clinical results. However, Monte Carlo simulation is very time-consuming because of the extensive computational burden. It limits the practical application of Monte Carlo method greatly. To improve the performance of Monte Carlo simulation for photon transport in turbid media, a new version of Monte Carlo program for simulation of light transport in multi-layered tissues is developed base on the GPU Cluster. it is called "GPU Cluster MCML" in simple words. It has the same function as Lihong Wang and Steven L. Jacques' "MCML" running on the CPU. In the "GPU Cluster MCML", Distributed Computing of GPU Clusters installed in different personal computers within a local area network (LAN) are employed to accelerating the simulation greatly.

The traditional concept arose with the cycle of [[moon phase]]s; such months ([[lunation]]s) are [[#Synodic month|synodic months]] and last approximately 29.53 [[day]]s. From excavated [[tally stick]]s, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's [[orbital period]], are still the basis of many calendars<!--unnecessarily generic?--> today, and are used to divide the [[year]]. ==Types of months== {{main|Lunar month}} The following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy, most of them (but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months) first recognized in [[Lunar theory#Babylon|Babylonian lunar astronomy]]. === Sidereal month === The period of the Moon's orbit as defined with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] (of the fixed stars, nowadays the [[International Celestial Reference Frame|International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF)]]) is known as a ''sidereal'' month because it is the time it takes the Moon
