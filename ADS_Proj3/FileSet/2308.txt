For example, the [[nasal consonant|nasal]] sound {{IPA|[n]}} gives a more personal and speaker-oriented impression than the [[velar consonant|velars]] {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}; this contrast can be easily noticed in pairs of [[synonym]]s such as ので ''node'' and から ''kara'' which both mean ''because'', but with the first being perceived as more subjective. This relationship can be correlated with phenomimes containing nasal and velar sounds: While phenomimes containing [[nasal consonant]]s give the feeling of tactuality and warmth, those containing [[velar consonant]]s tend to represent hardness, sharpness, and suddenness. Similarly, [[Japanese adjectives|i-type adjective]]s that contain the fricative {{IPAblink|ɕ}} in the group ''shi'' tend to represent human emotive states, such as in the words 悲しい ''kanashii'' (''sad''), 寂しい ''sabishii'' (''lonely''), 嬉しい ''ureshii'' (''happy''), and 楽しい ''tanoshii'' (''enjoyable''). This too is correlated with those phenomimes and psychomimes containing the same fricative sound, for example しとしとと降る ''shitoshito to furu'' (''to rain / snow quietly'') and しゅんとする ''shun to suru'' (''to be dispirited''). The use of the [[consonant length|gemination]] can create a more emphatic or emotive version of a word, as in the following pairs of words: ぴたり / ぴったり ''pitari / pittari'' (''tightly''), やはり / やっぱり ''yahari / yappari'' (''as expected''), 放し / っ放し ''hanashi / ppanashi'' (''leaving, having left [something] in a particular state''), and many others. ==See also== *[[Sound symbolism]] *[[Ideophone]] *[[Kuchi shoga]], a system for "pronouncing" drum sounds *[[:wikt:Category:ja:Onomatopoeia|Japanese onomatopoeia]] at Wiktionary **[[wikt:Category:Giongo|Giongo]] **[[wikt:Category:Gitaigo|Gitaigo]] == References == * Akutsu, Satoru (1994).

He was an active participant in the origins of [[StopBadware]], set up by the [[Berkman Center for Internet & Society]] and [[Google]] to track malicious web sites. Armin first came into the public eye in 2007 from his exposure of the [[Russian Business Network|RBN (Russian Business Network)]]. Throughout 2007, via a dedicated blog entitled RBNExploit,<ref>[http://rbnexploit.blogspot.com Jart Armin's RBN blog]</ref> he provided reports and analysis on the undercover operations of the RBN criminal gang, despite constant DDoS attempts and artificially-created mirror websites. With regular blogs and alliance with third parties, Armin raised public awareness of the activities of the RBN which were subsequently reported on in major newspaper articles.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202461.html "Shadowy Russian Firm Seen as Conduit for Cybercrime"] by [[Brian Krebs]], [[The Washington Post]]. December 10th, 2007. Retrieved 2010-08-22.</ref> It was via the RBN blog that Armin provided the first reports of cyber attacks, used in conjunction with the invasion of Georgia by Russian troops, three days in advance of the attack in August 2008.<ref>[http://rbnexploit.blogspot.com/2008/08/rbn-georgia-cyberwarfare-attribution.html "Georgia Cyberwarfare – Attribution & Spam Botnets"] - RBN Blog</ref> As an advocate of an [[open source]] community approach to the fight against cybercrime, Armin established HostExploit<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/ HostExploit website]</ref> as an educational website aimed at exposing internet bad actors and cybercriminal organizations which deliver [[crimeware]] through hosts and registrars. ==The Reports== In August 2008, Jart Armin, via HostExploit, published a definitive report "[[Atrivo]] - Cyber Crime USA",<ref name="atrivo">[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/12.html "Atrivo - Cyber Crime USA"] - HostExploit Report</ref> stating that Atrivo (aka Intercage) - a [[Concord]], [[California]], [[United States]]-based [[website hosting]] provider deliberately allowed cyber criminals to use its services. This brought about the shutdown of Atrivo with a related 10% drop in botnet and spam activity worldwide. In November 2008, Armin published a further definitive report, "[[McColo]] - Cyber Crime USA",<ref>"[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/14.html "McColo - Cyber Crime USA"] - HostExploit Report</ref> with contributions from [[StopBadware]], [[Trend Micro]], Emerging Threats, [[KnujOn]], Sunbelt, CastleCops, [[The Spamhaus Project]], [[Arbor Networks]], Malwaredomains, Threat Expert, [[SecureWorks]], [[aa419]], Malwaredatabase and Robtex.
