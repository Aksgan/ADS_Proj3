sources in infinite homogeneous media=== A solution to the diffusion equation for the simple case of a short-pulsed point source in an infinite homogeneous medium is presented in this section. The source term in the diffusion equation becomes <math>S(\vec{r},t, \vec{r'},t')=\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})\delta(t-t')</math>, where <math>\vec{r}</math> is the position at which fluence rate is measured and <math>\vec{r'}</math> is the position of the source. The pulse peaks at time <math>t'</math>. The diffusion equation is solved for fluence rate to yield :<math>\Phi(\vec{r},t;\vec{r'},t)=\frac{c}{[4\pi Dc(t-t')^{3/2}]}\exp\left[-\frac{\mid \vec{r}-\vec{r'} \mid ^2}{rDc(t-t')}\right]\exp[-\mu_ac(t-t')]</math> The term <math>\exp\left[-\mu_ac(t-t')\right]</math> represents the exponential decay in fluence rate due to absorption in accordance with [[Beer's law]]. The other terms represent broadening due to scattering. Given the above solution, an arbitrary source can be characterized as a superposition of short-pulsed point sources. Taking time variation out of the diffusion equation gives the following for a time-independent point source <math>S(\vec{r})=\delta(\vec{r})</math>: :<math>\Phi(\vec{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi Dr}\exp(-\mu_{eff}r)</math> <math>\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_a}{D}}</math> is the effective [[attenuation coefficient]] and indicates the rate of spatial decay in fluence<ref name="Wang_BioMedBooK"/>. ===Boundary conditions=== ====Fluence rate at a boundary==== Consideration of boundary conditions permits use of the diffusion equation to characterize light propagation in media of limited size (where interfaces between the medium and the ambient environment must be considered). To begin to address a boundary, one can consider what happens when photons in the medium reach a boundary (i.e. a surface). The direction-integrated radiance at the boundary and directed into the medium is equal to the direction-integrated radiance at the boundary and directed out of the medium multiplied by [[Fresnel equations|reflectance]] <math>R_F</math>: :<math>\int_{\hat{s}\cdot \hat{n}<0}L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)\hat{s}\cdot \hat{n} d\Omega=\int_{\hat{s}\cdot \hat{n}>0}R_F(\hat{s}\cdot \hat{n})L(\vec{r},\hat{s},t)\hat{s}\cdot \hat{n}d\Omega</math> where <math>\hat{n}</math> is normal to and pointing away from the boundary. The diffusion approximation gives an expression for radiance <math>L</math> in terms of fluence rate <math>\Phi</math> and current density <math>\vec{J}</math>. Evaluating the above integrals after substitution gives<ref name=Haskell_1994>{{cite journal |author=RC Haskell et al. |title=Boundary conditions for the diffusion equation in radiative transfer|journal=[[Journal of the Optical Society of America A]]|volume=11|pages=2727–2741|year=1994 |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.11.002727}}</ref>: [[Image:Pencil Beam.png|thumb|right|Figure 2: The steps in representing a pencil beam incident on a semi-infinite anisotropically scattering medium as two isotropic point sources in an infinite medium.]] :<math>\frac{\Phi(\vec{r},t)}{4}+\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)\cdot \frac{\hat{n}}{2}=R_{\Phi}\frac{\Phi(\vec{r},t)}{4}-R_{J}\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)\cdot \frac{\hat{n}}{2}</math> *<math>R_{\Phi}=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}2\sin \theta \cos \theta R_F(\cos \theta)d\theta</math> *<math>R_{J}=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}3\sin \theta (\cos \theta)^2 R_F(\cos \theta)d\theta</math> Substituting Fick's law (<math>\vec{J}(\vec{r},t)=-D\nabla \Phi(\vec{r},t)</math>) gives, at a distance from the boundary z=0<ref name=Haskell_1994>{{cite journal |author=RC Haskell et al. |title=Boundary conditions for the diffusion equation in radiative transfer.|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A |volume=11|pages=2727–2741|year=1994 |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.11.002727}}</ref>, :<math>\Phi(\vec{r},t)=A_z\frac{\partial \Phi(\vec{r},t)}{\partial z}</math> *<math>A_z=2D\frac{1+R_{eff}}{1-R_{eff}}</math> *<math>R_{\mathrm{eff}}=\frac{R_{\Phi}+R_{J}}{2-R_{\Phi}+R_J}</math> ====The extrapolated boundary==== It is desirable to identify a zero-fluence boundary. However, the fluence rate <math>\Phi(z=0, t)</math> at a physical boundary is, in general, not zero. An extrapolated boundary, at <math>z</math><sub>b</sub> for which fluence rate is zero, can be determined to establish image sources. Using a first order [[Taylor series]] approximation, :<math>\left.\Phi(z=-A_z,t)\approx \Phi(z=0,t)-A_z\frac{\partial \Phi(\vec{r},t)}{\partial z}\right|_{z=0}</math> which evaluates to zero since <math>\Phi(\vec{r},t)=A_z\frac{\partial \Phi(\vec{r},t)}{\partial z}</math>. Thus, by definition, <math>z</math><sub>b</sub> must be <math>-A</math><sub>z</sub> as defined above. Notably, when the index of refraction is the same on both sides of the boundary, <math>R</math><sub>F</sub> is zero and the extrapolated boundary is at <math>z</math><sub>b</sub><math>=-2D</math>.<ref name="Haskell_1994"/> ===Pencil beam normally incident on a semi-infinite medium=== Using boundary conditions, one may approximately characterize diffuse reflectance for a [[pencil beam]] normally incident on a semi-infinite medium.

The assumptions involved in characterizing photon behavior with the diffusion equation generate inaccuracies. Generally, the diffusion approximation is less accurate as the absorption coefficient μ<sub>a</sub> increases and the scattering coefficient μ<sub>s</sub> decreases <ref name=Yoo1990_PhysRevLett> K.

For a photon beam incident on a medium of limited depth, error due to the diffusion approximation is most prominent within one transport mean free path of the location of photon incidence (where radiance is not yet isotropic) (Figure 3). <br />Among the steps in describing a pencil beam incident on a semi-infinite medium with the diffusion equation, converting the medium from anisotropic to isotropic (step 1) (Figure 4) and converting the beam to a source (step 2) (Figure 5) generate more error than converting from a single source to a pair of image sources (step 3) (Figure 6).
