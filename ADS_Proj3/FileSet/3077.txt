(page 10), and "(...)At the time of writing, the Neumont ORM Architect (NORMA) tool provides the most complete support for the ORM 2 notation discussed in this book." (Preface, xxv). He also states: "A modeling method as good as ORM deserves a good CASE tool. Over the last decade, talented staff at ServerWare, Asymetrix Corporation, InfoModelers Incorporated, Visio Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Neumont University have worked to develop state of the art CASE tools to support the specific ORM method discussed in this book. The following talented individuals currently working as lead software engineers on the NORMA tool deserve special mention: Matt Curland and Kevin Owen." (Preface, xxvi) == ORM2 == ORM2 (second-generation ORM) is a new incarnation of Object-Role Modeling as well as a new modeling tool to support the new notation. Dr. [[Terry Halpin]] is leading the effort spearheaded by [[Neumont University]] and later continued through The ORM Foundation<ref name="ORMF">The [http://www.ormfoundation.org/ ORM Foundation] home page</ref>, a UK-based non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of the fact-oriented approach to information modeling ORM 2 is both a metamodel that defines an ORM2 model and a tool (NORMA) for creating ORM2 models. The NORMA (Natural ORM Architect) tool is an open source project. ORM2 leverages the work done by the BSBR group. The main objectives for the ORM 2 graphical notation are:<ref>http://www.orm.net/pdf/ORM2.pdf Halpin, T. 2005, ‘ORM 2’, On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2005: OTM 2005 Workshops, eds R.
