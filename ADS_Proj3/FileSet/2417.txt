copy and do not need line-of-sight to operate. Programming these remotes sometimes requires the automotive dealership to connect a diagnostic tool, but many of them can be self-programmed by following a sequence of steps in the vehicle and usually requires at least one working key. Key fobs are increasingly used in [[apartment buildings]] and [[condominium]] buildings for access to common areas (ie. lobby doors, storage areas, fitness room, pool). These usually contain a [[Radio-frequency identification|passive RFID]] tag. The fob operates in much the same manner as a [[proximity card]] to communicate (via a reader pad) with a central server for the building, which can be programmed to allow access only to those areas in which the tenant or owner is permitted to access, or only within certain time frames. [[Image:RSA-SecurID-Tokens.jpg|thumb|[[Security token]]s from [[RSA Security]] designed as key fobs.]] [[Telecommuters]] may also use an electronic device known as a key fob that provides one part of a three way match to log in over an [[secure|unsecure]] [[computer network|network]] connection to a secure network. This kind of key fob may have a keypad on which the user must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] to retrieve an access code, or it could be a display-only device such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] token that algorithmically generates security codes as part of a [[challenge-response authentication|challenge/response]] authentication system. ==See also== *[[Netsuke]] *[[Keychain]] [[Category:Tools]] [[Category:Key management]] [[de:Schlüsselanhänger]] [[es:Llavero]] [[fr:Porte-clef]] [[lb:Porte-clefs]] [[lt:Rakto pakabukas]] [[nl:Sleutelhanger]] [[ja:キーホルダー]] [[pl:Breloczek do kluczy]] [[ru:Брелок]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20615</id> <title>Key size</title> <text>In [[cryptography]], '''key size''' or '''key length''' is the size measured in bits<ref>[[Password strength#Human-generated passwords|Calculating Bit Strength]]</ref> of the [[key (cryptography)|key]] used in a cryptographic algorithm (such as a [[cipher]]). An algorithm's key length is distinct from its cryptographic security, which is a logarithmic measure of the fastest known computational attack on the algorithm, also measured in bits. The security of an algorithm cannot exceed its key length (since any algorithm can be cracked by [[brute force attack|brute force]]), but it can be smaller. For example, [[Triple DES]] has a key size of 168 bits but provides at most 112 bits of security, since an attack of complexity 2<sup>112</sup> is known. This property of Triple DES is not a weakness provided 112 bits of security is sufficient for an application. Most [[symmetric-key algorithm]]s in common use are designed to have security equal to their key length. No [[asymmetric-key algorithm]]s with this property are known; [[elliptic curve cryptography]] comes the closest with an effective security of roughly half its key length. ==Significance== [[Key (cryptography)|Keys]] are used to control the operation of a cipher so that only the correct key can convert encrypted text ([[ciphertext]]) to [[plaintext]]. Many ciphers are based on publicly known [[algorithm]]s or are [[open source]], and so it is only the difficulty of obtaining the key that determines security of the system, provided that there is no analytic attack (i.e., a 'structural weakness' in the algorithms or protocols used), and assuming that the key is not otherwise available (such as via theft, extortion, or compromise of computer systems). The widely accepted notion that the security of the system should depend on the key alone has been explicitly formulated by [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]] (in the 1880s) and [[Claude Shannon]] (in the 1940s); the statements are known as [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] and Shannon's Maxim respectively. A key should therefore be large enough that a brute force attack (possible against any encryption algorithm) is infeasible &ndash; i.e, would take too long to execute. [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] work on [[information theory]] showed that to achieve so called ''[[perfect secrecy]]'', it is necessary for the key length to be at least as large as the message to be transmitted and only used once (this algorithm is called the [[One-time pad]]). In light of this, and the practical difficulty of managing such long keys, modern cryptographic practice has discarded the notion of perfect secrecy as a requirement for encryption, and instead focuses on ''[[computational security]]'', under which the computational requirements of breaking an encrypted text must be infeasible for an attacker. The [[preferred numbers]] commonly used as key sizes (in bits) are powers of two, potentially multiplied with a small odd integer. ==Key size and encryption system== Encryption systems are often grouped into families. Common families include symmetric systems (e.g. [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]) and asymmetric systems (e.g. [[RSA]]); they may alternatively be grouped according to the central [[algorithm]] used (e.g. [[elliptic curve cryptography]]). As each of these is of a different level of cryptographic complexity, it is usual to have different key sizes for the same level of security, depending upon the algorithm used. For example, the security available with a 1024-bit key using asymmetric RSA is considered approximately equal in security to an 80-bit key in a symmetric algorithm (Source: [[RSA Security]]). The actual degree of security achieved over time varies, as more computational power and more powerful mathematical analytic methods become available. For this reason cryptologists tend to look at indicators that an algorithm or key length shows signs of potential vulnerability, to move to longer key sizes or more difficult algorithms. For example {{As of|2007|05|lc=on}}, a 1039 bit integer was factored with the [[special number field sieve]] using 400 computers over 11 months.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132184-pg,1/article.html Researcher: RSA 1024-bit Encryption not Enough]</ref> The factored number was of a special form; the special number field sieve cannot be used on RSA keys. The computation is roughly equivalent to breaking a 700 bit RSA key. However, this might be an advanced warning that 1024 bit RSA used in secure online commerce should be [[deprecation|deprecated]], since they may become breakable in the near future. Cryptography professor [[Arjen Lenstra]] observed that "Last time, it took nine years for us to generalize from a special to a nonspecial, hard-to-factor number" and when asked whether 1024-bit RSA keys are dead, said: "The answer to that question is an unqualified yes."<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070523-researchers-307-digit-key-crack-endangers-1024-bit-rsa.html Researchers: 307-digit key crack endangers 1024-bit RSA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Brute force attack== {{Main|Brute force attack}} Even if a symmetric cipher is currently unbreakable by
