At the insert in the upper left corner of this image one can see the partially eclipsed sun that was photographed with a white solar filter. At the bottom of the image one can see the projection of the partially eclipsed sun.]] Looking directly at the [[photosphere]] of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even for just a few seconds, can cause permanent damage to the [[retina]] of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in permanent impairment of vision, up to and including [[blindness]]. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.<ref>{{Cite web|author=F. Espenak |title=Eye Safety During Solar Eclipses |url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/safety.html}}</ref> Under normal conditions, the Sun is so bright that it is difficult to stare at it directly, so there is no tendency to look at it in a way that might damage the eye. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Unfortunately, looking at the Sun during an eclipse is just as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage in a fraction of a second.<ref>{{Cite web|author=A.

If the eclipse is near total, the low average amount of light causes the pupil to open. Unfortunately the remaining parts of the Sun are still just as bright, so they are now brighter on the retina than when looking at a full Sun. As the eye has a small [[Optic fovea|fovea]], for detailed viewing, the tendency will be to track the image on to this best part of the retina, causing damage. ===Partial and annular eclipses=== [[Image:Eclipsbrilletje.JPG|thumb|Eclipse glasses]] Viewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses outside the brief period of totality) requires special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods, if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters should be used for direct viewing of the Sun's disk.<ref>{{Cite web|author=O. Staiger |title=Observing Eclipses Safely |url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Totality/TotalityCh11.html}}</ref> Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a [[floppy disk]] removed from its case, a [[Compact Disc]], a black colour slide film, etc. must be avoided despite what may have been said in the media.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/filters.html| title=Eclipse Filters| accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> The safest way to view the Sun's disk is by indirect projection. This can be done by projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1 mm diameter), often called a [[pinhole camera]]. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe [[sunspot]]s, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a [[video camera]] or [[digital camera]]) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible.<ref>[http://www.perkins-observatory.org/eclipsesafety.html Eclipse Viewing Safety], [[Perkins Observatory]].</ref> Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path one will not be able to see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, yet, depending on how much of the sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If two-thirds or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows. ===Totality=== It is safe to observe the total phase of a solar eclipse directly with the unaided eye, binoculars or a telescope, only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon. During this period the sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint [[corona]] will be visible, and the [[chromosphere]], [[solar prominence]]s, and possibly even a [[solar flare]] may be seen. However, viewing the Sun after totality can be dangerous. [[File:TheSun beads.jpg|thumb|[[Baily's beads]]]] When the shrinking visible part of the photosphere becomes very small, [[Baily's beads]] will occur. These are caused by the sunlight still being able to reach Earth through lunar valleys, but no longer where mountains are present. Totality then begins with the [[Diamond Ring effect (Solar Eclipse)|diamond ring effect]], the last bright flash of sunlight.<ref>{{Cite web|author=O. Staiger |title=The Experience of Totality |url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Totality/TotalityCh01.html}}</ref> At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and on the opposite side of the moon. ===Photography=== Photographing an eclipse is possible with fairly common camera equipment. In order for the disk of the sun/moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification [[long focus lens]]
