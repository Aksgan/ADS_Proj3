Shannon had showed that almost all [[Boolean functions]] of ''n'' variables need a [[circuit complexity|circuit]] of size at least 2<sup>''n''</sup>''n''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The reciprocal is that: <blockquote> All Boolean functions of ''n'' variables can be computed with a circuit of at most 2<sup>''n''</sup>''n''<sup>&minus;1</sup> + o(2<sup>''n''</sup>''n''<sup>&minus;1</sup>) gates. </blockquote> ==Definition== The idea is to represent the values of a boolean function ''&fnof;'' in a table of 2<sup>''k''</sup> rows, representing the possible values of the ''k'' first variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ,''x''<sub>''k''</sub>, and 2<sup>''n''&minus;''k''</sup> columns representing the values of the other variables. Let ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A''<sub>''p''</sub> be a partition of the rows of this table such that for ''i'' < ''p'', |''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''s'' and <math>|A_p|=s'\leq s</math>. Let ''&fnof;''<sub>''i''</sub>(''x'') = ''&fnof;''(''x'') [[iff]] ''x'' &isin; ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>. Moreover, let <math>B_{i,w}</math> be the set of the columns whose intersection with <math>A_i</math> is <math>w</math>.

It began as a research project in the early 1980s. In 1993, it progressed to practical, industrial use, in a commercial product, as the core language of the industrial environment [[SCADE]], developed by [[Esterel Technologies]]. It is now used for critical control software in [[Airbus|aircraft]], [[Eurocopter Group|helicopters]], and [[nuclear power plant]]s. ==See also== *[[SCADE]] (Software Critical Application Development Environment), a lustre-based IDE generating C-code *[[Esterel]] *[[Synchronous programming language]] *[[Dataflow programming]] ==External links== * [http://www-verimag.imag.fr/SYNCHRONE/ Synchrone Lab] Official website * [http://www.esterel-technologies.com/products/scade-suite/overview.html SCADE] product page [[Category:Declarative programming languages]] [[Category:Synchronous programming languages]] [[Category:Hardware description languages]] [[Category:Formal methods]] [[Category:Dataflow language]] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[de:Lustre (Programmiersprache)]] [[fr:Lustre (langage)]] [[pl:Lustre (język programowania)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22780</id> <title>Lxrun</title> <text>{{lowercase}} {{Infobox software |name = lxrun |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |collapsible = |author = Mike Davidson |developer = |released = 1997 <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |latest release version = 0.9.6pre1 |latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |latest preview version = |latest preview date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |frequently updated = |programming language = |operating system = [[UnixWare]], [[SCO OpenServer]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] |platform = |size = |language = |status = |genre = [[Compatibility layer]] |license = [[Mozilla Public License]] |website = http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~steven/lxrun/ }} {{Portal|Free software}} In [[Unix]] [[computing]], '''lxrun''' is a [[compatibility layer]] to allow [[Linux]] binaries to run on [[UnixWare]], [[SCO OpenServer]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] without recompilation. It was created by Mike Davidson. It has been an [[open source]] software project since 1997, and is available under the [[Mozilla Public License]].

They describe the dominant instabilities of a dynamical system, i.e. the errors that are most likely to grow. They have been used in predictability analysis and as initial perturbations for [[ensemble forecasting]] in [[numerical weather prediction]]. In modern practice they are often replaced by [[bred vector]]s for this purpose. ==Mathematical description==
