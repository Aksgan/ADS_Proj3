The SDK also supports older versions of the Android platform in case developers wish to target their applications at older devices. Development tools are downloadable components, so after one has downloaded the latest version and platform, older platforms and tools can also be downloaded for compatibility testing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/tools-notes.html |title=SDK Tools}}</ref> Android applications are packaged in [[APK (file format)|.apk]] format and stored under <code>/data/app</code> folder on the Android OS (the folder is accessible to root user only for security reasons).
