cases and details== Among other things, it means that a theory possessing a UV fixed point may not be an [[effective field theory]], because it is well-defined at arbitrarily small distance scales. At the UV fixed point itself, the theory can behave as a [[conformal field theory]]. The converse statement, that any [[quantum field theory|QFT]] which is valid at all distance scales (i.e. isn't an effective field theory) has a UV fixed point is false. See, for example, [[cascading gauge theory]]. [[noncommutative quantum field theory|Noncommutative quantum field theories]] have a UV cutoff even though they are not effective field theories. If the UV fixed point is [[trivial fixed point|trivial]] (aka Gaussian), we say that we have [[asymptotic freedom]]. If the UV fixed point is nontrivial, we say that we have "asymptotic safety". Theories with asymptotic safety may be well defined at all scales despite being [[nonrenormalizable]] in perturbative sense (according to the [[classical scaling dimension]]s). ==Asymptotic safety scenario in quantum gravity== Steven Weinberg has proposed<ref>{S. Weinberg. Ultraviolet Divergences In Quantum Theories Of Gravitation. In General Relativity: An Einstein centenary survey. Eds. S. W. Hawking and W. Israel, Cambridge University Press (1979), p.790}</ref> that gravity may satisfy asymptotic safety. http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0610018, http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2006-5/, http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2727, ==See also== *[[Ultraviolet divergence]] *[[Landau pole]] *[[Quantum triviality]] *[[Asymptotic Safety gravity]] ==References== {{{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Uv Fixed Point}} [[Category:Quantum field theory]] [[Category:Statistical mechanics]] [[Category:Conformal field theory]] [[Category:Renormalization group]] [[Category:Fixed points]] {{Quantum-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>38667</id> <title>UXu</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=uXu}} {{Infobox computer underground | group_name = Underground eXperts United | origin = [[Sweden]] | years_active = 1991&ndash;2002 | category = [[Underground ezine]] | founders = The Chief | members = Phearless<br />The GNN<br />Ralph 124C41+<br />Bravemoore<br />Joseph<br />Hedge<br />Eric Chaet<br />Ikonoklast<br />Leon Felkins<br />... and many more | }} '''uXu''', Underground eXperts United (1991-2002), [[underground ezine]] formed in Sweden by ex-members of the [[Swedish Hackers Association]], writing [[ASCII]] text files, influenced by [[Cult of the Dead Cow|cDc]].

''Founded in 1991, based in Sweden, uXu is a good example of a textfile endeavor where you can actually track the progression of a small social group through nearly a decade. The files begin with descriptions of the computer "scene" of Sweden, bombs, technology and eventually expands over the years to journal entries, musings about philosophy, song lyrics, interviews, and a bunch of nice fellows just letting you know what they're up to.

Starting in 2007, the company began offering a line of image export [[Plugin|plug-ins]] for [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]]. In 2008, Übermind entered the mobile application development market and introduced several iPhone apps, and in 2009 expanded onto the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform.
