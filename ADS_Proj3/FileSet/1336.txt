it is composite. Now, if the algorithm concludes that ''N'' is prime, then that means <math>S_1</math> satisfies the condition of Theorem 4, and so ''N'' is truly prime. There is an algorithm as well for when ''n'' is large, however for this we refer to the aforementioned article.<ref name="tsumura"/> ==References== <!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} {{Number-theoretic algorithms}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Elliptic Curve Primality Testing}} [[Category:Primality tests]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11992</id> <title>Elmer FEM solver</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = Elmer FEM solver | logo = [[Image:elmerlogo.png|Elmer logo|]] | screenshot = [[File:Elmer-fem-session.png|200px]] | caption = | collapsible = | author = | developer = | released = | latest release version = 5.4.1 | latest release date = February 29, 2008 | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = C++, Fortran | operating system = Cross platform | platform = | size = | language = | status = Active development | genre = | license = [[GNU General Public License]] | website = http://www.csc.fi/elmer }} {{Portal box|Free software|Electronics}} '''Elmer''' is an open source ([[GNU General Public License|GPL]]) computational tool for multi-[[physics]] problems. It has been developed by [[CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd|CSC]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer |title=Elmer - CSC |publisher=CSC — IT Center for Science Ltd |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> in collaboration with [[Finland|Finnish]] universities, research laboratories and industry. Elmer includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics, for example. These are described by partial differential equations which Elmer solves by the [[Finite Element Method]] (FEM). Elmer comprises several different parts: The boundary conditions and physical models are defined in ElmerGUI. The resulting problem definition is solved by ElmerSolver. Finally the results are visualized by ElmerPost. Additionally a utility ElmerGrid may be used for simple mesh manipulation. The different parts of Elmer software may also be used independently. The strongest of the components is ElmerSolver which includes many sophisticated features. For pre- and post-processing the users may find also other alternatives. The software runs on Unix and Windows platforms and can be compiled on a large variety of compilers. The solver can also be used in parallel mode on platforms that support [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]]. ==External links== *[http://www.csc.fi/elmer Elmer homepage] *[http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/elmer Elmer in Ubuntu Linux] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Elmer Fem Solver}} [[Category:Numerical software]] [[Category:Free computer-aided design software]] [[Category:Free science software]] [[Category:Linux Electronic Design Automation clients]] [[Category:Computational physics]] [[de:Elmer (Software)]] [[es:Elmer]] [[it:Elmer FEM solver]] [[ru:Elmer FEM solver]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11994</id> <title>Elonex</title> <text>{{Infobox Company | company_name = Elonex PLC | company_logo = | company_type = Private | foundation = 2007 | location = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | key_people = | founder = Stuart Smith | industry = Computer and related IT services | products = [[Elonex ONE|ONE]]<br/>[[Elonex ONEt|ONEt]] | revenue = | operating_income = | net_income = | num_employees = | parent = | subsid = | homepage = [http://www.elonex.com/ Official website] | footnotes = }} '''Elonex PLC''' is a computer hardware and related IT services company based in [[Coleshill, Warwickshire]], UK, that develops, sells and supports computers, consumer electronics and related IT services. The original Elonex brand was founded in 1986, in [[Finchley]], North London, by Israel Wetrin, and rapidly grew to become one of the UK's biggest computer hardware supplier by the mid-1990s. At its peak the company's turnover reached over £100 million per year.<ref name=PhillipsTimJuly2006>{{Citation | title = Elonex: the end of an era | url = http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2006/07/18/elonex_history/ | year = 18th July 2006 | author = Phillips, Tim | journal = The Register }}</ref> In 2006, Elonex voluntarily went into administration and the brand name Elonex was licensed to a subsidiary of office consumables supplier Applied Film Industries Company (Afic) for an undisclosed sum.

Stuart Smith confirmed that the only connection between his version of Elonex and the original company was simply that the famous brand was licensed for use in the UK for a specific period.The Elonex brand was then used for a number of sourced products for niche UK markets. None of Elonex's original technology and patents were purchased by Stuart Smith as all intellectual property was left with the International Holding company.<ref name=HailstoneMay2007>{{Citation | title = Elonex brand emerges again | url = http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn/news/2190294/elonex-brand-emerges-again | date = 21 May 2007 | author = Hailstone, Laura | journal = CRN Channel Web }}</ref> Today the company sells mainly [[Subnotebook|sub-notebook]] products, such as the [[Elonex ONE]] and [[Elonex ONEt]]; and consumer electronics, such as the [[Elonex 511EB]] [[eBook]] reader.
