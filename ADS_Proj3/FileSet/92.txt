These advertisements are administered by Google and generate revenue on either a [[Cost Per Click|per-click]] or [[Cost Per Impression|per-impression]] basis. Google [[beta-testing|beta tested]] a [[Cost Per Action|cost-per-action]] service, but discontinued it in October 2008 in favor of a [[DoubleClick]] offering (also owned by Google).<ref>[http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=97264 What happened to the pay-per-action beta?]</ref> In Q1 2010, Google earned US$2.04 billion ($8.16 billion annualized), or 30% of total revenue, through AdSense.<ref>[http://investor.google.com/earnings/2010/Q1_google_earnings.html "Google Announces First Quarter 2010 Financial Results"]. Google. Retrieved June 18, 2010.</ref> ==Overview== {{Ref improve section|date=September 2010}} Google uses its [[Internet search]] technology to serve advertisements based on website content, the user's geographical location, and other factors. Those wanting to advertise with Google's targeted advertisement system may enroll through [[AdWords]]. AdSense has become a popular method of placing advertising on a website because the advertisements are less intrusive than most [[banner ads|banners]], and the content of the advertisements is often relevant to the website. Many websites use AdSense to monetize their content; it is the most popular advertising network. AdSense has been particularly important for delivering advertising revenue to small websites that do not have the resources for developing advertising sales programs and sales people. To fill a website with advertisements that are relevant to the topics discussed, webmasters implement a brief script on the websites' pages. Websites that are content-rich have been very successful with this advertising program, as noted in a number of publisher case studies on the AdSense website. Some webmasters invest significant effort into maximizing their own AdSense income. They do this in three ways:{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} # They use a wide range of [[Web traffic|traffic]]-generating techniques, including but not limited to [[online advertising]]. # They build valuable content on their websites that attracts AdSense advertisements, which pay out the most when they are clicked. # They use text content on their websites that encourages visitors to click on advertisements. Note that Google prohibits webmasters from using phrases like "Click on my AdSense ads" to increase click rates. The phrases accepted are "Sponsored Links" and "Advertisements". The source of all AdSense income is the AdWords program, which in turn has a complex pricing model based on a [[Vickrey auction|Vickrey]] second price auction. AdSense commands an advertiser to submit a sealed bid (i.e., a bid not observable by competitors). Additionally, for any given click received, advertisers only pay one bid increment above the second-highest bid. Google currently shares 68% of revenues generated by AdSense with content network partners.<ref name="10QJul10">{{cite web | url=http://investor.google.com/documents/20100630_google_10Q.html | title=Google Form 10-Q, Q2 2010 | date=2010-07-15 | accessdate=2010-09-08}}</ref> ==History== Oingo, Inc., a privately held company located in Los Angeles, was started in 1998 by Gilad Elbaz and Adam Weissman.

According to the Official Google Blog, "advertisers have their ads placed in the most appropriate feed articles; publishers are paid for their original content; readers see relevant advertisingâ€”and in the long run, more quality feeds to choose from."<ref name="google_blog_feed_me">{{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/feed-me.html | title=Official Google Blog: Feed me | author=[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] | date=2005-05-17 | accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> AdSense for Feeds works by inserting images into a feed. When the image is displayed by a RSS reader or Web browser, Google writes the advertising content into the image that it returns. The advertisement content is chosen based on the content of the feed surrounding the image. When the user clicks the image, he or she is redirected to the advertiser's website in the same way as regular AdSense advertisements. AdSense for Feeds remained in its beta state until August 15, 2008, when it became available to all AdSense users. ===AdSense for search=== A companion to the regular AdSense program, '''AdSense
