which the corresponding power of two makes up part of the decomposition of the first multiplicand. The main advantage of this technique is that it makes use of only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by two. == Example == Here, in actual figures, is how 238 is multiplied by 13. The lines are multiplied by two, from one to the next. A check mark is placed by the powers of two in the decomposition of 13. {| border="0" |----- | ✓ || 1 || 238 |----- | || 2 || 476 |----- | ✓ || 4 || 952 |----- | ✓ || 8 || 1904 |----- | colspan="8" | <hr> |----- | || 13 || 3094 |} Since 13 = 8 + 4 + 1, distribution of multiplication over addition gives 13 × 238 = (8 + 4 + 1) × 238 = 8 x 238 + 4 × 238 + 1 × 238 = 1904 + 952 + 238 = 3094. == See also == *[[Egyptian mathematics]] *[[Multiplication algorithm]]s *[[Binary numeral system]] *[[Egyptian multiplication and division]] == External links == * [http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.peasant.html Russian Peasant Multiplication] * [http://www.lafstern.org/matt/col3.pdf The Russian Peasant Algorithm (pdf file)] * [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml Peasant Multiplication] from [[cut-the-knot]] * [http://ahmespapyrus.blogspot.com/2009/01/ahmes-papyrus-new-and-old.html] New and Old classifications of Ahmes Papyrus * [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/EgyptianMultiplication/ Egyptian Multiplication] by Ken Caviness, [[The Wolfram Demonstrations Project]]. * [http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Programming-Praxis-Russian-Peasant-Multiplication.aspx Russian Peasant Multiplication] at [[The Daily WTF]] {{number theoretic algorithms}} [[Category:Multiplication]] [[Category:Number theoretic algorithms]] [[de:Russische Bauernmultiplikation]] [[es:multiplicación por duplicación]] [[fr:Technique de multiplication dite russe]] [[fr:Technique de la multiplication en Égypte antique]] [[pt:Multiplicação por duplicação]] [[sr:Египатско множење]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1845</id> <title>Andrew Blake (scientist)</title> <text>'''Andrew Blake''', [[FREng]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], is a British scientist, a Deputy Managing Director at [[Microsoft Research]] Cambridge, Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|University of Edinburgh]], and a leading researcher in computer vision. ==Career== Andrew Blake graduated in 1977 from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] with a B.A. in Mathematics and Electrical Sciences. After a year as a [[Kennedy Scholar]] at [[MIT]] and two years in the defence electronics industry, he studied for a PhD at the [[University of Edinburgh]] which was awarded in 1983. Until 1987 he was on the faculty of the department of Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, as a Royal Society Research Fellow. From 1987 to 1999, he was on the academic staff of the Department of Engineering Science in the [[University of Oxford]], where he became a Professor in 1996, and was a Royal Society Senior Research Fellow for 1998-9. In 1999 he moved to Microsoft Research Cambridge as Senior Research Scientist, leading the Vision Group. ==Honours and awards== He was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in 1998, and [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 2005. In 2006 the Royal Academy of Engineering awarded him its Silver Medal. He has twice won the prize of the European Conference on Computer Vision, with R. Cipolla in 1992 and with M. Isard in 1996, and was awarded the [[IEEE]] [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] Prize (jointly with K. Toyama) in 2001. In 2007 he was awarded the [[Mountbatten Medal]]. In 2009 he was awarded the [[Computer Vision Significant Researcher Award]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. ==References== *[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/fellowslist.htm Royal Academy of Engineering Fellows] *[http://tab.computer.org/pamitc/conference/best-paper-awards.html Marr prize list] *[http://research.microsoft.com/cambridge/ Microsoft Research Cambridge] *[http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Andrew_Blake.html Andrew Blake, School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh] {{DEFAULTSORT:Blake, Andrew}} [[Category:Computer vision researchers]] [[Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni]] [[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge]] [[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]] [[Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh]] [[Category:Academics of the University of Oxford]] [[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]] [[Category:Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]] {{UK-scientist-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>1847</id> <title>Andrew Braybrook</title> <text>'''Andrew Braybrook''' is a [[software engineer]], a former [[game programmer]].
