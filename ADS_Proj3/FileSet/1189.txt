''.com'' domains. ''gatekeeper.dec.com'' was a well-known software repository during the pre-[[WWW|World Wide Web]] days, and Digital was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on October 1, [[1993]].<ref>[http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9402&L=dectei-l&T=0&P=200 DECTEI-L Archives – February 1994 (#2)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The popular [[AltaVista]], created by Digital, was one of the first comprehensive Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s. (Although [[Lycos]] was earlier, it was much more limited.) DEC invented [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes. Work on the first hard-disk-based [[MP3]]-player, the [[Personal Jukebox]], started at the [[DEC Systems Research Center]]. (The project was started about a month before the merger into [[Compaq]] was completed.) DEC's Western Research Lab created the [[Itsy Pocket Computer]]. This was developed into the Compaq [[iPaq]] line of [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, which replaced the [[Compaq Aero]] PDA. ==User organizations== Originally the [[users' group]] was called [[DECUS]] (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When [[Compaq]] acquired Digital in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] acquired [[Compaq]] in 2002, CUO became [[HP-Interex]], although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the [[United States]], the organization is represented by the [[Encompass]] organization. ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}} ==References== * (''Present''), [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/DEC%201957%20to%20Present%201978.pdf "Digital Equipment Corporation: Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present"], DEC Press, 1978 * David Donald Miller, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=s5lDmf3ANhEC "OpenVMS Operating System Concepts"], Elsevier, 1997 * Alan R.
