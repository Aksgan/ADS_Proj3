Bundled with a 15[[inch|"]] CRT monitor, keyboard, mouse and [[JBL]] stereo speakers, the 5460 was typical of the new range of multimedia PCs which debuted around the turn of the millennium. ==Specification== *475 MHz [[AMD]] K6-2 Processor *96 MB (96 [[mebibyte|MiB]]) PC133 SDRAM *6 GB (6 billion [[byte]]s) Hard Disk Drive *32x LG CD-ROM drive *[[Zip_drive|ZIP Drive]] *2 x USB 1.1 Ports *Soundblaster-compatible sound board (integrated within motherboard) *8 MB Ati Rage Graphics Card (onboard) The 5460 was preinstalled with Microsoft Windows 98 (first edition) which was available for reinstallation via the supplied [[QuickRestore]] Disc. ==Trivia== *The computer case was particularly difficult to open as customers were expected to bring the machine to a repair shop for hardware installation or support. It can be opened by removing the pads underneath the case and removing the screws (along with the more common screws in the back). *The 5460 came bundled with many Compaq utilities aimed at making the machine more user friendly. One of these was a construction worker, similar to Microsoft Office's [[Clippy]]. ==External links== * http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?lc=en&cc=us&lang=en&dlc=en&product=93364& - HP's official Presario 5460 site for Hardware support and drivers * http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc57/57751.htm - alternate 5460 specifications from RadioShack. {{microcompu-stub}} [[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7131</id> <title>Comparative case</title> <text>The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[Declension|grammatical case]] used in the [[Mari language]] to mark a likeness to something. It is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la') For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla'). It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. In this case, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case - usually, the suffix is not stressed. When used with languages, however, it is stressed. It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]]. ==References== * Зорина, З.
