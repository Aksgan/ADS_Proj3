Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Alexander Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Wiener Neustadt; he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tuition to pass the exam for the more technically oriented [[K.u.k.]] [[Realschule]] in [[Linz]], a small state school with 300 pupils, and according to Brian McGuinness a stronghold of German nationalism.<ref name=Waugh33>Waugh, p. 33. *McGuinness, Brian.

Certainly the Wittgenstein children were aware of their ancestry. Paul had created a family tree showing their descent from the Chief Rabbi [[Samson Wertheimer]] (1678–1724), the banker [[Samuel Oppenheimer]] (1678–1724), and the composers [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] (1791–1864) and [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (1809–1847). There was nevertheless a streak of antisemitism among them. Wittgenstein famously compared the Jewish people to a ''Beule'' (boil or tumour) on Austrian society.<ref>Stern, David.
