Fillmore|Fillmore]] et al. 2003, Section 3.4). The term '''null''' refers to the fact that the frame element in question is absent. The logical object of the term '''instantiation''' refers to the frame element itself. So, '''null instantiation''' is the instantiation of a frame element with a null value. ==Definite null instantiation== Definite null instantiation is the absence of a frame element that is recoverable from the context. It is similar to a [[Zero anaphor|zero]] [[anaphor]]. ==Indefinite null instantiation== Indefinite null instantiation is the absence of the object of a potentially [[transitive verb]] such as ''eat'' or ''drink.'' ==Constructional null instantiation== Constructional null instantiation is the absence of a frame element due to a syntactic construction, e.g. the optional omission of agents in passive sentences. ==References== # [[Charles J.
