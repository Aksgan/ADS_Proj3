Development of the Newton platform started in 1987<!-- See Apple confidential 2.0 by O. Linzmayer --> and officially ended on February 27, 1998. Some electronic engineering and the manufacture of Apple's Newton devices was done in Japan by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]. Most Newton devices were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor and all featured [[handwriting recognition]] software. Most Newton devices were developed and marketed by Apple (this includes the whole [[MessagePad]] line and the [[eMate 300]]), but other companies, notably Sharp, [[Motorola]], and [[Digital Ocean]], also released devices that ran the [[Newton OS]]. None were as successful as Apple's devices. [[File:Newton Lewt (2200371795).jpg|thumb|right|Three Newton MessagePad devices with keyboard and LinearFlash PCMCIA memory card accessories.]] == Development == The Newton project was a PDA platform. The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the phrase "[[personal digital assistant]]" was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's CEO [[John Sculley]],<ref>[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-newton-origin.html The Story Behind Apple's Newton], Tom Hormby - 2006.02.07, Low End Mac</ref> the driving force behind the project. Newton was intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing. For most of its design lifecycle Newton had a large-format screen, more internal memory, and an object-oriented graphics kernel. One of the original motivating [[use case]]s for the design was known as the "Architect Scenario", in which Newton's designers imagined a residential [[architect]] working quickly with a client to sketch, clean up, and interactively modify a simple two-dimensional home plan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There is however an extensive history of [[pen computing]] that predates the Newton, though not generally in the form factor of what would now be called a PDA. For a portion of the Newton's development cycle (roughly the middle third<!--exact dates?-->), the project's intended programming language was [[Dylan programming language|Dylan]] though in fact the language and environment never matured enough for any applications to be successfully written.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Dylan was a small, efficient [[object-oriented]] [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] variant that still retains some interest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Although it was efficient (for its day, and considering its substantial run-time [[dynamic programming language|dynamism]]),{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Dylan never lived up to its developers' performance expectations and was a tough sell for a development team unaccustomed to Lisp programming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} When the move was made to a smaller form factor (designed by [[Jonathan Ive]]),<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_39/b4002414.htm "Who Is Jonathan Ive?"], BusinessWeek</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/digital/cyberelite/44.html "cyber elite: Jonathan Ive"], Time</ref> Dylan was relegated to experimental status in the "Bauhaus Project" and eventually canceled outright. Its replacement, NewtonScript, had garbage collection, tight integration with the "soup" storage and user-interface toolkit, and was specifically designed to run in small RAM/large ROM environments. It was mostly developed by Walter Smith from 1992 to 1993. The project missed its original goals to reinvent personal computing,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and then to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] contemporary application programming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Newton project fell victim to project slippage, [[scope creep]], and a growing fear that it would interfere with Macintosh sales. It was reinvented as a PDA platform which would be a complementary Macintosh peripheral instead of a stand-alone computer which might compete with the Macintosh. Although [[PDA]]s had been developing since the original [[Psion Organiser]] in 1984,<ref>[http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/aSGuest22971-219207-pda-enter-tags-rohith-girish-shyamprasad-entertainment-ppt-powerpoint/ ISAS seminar on PDAs]</ref><ref name="PDA history blog">[http://www.bloggersbase.com/gadgets-and-Mobile/history-of-pdas-part-1/ History of PDAs blog]</ref> the Newton has left one particular lasting impression: the term ''personal digital assistant'' was first coined to refer to the Newton.<ref name="PDA history blog"/> John Sculley says Apple invested approximately US$100M to develop Newton.<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/2008-7351-5085423.html] [[Cnet]]</ref> == Product details == ==== Hardware models ==== * [[MessagePad|MessagePad 100]] (also known as the H1000, OMP or Original MessagePad) [[File:Apple Newton MP100.jpg|thumb|right|upright|MP100]] * [[MessagePad|MessagePad 110]] * [[MessagePad|MessagePad 120]] * [[MessagePad|MessagePad 130]] * [[eMate 300]] [[File:Applenewton emate300.jpg|thumb|right|upright|eMate 300]] * [[MessagePad|MessagePad 2000]] [[File:Apple Newton.jpg|thumb|right|upright|MP2000]] * [[MessagePad|MessagePad 2100]] === Application software === <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Controlpanelnewton.png|thumb|right|''The [[Newton OS]] GUI'']] --> Most Newton devices were pre-loaded with a variety of software to help in personal data organization and management. This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc), time-zone maps, etc. In later/2.x versions of the [[Newton OS]] these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled [[Third-party developer|3rd party]] applications, such as the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a "lite" version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket [[Quicken]], the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client. Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and [[Personal information manager|PIM (Personal Information Manager)]] application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled [[Apple Newton Software|Newton Connection Utilities]] and also the Newton Connection Kit, which was sold separately and only worked for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the Newton OS. ====Notes==== The Notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed, or that had been recognized from handwriting, as well as free-hand sketches, [[Apple Newton#User interface|"Shapes", and "ink text"]]. [[Image:Apple newton messagepad checklist jk.jpg|left|thumbnail|Photograph of screen displaying Checklist, some bullet points [[Tick (checkmark)|checked]] and/or "collapsed"]] In version 2.0 of the [[Newton OS]], the Notes application (as well as Names) could accept what Apple termed "stationery", 3rd-party created plug-in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications. One of the new types of Notes stationery added to Newton OS 2.0 was a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Bullet point|bullet-ed]], collapsible, multi-line "[[Checklist]]", an implementation of [[outliner]] software. This could be used for organizing thoughts, priorities, [[Time management|"to do" lists]], planning steps and sub-tasks, etc. Each
