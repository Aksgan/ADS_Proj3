promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists, led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other veterans, feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts. Calling themselves "Federalists," the nationalists convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787.<ref>Richard B.

Though contemporary participants referred to the events as "the revolution",<ref>David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2001)</ref> at one end of the spectrum is the view that the American Revolution was not "revolutionary" at all, contending that it did not radically transform colonial society but simply replaced a distant government with a local one.<ref>Greene, ''The American Revolution'' (2000) pp. 93-102</ref> More recent scholarship pioneered by historians such as [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]], and [[Edmund Morgan]] accepts the contemporary view of the participants that the American Revolution was a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound impact on world affairs, based on an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment as reflected in how liberalism was understood during the period, and republicanism. These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people.<ref>Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)</ref> ===Loyalist expatriation=== About 60,000 to 70,000 Loyalists left the newly founded republic; some left for Britain and the remainder, called [[United Empire Loyalists]] received British subsidies to resettle in British colonies in North America, especially [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] (concentrating in the [[Eastern Townships]]), [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>W. Stewart Wallace, '';The United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration'' (Toronto, 1914) [http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm online edition]</ref> The new colonies of Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]) and [[New Brunswick]] were created by Britain for their benefit. However, about 80% of the Loyalists stayed and became loyal citizens of the United States, and some of the exiles later returned to the U.S.<ref>Van Tine, ''American Loyalists'' (1902) p 307</ref> ===As an example or inspiration=== {{See|Atlantic Revolutions}} After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible.<ref>Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 278-9</ref> The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Thus came the widespread assertion of liberty, individual rights, equality and hostility toward corruption which would prove core values of liberal republicanism to Americans. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the [[consent of the governed]]. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of [[democracy|democratically]] elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with [[Direct election|directly elected]] representative government.<ref>Palmer, (1959)</ref> The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain at that time, was the next country after France to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/> On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]], representing King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and Benjamin Franklin, [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America]], signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the U.S.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/> The American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]] that took hold in the French Revolution, the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the Netherlands.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) ch 53–55</ref> The Revolution had a strong, immediate impact in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] spoke in favor of the American cause. The Revolution, along with the [[Dutch Revolt]] (end of the 16th century) and the [[English Civil War]] (in the 17th century), was one of the first lessons in overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as [[Marquis de Lafayette]]. The American Declaration of Independence had some impact on the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 49–52</ref><ref>Center for History and New Media, ''Liberty, equality, fraternity'' (2010)</ref> The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804—long before the British Parliament acted in 1833 to abolish slavery in its colonies.<ref>Greene and Pole p. 409, 453-54</ref> ===National debt=== {{See|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}} The national debt after the American Revolution fell into three categories. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners—mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually. The war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government.<ref>Jensen, ''The New Nation'' (1950) p. 379</ref> In 1790, at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts
