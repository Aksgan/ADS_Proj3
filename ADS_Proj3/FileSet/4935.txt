Early platforms to feature zombie games included the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, which featured a game entitled [[Zombies Ate My Neighbors]] that was produced in 1993. Outside of video games, zombies frequently appear in [[collectible card game|trading card games]] such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', as well as in role-playing games such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and tabletop wargames such as [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer Fantasy]] and [[Warhammer 40,000|40K]].
