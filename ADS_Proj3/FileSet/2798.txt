Each spacecraft consists of several components: * Rover: 185 kg (408 lb) * Lander: 348 kg (767 lb) * Backshell / Parachute: 209 kg (461 lb) * Heat Shield: 78 kg (172 lb) * Cruise Stage: 193 kg (425 lb) * Propellant: 50 kg (110 lb) * Instruments: 5 kg (11 lb)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5280r1m6170325m/fulltext.pdf?page=1|title=Spirit and Opportunity: Wheels on Mars|accessdate=2010-07-22|publisher=SpringerLink}}</ref> Total mass is 1,063 kg (2,343 lb). ===Cruise stage=== The cruise stage is the component of the spacecraft that is used for travel from Earth to Mars. It is very similar to the Mars Pathfinder in design and is approximately 2.65 [[metre|meters]] (8.7 ft) in [[diameter]] and 1.6 m (5.2 ft) tall, including the entry vehicle (see below). The primary structure is [[aluminium]] with an outer ring of ribs covered by the [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, which are about 2.65 m (8.7 ft) in diameter. Divided into five sections, the solar arrays can provide up to 600 [[watt]]s of power near Earth and 300 W at Mars. Heaters and [[multi-layer insulation]] keep the electronics "warm". A [[freon]] system removes heat from the flight computer and communications hardware inside the rover so they do not overheat. Cruise avionics systems allow the flight computer to interface with other electronics, such as the sun sensors, star scanner and heaters. ====Navigation==== The star scanner (with a backup system) and [[sun sensor]] allowed the spacecraft to know its orientation in space by analyzing the position of the Sun and other stars in relation to itself. Sometimes the craft could be slightly off course; this was expected, given the 500 million kilometer (320 million mile) journey. Thus navigators planned up to six trajectory correction maneuvers, along with health checks. To ensure the spacecraft arrived at Mars in the right place for its landing, two light-weight, aluminium-lined tanks carried about 31 kg (about 68 lb) of [[hydrazine]] [[propellant]]. Along with cruise guidance and control systems, the propellant allowed navigators to keep the spacecraft on course. Burns and pulse firings of the propellant allowed three types of maneuvers: * An axial burn uses pairs of thrusters to change spacecraft velocity; * A lateral burn uses two "thruster clusters" (four thrusters per cluster) to move the spacecraft "sideways" through seconds-long pulses; * Pulse mode firing uses coupled thruster pairs for spacecraft [[precession]] maneuvers (turns). ====Communication==== The spacecraft used a high-frequency [[X band]] [[radio]] [[wavelength]] to communicate, which allowed for less power and smaller [[antenna (electronics)|antennas]] than many older craft, which used [[S band]]. Navigators sent commands through two antennas on the cruise stage: a '''cruise [[low-gain antenna]]''' mounted inside the inner ring, and a '''cruise medium-gain antenna''' in the outer ring. The low-gain antenna was used close to Earth. It is omni-directional, so the transmission power that reached Earth fell faster with increasing distance. As the craft moved closer to Mars, the Sun and Earth moved closer in the sky as viewed from the craft, so less energy reached Earth. The spacecraft then switched to the medium-gain antenna, which directed the same amount of transmission power into a tighter beam toward Earth. During flight, the spacecraft was [[gyroscope|spin-stabilized]] with a spin rate of two [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm). Periodic updates kept antennas pointed toward Earth and solar panels toward the Sun. ===Aeroshell=== The aeroshell maintained a protective covering for the lander during the seven month voyage to Mars. Together with the lander and the rover, it constituted the "entry vehicle". Its main purpose was to protect the lander and the rover inside it from the intense heat of entry into the thin Martian atmosphere. It was based on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Viking designs. ====Parts==== The aeroshell was made of two main parts: a [[heat shield]] and a backshell. The heat shield was flat and brownish, and protected the lander and rover during entry into the Martian atmosphere and acted as the first [[aerobrake]] for the spacecraft. The backshell was large, cone-shaped and painted white. It carried the [[parachute]] and several components used in later stages of entry, descent, and landing, including: * A parachute (stowed at the top of the backshell); * The backshell electronics and batteries that fire off pyrotechnic devices like separation nuts, rockets and the parachute mortar; * A Litton LN-200 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which monitors and reports the orientation of the backshell as it swings under the parachute; * Three large [[solid rocket]] motors called RAD rockets (Rocket Assisted
