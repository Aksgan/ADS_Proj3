generally referred to by the model of their CPU, like "KA10". Later upgrades produced the compatible [[DECSYSTEM-20]], along with [[TOPS-20]] that included [[virtual memory]]. One of the most unusual peripherals produced for the PDP-10 was the [[DECtape]]. The DECtape was a length of standard magnetic tape wound on 5-in reels. However, the recording format was a 10-track approach using fixed-length numbered 'blocks' organized into a standard file structure, including a directory. Files could be written, read, changed, and deleted on a DECtape as though it were a disk. In fact, some PDP-10 systems had no disks at all, using DECtapes alone for their primary data storage. For greater efficiency, the DECtape drive could read and write to a DECtape in both directions. ===PDP-11=== In 1968 DEC was working on a PDP machine that would be based on 8-bit [[byte]]s instead of 6-bit characters. Known as the "PDP-X", the project was eventually cancelled. Several team members decamped and set up [[Data General]] in May 1968, and rapidly brought the 16-bit [[Data General Nova|NOVA]] minicomputer to market. DEC immediately found itself behind in the industry transition to 8-bit bytes, and soon lost its crown as the largest minicomputer vendor. The [[PDP-11]] 16-bit computer was designed in a crash program by Harold McFarland, [[Gordon Bell]], Roger Cady, and others.<ref name=birth>Larry McGowan, [http://hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html "How the PDP-11 Was Born (according to Larry McGowan)], 19 August 1998</ref> The project was able to leap forward in design with the arrival of Harold McFarland, who had been researching 16-bit designs at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. One of his simpler designs became the PDP-11, although when they first presented it, management was not impressed and almost cancelled it.<ref name=birth/> In particular, the new design did not include many of the addressing modes that were intended to make programs smaller in memory, a technique that was widely used on other DEC machines and [[CISC]] designs in general. This would mean the machine would spend more time accessing memory, which would slow it down. However, the machine also introduced the idea of "General Registers", which gave the programmer flexibility to use these high-speed memory caches as they needed, potentially addressing the performance issues. A major advance in the PDP-11 design was [[UNIBUS]], which supported all peripherals through [[memory mapping]]. This allowed new devices to be added easily, generally only requiring some sort of hardware interface and then writing software that examined the mapped memory to control them. This spawned a huge market of 3rd party add-ons for the PDP-11, which made the machine even more useful. Its numerous architectural innovations proved superior to all competitors and the "11" architecture was soon the industry leader, propelling DEC back to their leadership position. The design was later expanded to allow [[Paging|paged physical memory]] and [[memory protection]] features, useful for [[multitasking]] and [[time-sharing]], and some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128 kB within a physical address size of up to 4 MB. PDP-11s, implemented as single-chip CPUs, continued to be produced until 1996, by which time over 600,000 had been sold.<ref name=miller452/> The PDP-11 supported several operating systems, including [[Bell Labs|Bell Labs']] new [[Unix]] operating system as well as DEC's [[DOS-11]], [[RSX-11]], IAS, [[RT-11]], DSM-11, and [[RSTS/E]]. Many early PDP-11 applications were developed using standalone paper-tape utilities. DOS-11 was the PDP-11's first disk operating system, but was soon supplanted by more capable systems. RSX provided a general-purpose [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] environment and supported a wide variety of [[programming language]]s. IAS was a [[time-sharing]] version of RSX-11D. Both RSTS and Unix were time-sharing systems available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the sandbox for a generation of engineers and computer scientists. Large numbers of 11/70s were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications. AT&T became DEC's largest customer. RT-11 provided a practical real-time operating system, allowing the PDP-11 to continue Digital's critical role as a computer supplier for [[embedded system]]s. RT-11 served as the inspiration for many microcomputer OS's, as these were generally being written by programmers who cut their teeth on one of the many PDP-11 models. [[CP/M]] used a command syntax similar to RT-11's, and even retained the awkward [[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]] program used to copy other programs. DEC's use of "/" for "switches" (command-line options) would lead to the adoption of "\" for pathnames in [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] as opposed to "/" in [[Unix]].<ref name="afu-faq">[http://www.netwhatever.com/faq/inicio.html#queIII15 alt.folklore.computers List of Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> The evolution of the PDP-11 followed earlier systems, eventually evolving into a single-user deskside [[personal computer]] form in the microPDP. 600,000 PDP-11's of all models were eventually sold. Many PDP-11-like machines were also introduced, and a wide variety of peripheral vendors entered the ecosystem. The PDP-11 series was cloned in [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance|COMECON]] countries as the [[SM EVM]] series, and was produced in quantities comparable to original PDP-11 production. ===VAX=== [[Image:Vax780 small.jpeg|thumb|right|A representative VAX-11/780 system configuration]] In 1976, DEC decided to extend the [[PDP-11]] architecture to [[32-bit]]s while adding a complete [[virtual memory]] system to the simple paging and memory protection of the PDP-11. The result was the [[VAX]] architecture. The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the [[VAX-11/780]], which DEC referred to as a ''[[superminicomputer]]''. Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780's combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its [[Jupiter project]], which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as their the single computer architecture for the company.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=W7skAQAAIAAJ&q=dec+Jupiter+project+vax&dq=dec+Jupiter+project+vax&client=safari&cd=4 "The day Jupiter went out of orbit"], ''Electronic Business'', Volume 10 (1984), pg. 76â€“79</ref> Supporting the VAX's success was the [[VT52]], one of the most successful [[smart terminal]]s. Building on earlier less successful models (the [[VT05]] and [[VT50]]), the VT52 was the first terminal that did everything one might
