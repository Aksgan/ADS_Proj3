technician|orthodontic technician]]s began to hold meetings in 1971 to discuss the regulation of orthodontic technology and the ways in which standards in the profession could be improved. This resulted in the first conference, held in April 1973. ==Logo== [[File:Former OTA logo.JPG|thumb|120px|right|The Original OTA logo]] The OTA logo is circular in shape and depicts the letters OTA with an otter, the mascot of the Orthodontic Technicians Association. The otter is the association's mascot because of the possible pronunciation of OTA as "otter." The perimeter of the logo is encircled with the words "Orthodontic Technicians Association." Previously, the logo was based on the base of a maxillary [[Edward Angle|Angle’s]] trimmed study model ==Current activities== The aims of the association are to encourage the study, promote the highest standards of practice, and advance the knowledge of orthodontic laboratory and clinical techniques for the benefit of the orthodontic team and patient. The OTA advises institutions and individuals on the use of all orthodontic laboratory techniques and the service that is provided by orthodontic technicians. The association organizes an independent annual meeting, as well as an autumn meeting at the British Orthodontic Conference. OTA is also represented at the biannual Dental Technology Show in the [[Ricoh Arena]] in [[Coventry]]. ==Membership== The association has the following grades of membership: *Associate Members: Students and persons supporting the association that do not meet the requirements of full membership. *Members: Persons who hold a current UK [[General Dental Council]] registration as a Dental Technician or equivalent. *Licentiates: Members who have shown distinguished ability or originality in the science of orthodontic laboratory techniques, or who have been of service to the orthodontic profession. *Fellows: members or past members recognized either for many years of service to orthodontic technology or distinguished ability or originality in this field. *Honorary Members and Life Members: Any member of long standing who has made a notable contribution to the association’s affairs or to orthodontics, including members who have reached retirement age, but still wish to be involved with the affairs of the Association. *Retired Members *International Members ==Publications== [[File:OTA Conference Proceedings 2004.jpg|thumb|130px|right|A copy of the OTA Conference Proceedings from 2004]] Since 1998 the OTA have published conference proceedings to accompany the association's conference, containing full articles relating to the lectures presented at the conference. It is edited by OTA council member John Brown. The association also publishes a quarterly newsletter to keep members up to date with news relating to orthodontic technology. In addition, the newsletter of the British Orthodontic Society, ''BOS News'', contains four pages of news relating to OTA. ==Awards== Together with the British Orthodontic Society, OTA recognizes promising students (British Orthodontic Society Technicians Award) and honours distinguished service of orthodontic technicians (British Orthodontic Society Award to an Orthodontic Technician for Distinguished Service). The British Orthodontic Society Award to an Orthodontic Technician for Distinguished Service is awarded annually to an orthodontic technician who has made an outstanding contribution to the field of orthodontics. The Aldridge Medal for the best lecture given at the conference was launched in 2007. ==External links== {{commoncat|Orthodontic Technicians Association}} *[http://www.bos.org.uk/aboutbos/affiliatedorganisations/ota.htm OTA page on the British Orthodontic Society website] bos.org.uk *[http://www.dta-uk.org/gdcquotes.php OTA's response to news of statutory registration] dta-uk.org {{Orthodontology}} {{Cleft lip and palate}} [[Category:British dental organisations]] [[Category:British professional bodies]] [[Category:Great Ormond Street Hospital]] [[Category:Health and medicine related organisations in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Health in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Non-profit organisations based in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Organizations established in 1971]] [[Category:Orthodontic Technicians Association]] [[Category:Technicians]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27833</id> <title>Orthogonality (programming)</title> <text>{{orphan|date=August 2009}} {{Wikify|date=August 2009}} '''Orthogonality''' in a programming language means that a relatively small set of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to build the control and data structures of the language. The term is most frequently used with regards to assembly instruction sets, as [[orthogonal instruction set]]. == Orthogonality Concept == Orthogonality is a very important concept. It addresses how relatively small number of components that can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to get the desired results. It is closely associated with simplicity: the more orthogonal the design the fewer exceptions and it makes it easier to learn, read, and write programs in a programming language. The meaning of an orthogonal feature is independent of the context. The key parameters are symmetry and consistency. For example pointers is an orthogonal concept. Here is one example from IBM Mainframe and VAX that highlights this concept. In IBM main frame has two different instructions for adding the contents of a register to a memory cell or another register. These statements are shown below: :A Reg1, memory_cell :AR Reg1, Reg2 In the first case, contents of Reg1 are added to the contents of a memory cell and the result is stored in Reg1; in the second case contents of Reg1 are added to the contents of another register (Reg2) and the result is stored in Reg1. In contrast to the above set of statement, VAX has only one statement for addition as shown below: <nowiki>ADDL operand1, operand2</nowiki> In this case the two operands, operand1 and operand2, can be registers, memory cells, or a combination of both and the instruction simply adds the contents of operand1 to the contents of operand2 and store the result in operand1. It can be easily seen that the VAX’s instruction for addition is more orthogonal than the instructions provided by IBM and hence it is easier for the programmer to remember and use it as compared to the one provided by IBM. Let us now study the design of C language from the perspective of orthogonality. We can easily see that C language is not very consistent in its treatment of different concepts and language structure and hence makes it difficult for the user to learn and use the language. Here are a few examples of exceptions: • You can return structures but not arrays from a function • An array can be returned if it is inside a structure • A member
