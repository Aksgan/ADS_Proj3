It is often used to measure the change induced by a particular treatment or event, though may be subject to certain biases ([[mean reversion]] bias, etc.). In contrast to a within-subjects estimate of the treatment effect (that measures the difference in an outcome after and before treatment) or a between-subjects estimate of the treatment effect (that measures the difference in an outcome between the treatment and control groups), the DID estimator represents the difference between the pre-post, within-subjects differences of the treatment and control groups. The basic premise of DID is to examine the effect of some sort of [[Experiment|treatment]] by comparing the treatment group after treatment both to the treatment group before treatment and to some other control group. Naively, you might consider simply looking at the treatment group before and after treatment to try to deduce the effect of the treatment. However, a lot of other things were surely going on at exactly the same time as the treatment. DID uses a control group to subtract out other changes at the same time, assuming that these other changers were identical between the treatment and control groups. (The [[Achilles' heel]] of DID is when something else changes between the two groups at the same time as the treatment.) For it to be an accurate estimation, we must also assume that the composition of the two groups remains the same over the course of the treatment. Also we need to consider the possible serial correlation issues. ==Hypothetical example== Consider this example:<ref>[http://healthcare-economist.com/2006/02/11/difference-in-difference-estimation/ Difference in Difference Estimation]</ref> state A passes a bill offering tax deduction to employers providing health insurance. Let us also consider that in the year after the bill passed (year 2) the percentage of firms offering health insurance increased by 30% compared to the year before the bill was passed (year 1). To estimate the impact of the bill on the percentage of firms offering health insurance, we could simply do a ''before and after'' analysis and conclude that the bill increased insurance offerings by 30%. The problem is that there could be a trend over time for more employers to offer insurance. It is impossible to identify if the tax deductibility or the time trend caused this increase in firm offering. One way to identify the impact of the bill is to run a DID regression. If there is a state B that did not change the way it treated employer provided health insurance, we could use this as a [[control group]] to compare the changes between A and B between the two years. We will run the [[Linear regression|regression]]: : <math>Y= \beta_0 + \beta_1 *T + \beta_2 *SA + \beta_3 *(T*SA) + \varepsilon</math> where ''Y'' is the percentage of firms offering health insurance in each state in each time period. ''T'' is a time dummy, SA is a state dummy for state ''A'', and ''T''*''SA'' is the interaction of the time dummy and the state ''A'' dummy. The chart below displays the percentage of firms offering insurance in each state and time period. {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- ! ! State A ! State B |- | Year 1 | b | a |- | Year 2 | d | c |} The next chart explains what each coefficient in the regression represents. {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- ! Coefficient ! Calculation |- | <math>\beta_0</math> | ''a'' |- | <math>\beta_1</math> | ''c'' &minus; ''a'' |- | <math>\beta_2</math> | ''b'' &minus; ''a'' |- | <math>\beta_3</math> | (''d'' &minus; ''b'') &minus; (''c'' &minus; ''a'') |} We can see that <math>\beta_{0}</math> is the baseline average, <math>\beta_{1}</math> represents the time trend in the control group, <math>\beta_{2}</math> represents the differences between the two states in year 1, and <math>\beta_{3}</math> represents the difference in the changes over time. Assuming that both states have the same health insurance trends over time, we have now controlled for a possible national time trend. We can now identify what the true impact of the tax deductibility is on employers offering insurance. ==Real example== Consider one of the more famous DID studies, Card and Krueger article on [[minimum wage]] in New Jersey, published in September 1994.<ref>[http://www.krueger.princeton.edu/90051397.pdf David Card and Alan B. Krueger, "Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania," American Economic Review, v. 84, n. 4 (September 1994), pp. 774&ndash;775.]</ref> Card and Krueger are looking at the effect of an April 1, 1992 increase in NJ's minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05. They collect data on fast food employment before (February) and after (November) the change. In NJ, average employment per restaurant
