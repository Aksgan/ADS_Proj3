Major Lasswell USMC in Hawaii decrypted the Japanese Naval message first and Captain Layton (Pacific Fleet Intelligence in Hawaii) gave it to Admiral Nimitz who authorized a shootdown attempt after determining from ComNavAirSoPac that it could be done with by one of his Army Air Corp units on Guadalcanal.

The subject areas include: [[anthropology]], [[culture]] and [[society]], [[economy]], [[gender studies]], [[history]], [[Judaic studies]], [[fine arts]], [[literature]], [[linguistics]], [[political| political sciences]] and [[social sciences]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], reviews, etc. C.E.E.O.L. is initiated and maintained by Questa.Soft GmbH in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which is a software development company, founded in 1998 by two partners, Wolfgang Klotz and Aurelian Urzica. From the very beginning, the company started to build up the technical and logistical basis for the future operation of C.E.E.O.L. In 2000 the company completed the development of a content management pilot project and offered publishers from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] a platform for the online distribution of their publications—C.E.E.O.L. C.E.E.O.L. may be seen as an heir of the East/West European Cultural Centre “Palais Jalta” in [[Frankfurt am Main]] which, for the twelve year period from 1991 to 2003, attempted primarily to balance the flow of information from West to East with a significant counter current in the opposite direction. C.E.E.O.L., as the “virtual successor” of “Palais Jalta”, shares this aim and continues this work on a global scale via the Internet.<ref> Bea Klotz, The Central and Eastern European Online Library (http://www.ceeol.com), in: The Serials Librarian, Volume 53, Issue 1 & 2 August 2007 , pages 191–201</ref> As a logical enhancement of C.E.E.O.L. and following numerous requests from C.E.E.O.L.’s partner publishers, Questa.Soft GmbH decided to provide the Eastern European publishers with an additional online platform DiBiDo dedicated to e-books from and about Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe, covering the same subject, language and geographic areas as the periodical database. The DiBiDo platform allows the participating publishers to distribute their books in digital format, to readers from across the world.<ref> Bea Klotz, Recent Developments at the Central and Eastern European Online Library (http://www.ceeol.com/), in: Slavic & East European Information Resources, Volume 10, Issue 1 January 2009, pages 95–101</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * Robert Murray Davis, East Goes West.

The CCG[http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk] was opened in 1993, and builds on over 40 years experience in [[spatial analysis]] and [[computer model|modelling]] within the [[School of Geography, University of Leeds|School of Geography]].

This system gives the users both implicit and explicit certification, the certificate can be used as a conventional certificate (for signatures, etc.), but also implicitly for the purpose of encryption. ==Example== A user ''Alice'' can doubly encrypt a message using another user's (''Bob'') public key and his (''Bob's'') identity. This means that the user (''Bob'') cannot decrypt it without a currently valid certificate and also that the certificate authority cannot decrypt the message as they don't have the user's private key (i.e., there is no implicit [[escrow]] as with ID-based cryptography, as the double encryption means they cannot decrypt it solely with the information they have). ==Key revocation== [[Key revocation]] can be added to the system by requiring a new certificate to be issued as frequently as the
