on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by [[Jan Lukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, [[Stanisław Jaśkowski|Jaśkowski]] made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction, first in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updating his proposal in a sequence of papers in 1934 and 1935. His proposals led to different notations such as [[Fitch-style calculus]] (or Fitch's diagrams) or [[Patrick Suppes|Suppes]]' method of which e.g. [[John Lemmon|Lemmon]] gave a variant called [[system L (Lemmon)|system L]]. Natural deduction in its modern form was independently proposed by the German mathematician [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gentzen]] in 1935, in a dissertation delivered to the faculty of mathematical sciences of the university of Göttingen. The term ''natural deduction'' (or rather, its German equivalent ''natürliches Schließen'') was coined in that paper: {{quote|Ich wollte zunächst einmal einen Formalismus aufstellen, der dem wirklichen Schließen möglichst nahe kommt. So ergab sich ein „Kalkül des natürlichen Schließens“.<br/> (First I wished to construct a formalism that comes as close as possible to actual reasoning. Thus arose a "calculus of natural deduction".)|Gentzen, ''Untersuchungen über das logische Schließen'' (Mathematische Zeitschrift 39, pp.176–210, 1935)}} Gentzen was motivated by a desire to establish the consistency of number theory, and he found immediate use for his natural deduction calculus. He was nevertheless dissatisfied with the complexity of his proofs, and in 1938 gave a new consistency proof using his [[sequent calculus]]. In a series of seminars in 1961 and 1962 [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]] gave a comprehensive summary of natural deduction calculi, and transported much of Gentzen's work with sequent calculi into the natural deduction framework. His 1965 monograph ''Natural deduction: a proof-theoretical study'' was to become a reference work on natural deduction, and included applications for [[modal logic|modal]] and [[second-order logic]]. In natural deduction, a [[proposition]] is deduced from a collection of premises by applying inference rules repeatedly. The system presented in this article is a minor variation of Gentzen's or Prawitz's formulation, but with a closer adherence to [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]]'s description of logical judgments and connectives (Martin-Löf, 1996). ==Judgments and propositions== A ''[[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgment]]'' is something that is knowable, that is, an object of knowledge. It is ''evident'' if one in fact knows it. Thus "''it is raining''" is a judgment, which is evident for the one who knows that it is actually raining; in this case one may readily find evidence for the judgment by looking outside the window or stepping out of the house. In mathematical logic however, evidence is often not as directly observable, but rather deduced from more basic evident judgments. The process of deduction is what constitutes a ''proof''; in other words, a judgment is evident if one has a proof for it. The most important judgments in logic are of the form "''A is true''". The letter ''A'' stands for any expression representing a ''proposition''; the truth judgments thus require a more primitive judgment: "''A is a proposition''". Many other judgments have been studied; for example, "''A is false''" (see [[classical logic]]), "''A is true at time t''" (see [[temporal logic]]), "''A is necessarily true''" or "''A is possibly true''" (see [[modal logic]]), "''the program M has type τ''" (see [[programming language]]s and [[type theory]]), "''A is achievable from the available resources''" (see [[linear logic]]), and many others. To start with, we shall concern ourselves with the simplest two judgments "''A is a proposition''" and "''A is true''", abbreviated as "''A'' prop" and "''A'' true" respectively. The judgment "''A'' prop" defines the structure of valid proofs of ''A'', which in turn defines the structure of propositions. For this reason, the [[inference rule]]s for this judgment are sometimes known as ''formation rules''. To illustrate, if we have two propositions ''A'' and ''B'' (that is, the judgments "''A'' prop" and "''B'' prop" are evident), then we form the compound proposition ''A and B'', written symbolically as "<math>A \wedge B</math>". We can write this in the form of an inference rule: <div style="margin-left: 2em;"> <math>\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{A \wedge B\hbox{ prop}}\ \wedge_F</math> </div> This inference rule is ''schematic'': ''A'' and ''B'' can be instantiated with any expression. The general form of an inference rule is: <div style="margin-left: 2em;"> <math>\frac{J_1 \qquad J_2 \qquad \cdots \qquad J_n}{J}\ \hbox{name}</math> </div> where each <math>J_i</math> is a judgment and the inference rule is named "name". The judgments above the line are known as ''premises'', and those below the line are ''conclusions''. Other common logical propositions are disjunction (<math>A \vee B</math>), negation (<math>\neg A</math>), implication (<math>A \supset B</math>), and the logical constants truth (<math>\top</math>) and falsehood (<math>\bot</math>). Their formation rules are below. <div style="margin-left: 2em;"> <math> \frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{A \vee B\hbox{ prop}}\ \vee_F \qquad \frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{A \supset B\hbox{ prop}}\ \supset_F \qquad \frac{\hbox{ }}{\top\hbox{ prop}}\ \top_F \qquad \frac{\hbox{ }}{\bot\hbox{ prop}}\ \bot_F </math> </div> <div style="margin-left: 2em;"> <math> \qquad \frac{A\hbox{ prop}}{\neg A\hbox{ prop}}\ \neg_F </math> </div> ==Introduction and elimination== Now we discuss the "''A'' true" judgment. Inference rules that introduce a logical connective in the conclusion are known as ''introduction rules''. To introduce conjunctions, ''i.e.'', to conclude "''A and B'' true" for propositions ''A'' and ''B'', one requires evidence for "''A'' true" and "''B'' true". As an inference rule: <div style="margin-left: 2em"> <math> \frac{A\hbox{ true} \qquad B\hbox{ true}}{A \wedge B\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I </math> </div> It must be understood that in such rules the objects are propositions. That is, the above rule is really an abbreviation for: <div style="margin-left: 2em"> <math> \frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop} \qquad A\hbox{ true} \qquad B\hbox{ true}}{A \wedge B\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I </math> </div> This can also be written: <div style="margin-left: 2em"> <math> \frac{A \wedge B\hbox{ prop} \qquad A\hbox{ true} \qquad B\hbox{ true}}{A \wedge B\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I </math> </div> In this form, the first premise can be satisfied by the <math>\wedge_F</math> formation rule, giving the first two premises of the previous form. In this article we shall elide the "prop" judgments where they are understood. In the nullary case, one can derive truth from no premises. <div style="margin-left: 2em"> <math> \frac{\ }{\top\hbox{ true}}\ \top_I
