by [[philosophical analysis|analysis]] should be possible to define by a holistic approach * [[Global optimization|Goal seeking]] - systemic interaction must result in some goal or final state * [[Input/output|Inputs]] and [[Outputs]] - in a [[closed system]] inputs are determined once and constant; in an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] additional inputs are admitted from the environment * Transformation of inputs into outputs - this is the process by which the goals are obtained * [[Entropy]] - the amount of disorder or randomness present in any system * [[Regulator (automatic control)|Regulation]] - a method of [[feedback]] is necessary for the system to operate predictably * [[Hierarchy]] - complex wholes are made up of smaller subsystems * [[Differentiation (sociology)|Differentiation]] - specialized units perform specialized functions * [[Equifinality]] - alternative ways of attaining the same objectives (convergence) * [[Multifinality]] - attaining alternative objectives from the same inputs (divergence) Some examples: *Rather than trying to improve the braking system on a car by looking in great detail at the material composition of the brake pads (reductionist), the ''boundary'' of the braking system may be extended to include the interactions between the: :* brake disks or drums :* brake pedal sensors :* hydraulics :* driver reaction time :* tires :* road conditions :* weather conditions :* time of day *Using the tenet of "Multifinality", a supermarket could be considered to be: :* a "profit making system" from the perspective of management and owners :* a "distribution system" from the perspective of the suppliers :* an "employment system" from the perspective of employees :* a "materials supply system" from the perspective of customers :* an "entertainment system" from the perspective of loiterers :* a "social system" from the perspective of local residents :* a "dating system" from the perspective of single customers As a result of such thinking, new insights may be gained into how the supermarket works, why it has problems, how it can be improved or how changes made to one component of the system may impact the other components. ==Applications== Science systems thinking is increasingly being used to tackle a wide variety of subjects in fields such as [[computing]], [[engineering]], [[epidemiology]], [[information science]], [[health]], [[manufacture]], [[management]], and the [[natural environment|environment]].
