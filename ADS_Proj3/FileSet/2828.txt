''matrix grammar'' is an ordered quadruple :<math>G = (V_N, V_T, X_0, M).</math> where * <math>V_N</math> is a finite set of non-terminals * <math>V_T</math> is a finite set of terminals * <math>X_0</math> is a special element of <math>V_N</math>, viz. the starting symbol * <math>M</math> is a finite set of non-empty sequences whose elements are ordered pairs :<math>(P, Q), \quad P \in W(V) V_N W(V), \quad Q \in W(V), \quad V = V_N \cup V_T.</math> The pairs are called productions, written as <math>P \to Q</math>. The sequences are called matrices and can be written as :<math>m = [P_1 \to Q_1, \ldots, P_r \to Q_r].</math> Let <math>F</math> be the set of all productions appearing in the matrices <math>m</math> of a matrix grammar <math>G</math>. Then the matrix grammar <math>G</math> is of type-<math>i, i = 0, 1, 2, 3</math>, ''length-increasing'', ''linear'', ''<math>\lambda</math>-free'', ''context-free'' or ''context-sensitive'' if and only if the grammar <math>G_1 = (V_N, V_T, X_0, F)</math> has the following property. For a matrix grammar <math>G</math>, a binary relation <math>\Rightarrow_G</math> is defined; also represented as <math>\Rightarrow</math>. For any <math>P, Q \in W(V)</math>, <math>P \Rightarrow Q</math> holds if and only if there exists an integer <math>r \ge 1</math> such that the words :<math>\alpha_1,, \ldots, \alpha_{r + 1}, \quad P_1, \ldots, P_r, \quad R_1, \ldots, R_r, \quad, R^1, \ldots, R^r</math> over V exist and * <math>\alpha_i = P</math> and <math>\alpha_{r + 1} = Q</math> * <math>m</math> is one of the matrices of <math>G</math> * <math>\alpha_i = R_i P_i R^i</math> and <math>\alpha_{i + 1} = R_i Q_i R^i.</math> If the above conditions are satisfied, it is also said that <math>P \Rightarrow Q</math> holds with <math>(m, R_1)</math> as the ''specifications''. Let <math>\Rightarrow^{*}</math> be the reflexive transitive closure of the relation <math>\Rightarrow</math>. Then, the language generated by the matrix grammar <math>G</math> is given by :<math>L(G) = \{P \in W(V_T) | X_0 \Rightarrow^{*} P\}.</math> == Example == Consider the matrix grammar <math>G = (\{S, X, Y\}, \{a, b, c\}, S, M)</math> where <math>M</math> is a collection containing the following matrices: <math>[S \rightarrow XY], \quad [X \rightarrow aXb, Y \rightarrow cY], \quad [X \rightarrow ab, Y \rightarrow c]</math> These matrices, which contain only ''context-free'' rules generate the ''context-sensitive'' language <math>L = \{a^nb^nc^n|n \ge 1\}.</math> This example can be found on pages 8 and 9 of {{ref|Abraham1965}}. == References == * {{note|Abraham1965}} Ábrahám, S.

It was released in 1998. ==History== [[Image:PoweredByMatrox.jpg|left|65px]] Matrox had been known for years as a significant player in the high-end 2D graphics accelerator market. Cards they produced were excellent [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] accelerators, and some of the later cards such as Millennium and Mystique excelled at [[MS-DOS]] as well. Matrox stepped forward in 1994 with their ''Impression Plus'' to innovate with one of the first [[3D accelerator]] boards, but that card only could accelerate a very limited feature set (no [[texture mapping]]), and was primarily targeted at [[computer aided design|CAD]] applications. Matrox, seeing the slow but steady growth in interest in 3D graphics on PCs with NVIDIA, Rendition, and ATI's new cards, began experimenting with 3D acceleration more aggressively and produced the Mystique. Mystique was their most [[feature-rich]] 3D accelerator in 1997, but still lacked key features including [[bilinear filtering]]. Then, in early 1998, Matrox teamed up with [[PowerVR]] to produce an add-in 3D board called ''Matrox m3D'' using the PowerVR PCX2 chipset. This board was one of the very few times that Matrox would outsource for their graphics processor, and was certainly a stop-gap measure to hold out until the G200 project was ready to go. ==Overview== With the G200, Matrox aimed to combine its past products' competent [[2D graphics|2D]] and [[video acceleration]] with a full-featured 3D accelerator. The G200 chip was used on several boards, most notably the ''Millennium G200'' and ''Mystique G200''. Millennium G200 received the new [[SGRAM]] memory and a faster [[RAMDAC]], while Mystique G200 was cheaper and equipped with slower [[SDRAM]] memory but gained a TV-out port. Most G200 boards shipped standard with 8 MB RAM and were expandable to 16 MB with an add-on module. The cards also had ports for special add-on boards, such as the ''Rainbow Runner'', which could add various functionality. G200 was Matrox's first fully [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]]-compliant graphics processor. While the earlier ''Millennium II'' had been adapted to AGP, it did not support the full AGP feature set. G200 takes advantage of DIME ([[Direct Memory Execute]]) to speed texture transfers to and from main system RAM. This allows G200 to use system RAM as texture storage if the card's local RAM is of insufficient size for the task at hand. G200 was one of the first cards to support this feature{{Fact|date=December 2008}}. The chip is a 128-bit core containing dual 64-bit buses in what Matrox calls a "DualBus" organization. Each bus is [[unidirectional]] and is designed to speed data transfer to and from the functional units within the chip. By doubling the internal data path with two separate buses instead of just a wider single bus, Matrox reduced latencies in data transfer by improving overall bus efficiency. <ref>[http://anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=294&p=3 AnandTech: Matrox Millennium G200] - Date: August 10th, 1998 / Topic: Video Card / Manufacturer: Matrox / Author: Anand Lal Shimpi</ref> The memory interface was 64-bit. G200 supported full [[32-bit color]] depth rendering which substantially pushed the image quality upwards by eliminating dithering artifacts caused by the then-more-typical [[16-bit color]] depth. Matrox called their technology ''Vibrant Color Quality'' (VCQ). The chip also supported features such as [[trilinear filtering|trilinear mip-map filtering]] and [[anti-aliasing]] (though this was rarely used). The G200 could render 3D at all resolutions supported in 2D. Architecturally, the 3D pipeline was laid out as a single pixel pipeline with a single texture management unit. The core contained a RISC processor called the "WARP core", that implemented
