there is a good understanding of the role of inventory and its perameters, and an effective business process to support that, the system cannot bring the necessary benefits to the organisation in isolation. Typical Inventory Management techniques include Pareto Curve ABC Classification<ref>http://www.inventorymatters.co.uk.noisegate2.webhoster.co.uk//userFiles/extending_the_pareto_principle.pdf</ref> and Economic Order Quantity Management. A more sophisticated method takes these two techniques further, combining certain aspects of each to create The K Curve Methodology.<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.6601</ref> A case study of k-curve<ref>http://www.inventorymatters.co.uk.noisegate2.webhoster.co.uk//userFiles/mk_kcurve_case_study.pdf</ref> benefits to one company shows a successful implementation. Unnecessary inventory adds enormously to the working capital tied up in the business, as well as the complexity of the supply chain. Reduction and elimination of these inventory 'wait' states is a key concept in Lean.<ref>http://www.phitch.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mWpeMu89r5Q=&tabid=64</ref> Too big an inventory reduction too quickly can cause a business to be anorexic. There are well-proven processes and techniques to assist in inventory planning and strategy, both at the business overview and part number level. Many of the big MRP/and ERP systems do not offer the necessary inventory planning tools within their integrated planning applications. ==Principle of inventory proportionality== ===Purpose=== Inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management. The primary optimal outcome is to have the same number of days' (or hours', etc.) worth of inventory on hand across all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous. In such a case, there is no "excess inventory," that is, inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out. Excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain it could have been utilized better elsewhere, i.e. to the product that just ran out. The secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization. By integrating accurate [[demand forecasting]] with inventory management, replenishment inventories can be scheduled to arrive just in time to replenish the product destined to run out first, while at the same time balancing out the inventory supply of all products to make their inventories more proportional, and thereby closer to achieving the primary goal. Accurate demand forecasting also allows the desired inventory proportions to be dynamic by determining expected sales out into the future; this allows for inventory to be in proportion to expected short-term sales or consumption rather than to past averages, a much more accurate and optimal outcome. Integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the "can fit" point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis. ===Applications=== The technique of inventory proportionality is most appropriate for inventories that remain unseen by the consumer. As opposed to "keep full" systems where a retail consumer would like to see full shelves of the product they are buying so as not to think they are buying something old, unwanted or stale; and differentiated from the "trigger point" systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level; inventory proportionality is used effectively by just-in-time manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view. One early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the United States is for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists do not know whether they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by [[Petrolsoft Corporation]] in 1990 for [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.<ref name=aspentech>{{cite|url=http://www.aspentech.com/solutions/industry_solutions/refining_marketing/aspenone_supply_distribution.cfm|title=aspenONE Supply & Distribution for Refining & Marketing}}</ref> ===Roots=== The use of inventory proportionality in the United States is thought to have been inspired by Japanese [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] parts inventory management made famous by [[Toyota]] Motors in the 1980s.[http://www.bsu.edu/web/scfrazier2/jit/mainpage.htm] ==High-level inventory management== It seems that around 1880<ref>Relevance Lost, Johnson and Kaplan, Harvard Business School Press, 1987, p126</ref> there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to vertically integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information on the effect of product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for [[financial accounting]] of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over [[management accounting]] remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory. Hence, high-level financial inventory has these two basic formulas, which relate to the accounting period: #Cost of [[Beginning Inventory]] at the start of the period + inventory [[purchase]]s within the period + cost of [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] within the period = cost of goods available # Cost of goods available âˆ’ cost of [[ending inventory]] at the end of the period = [[cost of goods sold]] The benefit of these formulae is that the first absorbs all overheads of production and raw material costs into a value of inventory for reporting. The second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from
