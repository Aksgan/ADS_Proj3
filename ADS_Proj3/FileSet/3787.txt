is any change in form. In [[SVK]], a Revision is the state at a point in time of the entire tree in the repository. ; Ring: {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} See '''tag'''. ; Share: The act of making one file or folder available in multiple branches at the same time. When a shared file is changed in one branch, it is changed in other branches. ; Stream : A container for branched files that has a known relationship to other such containers. Streams form a hierarchy; each stream can inherit various properties (like versions, namespace, workflow rules, subscribers, etc.) from its parent stream. ; [[Revision tag|Tag]] : A '''tag''' or '''label''' refers to an important snapshot in time, consistent across many files. These files at that point may all be tagged with a user-friendly, meaningful name or revision number. See [[#Baselines, labels and tags|baselines, labels and tags]]. ; [[Trunk (software)|Trunk]]: The unique line of development that is not a branch (sometimes also called Baseline or Mainline) ; Update : An '''update''' (or '''sync''') merges changes made in the repository (by other people, for example) into the local '''working copy'''.<ref name="svnbook-merge"/> ; Working copy: The '''working copy''' is the local copy of files from a repository, at a specific time or revision. All work done to the files in a repository is initially done on a working copy, hence the name. Conceptually, it is a ''[[Sandbox (software development)|sandbox]]''. ==See also== * [[Comparison of revision control software]] * [[Distributed revision control]] * [[Software configuration management]] (SCM) * [[Software versioning]] * [[Versioning file system]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html Eric Sink's Source Control HOWTO] A primer on the basics of version control * [http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/ Visual Guide to Version Control] * [http://better-scm.berlios.de/comparison/ Better SCM Initiative: Comparison] A useful summary of different systems and their features. {{Revision control software}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Revision Control}} [[Category:Version control]] [[Category:Revision control systems]] [[Category:Technical communication]] [[Category:Software development process]] [[af:Weergawebeheerstelsel]] [[ar:نظام تحكم بالمراجعات]] [[bg:Система за контрол на версиите]] [[cs:Verzování]] [[de:Versionsverwaltung]] [[et:Versioonihaldus]] [[es:Control de versiones]] [[fa:سورس کنترل]] [[fr:Gestion de versions]] [[ko:버전 관리]] [[hy:Վերահսկման կառավարում]] [[id:Pengontrol versi]] [[it:Controllo versione]] [[he:ניהול גרסאות]] [[lv:Versiju pārvaldības sistēma]] [[lt:Versijų kontrolės sistema]] [[hu:Verziókezelés]] [[nl:Versiebeheersysteem]] [[ja:バージョン管理システム]] [[no:Versjonskontrollsystem]] [[pl:System kontroli wersji]] [[pt:Sistema de controle de versão]] [[ro:Controlul versiunilor]] [[ru:Система управления версиями]] [[fi:Versiohallinta]] [[sv:Versionshantering]] [[ta:திருத்தக் கட்டுப்பாடு]] [[th:การควบคุมการปรับปรุงแก้ไข]] [[tr:Sürüm Kontrol Sistemi]] [[uk:Система керування версіями]] [[vi:Hệ thống quản lý phiên bản]] [[zh:版本控制]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31997</id> <title>Revit</title> <text>{{Primary sources|date=September 2010}} {{Infobox software | name = Revit | logo = | screenshot =[[Image:Revit 8 screen shot.png|200px|First screen seen in Revit 2010 when starting new project.]] | caption = First screen seen in Revit 2010 when starting new project. | developer = [[Autodesk]] | latest_release_version = 2011 | latest_release_date = April 2010 | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] | genre = [[CAD]] [[Building Information Modeling]] | license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] | website = [http://www.autodesk.com/revit Autodesk Revit site] }} '''Revit''' is a [[Building Information Modeling]] software for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed by [[Autodesk]]. It allows the user to design with both parametric [[3D modeling]] and 2D drafting elements. Building Information Modeling is a [[Computer Aided Design]] (CAD) paradigm that employs intelligent 3D objects to represent real physical building components such as walls and doors. In addition, Revit's database for a project can contain information about a project at various stages in the building's lifecycle, from concept to construction to decommissioning. This is sometimes called 4D CAD where time is the fourth dimension. Autodesk purchased the Massachusetts-based Revit Technology Corporation for US$133 million in 2002.<ref>[http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=9262388 Autodesk to Acquire Revit Technology Corporation.]</ref> The latest released version is Revit Architecture/Structure/MEP 2011 (April, 2010) <ref>[http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=9262388 Autodesk Revit Architecture 2011]</ref> and the corresponding AutoCAD Revit Suite 2011 products. (AutoCAD Revit Suite combines a seat of AutoCAD with a seat of Revit on a given workstation for a slightly higher price than Revit alone.) On September 29, 2008, Autodesk released 64-bit versions of Revit 2009 products for subscription customers. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Revit 2010 and 2011 products are available without subscription in the standard installation. Revit is localized into multiple languages, including German, French, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Hungarian and Russian. ==Product lineup== Since purchasing Revit, Autodesk has developed three versions of Revit for the varying building design disciplines: * [http://autodesk.com/revitarchitecture Revit Architecture], for architects and building designers (formerly ''Revit Building''). The [http://autodesk.com/revitarchitecturesuite AutoCAD Revit Architecture Suite] includes Revit Architecture, AutoCAD, and AutoCAD Architecture. An [http://www.autodesk.com/architecturevisualizationsuite AutoCAD Revit Architecture Visualization Suite] also adds 3ds Max Design and Navisworks Review, and is available only in the following countries; Singapore, the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. * [http://autodesk.com/revitstructure Revit Structure], for structural engineers. The [http://autodesk.com/revitstructuresuite Revit Structure Suite] includes Revit Structure, AutoCAD, and AutoCAD Structural Detailing. * [http://autodesk.com/revitmep Revit MEP], for mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineers (formerly ''Revit Systems''). The [http://autodesk.com/revitmepsuite Revit MEP Suite] includes Revit MEP, AutoCAD, and AutoCAD MEP. ==How it works== Revit uses .RVT files for storing BIM models. Typically, a building is made using 3D objects to create walls, floors, roofs, structure, windows, doors and other objects as needed. These [[parametric object]]s{{mdash}} 3D building objects (such as windows or doors) or 2D drafting objects (such as surface patterns){{mdash}} are called "families" and are saved in .RFA files, and imported into the RVT database as needed. A Revit model is a single [[database]] file represented in the various ways which are useful for design work. Such representations can be plans, sections, elevations, legends, and schedules. Because changes to each representation of the database model are made to one central model, changes made in one representation of the model (for example a plan) are propagated to other representations of the model (for example elevations). Thus, Revit drawings and schedules are always fully coordinated in terms of the building objects shown in drawings. When a project database is shared, a central file is created which stores the master copy of the project database on a file server on the office's [[LAN]]. Each user works on a copy of the central file (known as the local file), stored on the user's workstation.
