It was sung by [[Roger Waters]], with harmonies by [[David Gilmour]]. After Waters left, Gilmour sang the lead when performing live. The song is often mistakenly labelled "Dark Side of the Moon" alongside "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" because the two run together and are commonly played together on the radio, giving the impression that they are one song. The incorrect title is derived from a recurring lyric in "Brain Damage" and the title of the album. ==Composition== <!-- {{SectOR|date=May 2008}} --> <!-- Removing this as well, as this section is where the references are referenced; it's clearly not original research! Oh, and there was NO explanation for it on the Talk page! --> The song serves as a climax to the album and features a loud, repetitive melody which builds and then ends with a very quiet outro. When the main instrumentation ends at approximately 1:30, the sound of a heartbeat from the first track, "[[Speak to Me]]", appears, which appears again in 9/8, and gradually fades to silence. The song consists of a repeating four chord pattern: D Major, D over C in the bass (a [[compound chord]] usually notated as "D/C".), B-flat [[Major seventh chord|Major Seventh]] ("B♭maj7" -- this chord can be heard as a D ''minor'' over a B♭ bass, or "Dm/B♭", though that is not a proper chord name), and A7 (with a [[suspended fourth]] resolving to the [[major third]] -- notated as A7sus4 to A7). However, the arrangement adds variety. Guitarist [[David Gilmour]] recorded two tracks of rhythm guitar, playing [[arpeggio]]s, one in open position, and one much higher, around the tenth [[fret]]. The lower-pitched guitar part includes the open G and E strings during the B♭maj7, resulting in an [[added sixth]] and a [[dissonance (music)|dissonant]] [[augmented fourth]]. However, these notes become [[consonance (music)|consonant]] as they sustain through to the next chord, A7. The quartet of female background singers vary their parts, rising in volume, and echoing some of Waters' lyrics, as the piece builds in intensity. On the last repetition of the chord progression, the B♭maj7 leads directly to a climax on D major, resulting in a "brightening" effect (known as the [[Picardy third]]), as the aforementioned implication of D minor in the B♭maj7 chord shifts to the major.<ref>''Pink Floyd: The Dark Side of the Moon'' 1973 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, ISBN 0 7119 1028 6 (USA ISBN 0 8256 1078 8) </ref><ref>''Which One's Pink?

Roger Waters explained the meaning of these words as well as the ''entire song'' by asserting,<br /> {{cquote|"I don't see it (the last words quoted above) as a riddle. The album uses the sun and the moon as symbols; the light and the dark; the good and the bad; the life force as opposed to the death force. I think it's a very simple statement saying that all the good things life can offer are there for us to grasp, but that the influence of some dark force in our natures prevents us from seizing them. The song addresses the listener and says that if you, the listener are affected by that force, and if that force is a worry to you, well I feel exactly the same too. The line 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon' is me speaking to the listener, saying, 'I know you have these bad feelings and impulses because ''I do too'' and one of the ways I can make direct contact with you is to share with you the fact that I feel bad sometimes."<ref>Dallas, Karl, ''Pink Floyd: Bricks in the Wall'', page 107, Shapolsky Publishers/Baton Press, ISBN 0-933503-88-1, 1987.</ref>}} At the end of "Eclipse", after or during the spoken words of 'There is no dark side...', a small chamber string orchestra can be heard playing a light tune which sounds like it's heard from a small radio in another room. To be able to hear this, one must listen especially carefully with headphones and the volume at maximum level. This tune is believed to be an orchestral version of [[The Beatles]]' song "[[Ticket to Ride]]". Fans have tried to find a meaning behind this, but it was likely just an artifact of the recording process, such as an improperly erased tape. The recording has been identified by some as having come from [[George Martin]]'s orchestral adaptation of the Beatles album ''[[Help! (George Martin album)|Help!]]''. Coincidentally, [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]] were recording in the same studio. McCartney was one of the people interviewed by Roger Waters as part of the latter's efforts to develop dialogue to accompany certain songs on the album. The McCartney interview was not used, but [[Abbey Road Studios]] doorman Gerry O'Driscoll's was. His full answer to the question "What
