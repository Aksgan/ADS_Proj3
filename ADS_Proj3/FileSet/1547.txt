Samuelson]] published in 1947 (Enlarged ed., 1983). It sought to demonstrate a common mathematical structure underlying multiple branches of economics from two basic principles: [[mathematical programming|optimizing]] behavior of [[agent (economics)|agents]] and stability of [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] as to economic systems (such as markets or economies). Among other contributions, it advanced the theory of [[index numbers]] and generalized [[welfare economics]]. It is especially known for definitively stating and formalizing [[qualitative economics|qualitative]] and quantitative versions of the "[[comparative statics]]" method for calculating how a change in any [[parameter]] (say, a change in tax rates) affects an economic system. One of its key insights about comparative statics, called the [[Comparative statics#Stability|correspondence principle]], states that [[General equilibrium#Stability|stability]] of equilibrium implies testable predictions about how the equilibrium changes when parameters are changed. ==Introduction== The front page quotes the motto of [[J. Willard Gibbs]]: "Mathematics is a language." The book begins with this exacting statement: :''The existence of analogies between central features of various theories implies the existence of a general theory which underlies the particular theories and unifies them with respect to those central features.'' This fundamental principle of generalization by abstraction was enunciated by the eminent American mathematician [[E. H. Moore]] more than thirty years ago. It is the purpose of the pages that follow to work out its implications for theoretical and applied economics. Its other stated purpose (p. 3) is to show how ''[[Falsifiability|operationally meaningful]] theorems'' can be described with a small number of ''analogous methods''. Thus, "a general theory of economic theories" (1983, p. xxvi). ==Topical outline== The body of the book is 353 pages. Topics and applications covered (all in terms of theory) include the following. : Part I * introduction * [[General equilibrium|equilibrium systems]] (such as [[Supply and demand|for a market]] or economy) * maximizing behavior (such as to [[profit maximization|profits]] by a firm and [[Consumer theory|utility]] by a consumer) in the calculus : sales-tax increase on equilibrium for a firm * [[comparative statics]] (changes in [[Supply and demand|prices and quantities]] and other equilibrium variables when underlying conditions change) * [[Isoquant|cost and production]] * [[consumer theory|consumer's behavior]] * transformations, [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]], [[Composite good|composite commodities]], [[Index (economics)|index numbers]], and rationing * [[cardinal utility]], constancy of the marginal utility of income, and [[consumer's surplus]] * [[welfare economics]] : Part II * [[General equilibrium|stability of equilibrium systems]], dynamics (disturbances in equilibrium), and comparative statics : the [[IS/LM model|Keynesian system]] * linear and nonlinear systems : Malthusian and optimum population * dynamics : the business cycle : [[endogenous]] models : mixed [[exogenous]]-[[endogenous]] theories : mixed systems of a linear-[[stochastic]] type * conclusions (on [[General equilibrium|neoclassical theory]] from [[Walras]] to hints of the [[Exogenous growth model|future]] in ''comparative dynamics'', the comparative-statics counterpart of dynamic systems) == Methods and analysis ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Le Chatelier's principle]] --> Samuelson's ''Foundations'' demonstrates that economic analysis benefits from the parsimonious and fruitful language of mathematics. In its original version as a dissertation submitted to the David A. Wells Prize Committee of Harvard University in 1941, it was subtitled "The Observational Significance of Economic Theory" (p. ix). One unifying theme, on the striking formal similarities of analysis in seemingly diverse fields, occurred only in the course of writing on them—from consumer's behavior and production economics of the firm to international trade, business cycles, and income analysis. It dawned on the author that he was prodigal "in proving essentially the same theorems" over and over. His failure of initial intuition, so he suggests, might be less surprising in light of the few economic writings then extant concerned with formulating ''meaningful theorems'' -- hypotheses ''about'' empirical data—that could [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|conceivably be refuted]] ''by'' empirical data (pp. 3–5). Samuelson (pp. 5, 21-24) finds three sources of meaningful theorems sufficient to illuminate his purposes: * ''maximizing behavior'' of economic units (as to ''utility'' for a consumer and ''profit'' for a firm) * economic ''systems'' (including ''market''s and ''economies'') in ''stable'' equilibrium * [[Qualitative economics|qualitative properties]] between two or more variables, such as an alleged technological relation or psychological law (indexed by the sign of the relevant functional relationship). Part I conjectures that meaningful theorems for economic units and for their respective aggregates are almost all derivable from general conditions of equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions can in turn be stated as ''maximization conditions''. So, meaningful theorems reduce to [[Extremum|maximization conditions]]. The calculus of the relations is at a high level of abstraction but with the advantage of numerous applications. Finally, Part I illustrates that there ''are'' meaningful theorems in economics, which apply to diverse fields. Part II concentrates on aggregation of economic units into equilibrium of the system. But the symmetry conditions required for direct maximization of the ''system'', whether a market or even the simplest model of the business cycle, are lacking, in contrast
