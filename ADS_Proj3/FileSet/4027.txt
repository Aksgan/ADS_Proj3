jointly operated by Australians and Americans. As opposed to many military-only bases, Pine Gap has a significant number of CIA as well as military [[Naval Security Group|NAVSECGRU]] staff. It has 18 antennas, and has been considered first a receiving station for SIGINT satellites, but the size of some of its antennas are more associated with a requirement to intercept communications from commercial communications satellites. The station in Pine Gap was established in 1966. It is run by the Australian [[Defence Signals Directorate]], and roughly half of the 900 station personnel are Americans from the CIA and "Until 1980 no Australians were allowed to work in the signals analysis department; since then, they have been granted free access to all parts of the station, with the exception of the Americans’ own cryptography room."{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The European Parliament report stated that the Shoal Bay facility is "run solely by the Australian Intelligence Service. Of the satellite antennas visible on photographs, the five larger ones have a maximum diameter of 8 m, and the sixth antenna visible is smaller still. According to information provided by Richelson, the antennas are trained on the Indonesian PALAPA satellites. It is not clear whether the station is part of the global system for the interception of civilian communications."<ref name = EPE /> ===Cuba: Ground Platforms=== While Cuba had traditionally been a Soviet client, it both has been developing indigenous capabilities, including equipment design and manufacture, as well as having Chinese-operated stations on its soil. Within the Cuban intelligence ministry, a Counter-Electronic Warfare Department was established in 1997, at the same level as the Technical Department and the Foreign Intelligence) Department. In 1992, a tactically oriented Counter-Electronic Warfare Department was created. The national intelligence organization also runs electronic warfare and SIGINT for the Air Force and Navy. Russia and China, at various times, have operated or are operating intercept stations in Cuba. The largest and best-known, [[Lourdes SIGINT Station]], was shut down by Russia in 2001, along with the Russian station at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam.<ref name=CNN-SIGINT>{{citation | last = Cable News Network | title = Russia to close Cuban spy station | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/10/17/putin.cuba/index.html | accessdate = 2007-10-13 | work=CNN | date=2001-10-18}}</ref> Of the additional bases are in Cuba, two of which are operated by China:<ref name=CubaIW>{{citation | url = http://www.cubainfolinks.org/webpage/Articles/bejucal.htm | title = Information Warfare (IW): Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Warfare (EW) and Cyber-Warfare.

The first seems concerned with intercepting US telephone communications and data traffic, while the second appears aimed at US military satellites One is a large complex at Bejucal, just south of Havana, which has ten SATCOM antennas, and which is primarily concerned with intercepting telephone communications in the US.<ref name=CubaIW /> A 'cyber-warfare' unit at the station focuses on computer data traffic. The second is located northeast of Santiago de Cuba at the eastern-most part of the country and is 'dedicated mainly to intercepting U.S. military satellite communications'. ===France: Ground Platforms=== ====France: Strategic Ground Platforms==== The technical department of the French espionage service, DGSE, operates a major communications satellite collection site at Domme, in the Dordogne valley to the east of Bordeaux, in south-western France. This site, which includes at least 11 collection antennas, seven of them directed at Atlantic satellites, is clearly as extensive and capable as the largest sites in the UKUSA network.<ref name=CampbellIC2000>{{citation | first = Duncan | last = Campbell | url = http://duncan.gn.apc.org/stoa_cover.htm | title = Interception Capabilities 2000: Report to the European Parliament }}</ref> Reports by journalists, cited in the European Parliament report, confirm the Domme installation, and also a facility at Alluetts-le-Roi near Paris. There were also reports of stations in Kourou in French Guyana and in Mayotte. ====France: Tactical Ground Platforms==== At the tactical force protection levels, Thales was awarded a contract to build SAEC (Station d'Appui Electronique de Contact) force protection stations, by the French defence procurement agency (DGA)<ref name = Loring2007>{{citation | author = Thales | title = Tactical SIGINT stations for force protection |date=27 November 2006 | url = http://www.thalesonline.com/landjoint/Activities/Details.html?link=09101D63-655B-112A-6D31-08497B253F1C:central%20activities%20all&locale=EN-gb&Title=SAEC&dis=1 | accessdate = 2007-10-18 }}</ref>. The contract was awarded in 2004 and initial operational capability is expected by 2007. The SAEC is an armored vehicle carrying ELINT and the Thales XPLORER COMINT to complement EW platforms. It will have wideband acquisition, direction-finding and analysis sensors, for real-time monitoring and recording for subsequent analysis. It can operate standalone, or network using VHF (PR4G) and HF (TRC3700) communication systems for networking with other SAEC and the SGEA higher level EW system. SGEA will do intelligence fusion, including from UAV-carried sensor, and coordinate with electronic attack. ===Germany: Ground Platforms=== ====Germany: Strategic Ground Platforms==== Germany operates a strategic ground station at the Kommando Strategische Aufklärung (Strategic Reconnaissance Command) of the [[Bundeswehr]], in Gelsdorf, which is responsible for controlling Germany's [[SAR Lupe]] system and analysing the retrieved data. A large data archive of images will be kept in a former Cold War bunker. The [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]], Germany's foreign intelligence service, also operates several SIGINT platforms. ====Germany: Tactical Ground Platforms==== Germany operates several tactical ground platforms for SIGINT gathering. The ''Kommando Strategische Aufklärung'' (Strategic Reconnaissance Command) of the Bundeswehr operates three mobile and three stationary SIGNIT battalions. ===Russia: Ground Platforms=== ====Russia: Strategic Ground Platforms==== Russia closed its major ground collection stations at Lourdes in Cuba and Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. Stations remain at the Ras Karma Military Airbase, near QaDub on [[Socotra Island]] in Yemen, across the Red Sea to Somalia, and at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden in the Indian Ocean. An inactive station at Ramona in North Korea may reopen.<ref name=ScherbakovFAPSI /> ====Russia: Tactical Ground Platforms==== Arbalet-M is mentioned in Russian literature as a portable direction-finding and electronic attack system <ref name=ThomasArbalet>{{citation | url = http://leav-www.army.mil/fmso/documents/iwchechen.htm | title = Information Warfare in the Second (1999-Present) Chechen War: Motivator for
