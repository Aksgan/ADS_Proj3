(When both sides have passed, skilled players will nearly always agree which stones are dead and which are alive.) '''Area scoring (including Chinese):''' A player's score is the number of stones they have on the board, plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that player's stones. '''Territory scoring (including Japanese and Korean):''' In the course of the game, each player retains the stones they capture, termed ''prisoners''. Any dead stones removed at the end of the game become prisoners. The score is the number of empty points enclosed by a player's stones, plus the number of prisoners captured by that player.<ref group="nb">Exceptionally, in Japanese and Korean rules, empty points, even those surrounded by stones of a single colour, may count as neutral territory if some of them are alive by ''seki''. See the section on "Life and Death" for seki.</ref> If there is disagreement about which stones are dead, then under area scoring rules, the players simply resume play to resolve the matter. The score is computed using the position after the next time the players pass consecutively. Under territory scoring, the rules are considerably more complex; however, in practice, players will generally play on, and, once the status of each stone has been determined, return to the position at the time the first two consecutive passes occurred and remove the dead stones. For further information, see [[Rules of Go]]. Given that the number of stones a player has on the board is related to the number of prisoners the opponent has taken, the resulting ''net'' score (the difference between Black and White's respective scores) under both rulesets is often identical and rarely differs by more than a point.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/rules/AGA.commentary.html | title = Demonstration of the Relationship of Area and Territory Scoring | first = Fred | last = Hansen | publisher = American Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref> ===Life and death=== {{see also|Life and death}} While not actually mentioned in the rules of Go (at least in simpler rule sets, such as those of New Zealand and the US), the concept of a ''living'' group of stones is necessary for a practical understanding of the game.<ref name=EyesSeki>Matthews 2002</ref> <div class="thumb tleft"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:184px; font-size: 100%;"> {{Goban 9x9|= |ulc| b| b| w| u| w| b| uc| b|= | b| c| b| w| | w| b| b| rc|= | b| b| w| w| | w| w| b| b|= | w| w| w| | | | w| b| rc|= | l| | | | | | w| b| b|= | w| w| | | | | w| w| w|= | b| w| w| w| w| | w| b| b|= | l| b| b| b| w| | w| b| rc|= | b| b| dc| b| w| d| w| b| b|20}} <div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;"> Examples of eyes </div> </div> </div> When a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones elsewhere, the status of the group is either ''alive'', ''dead'' or ''unsettled''. A group of stones is said to be alive if it cannot be captured, even if the opponent is allowed to move first. Conversely, a group of stones is said to be dead if it cannot avoid capture, even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move. If the status of a group depends on whether the owner or his opponent moves first, the group is said to be unsettled. In such a situation, the player that moves first may either make it alive if he is the owner, or ''kill'' it if he is the group owner's opponent.<ref name=EyesSeki/> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:184px; font-size: 100%;"> {{Goban 9x9|= | ul| b| b| w| u| w| u| u| ur|= | b| | b| w| w| w| w| w| w|= | b| b| w| w| b| b| b| b| b|= | w| w| w| b| b| | b| | b|= | b| b| b| w| | b| b| b| b|= | lc| c| b| w| w| w| w| w| b|= | w| w| w| b| w| | w| b| b|= | b| b| b| b| w| w| w| b| r|= | dl| b| d| b| w| d| w| b| b|20}} <div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;"> Example of seki (mutual life) </div> </div> </div> For a group to be alive, it needs to be able to create at least two "[[Go terms#Eyes|eyes]]" if threatened. An eye is an empty point that is surrounded by friendly stones and where the opponent can never play due to the suicide rule. If two such eyes exist, the opponent can never capture a group of stones, because it will always have at least two liberties. One eye is not enough for life, because a point that would normally be suicide may be played upon if doing so fills the last liberty of opposing stones, thereby capturing those stones. In the "Examples of eyes" diagram, all the circled points are eyes. The two black groups in the upper corners are alive, as both have at least two eyes. The groups in the lower corners are dead, as both have only one eye. The group in the lower left may seem to have two eyes, but the surrounded empty point without a circle is not actually an eye. White can play there and take a black stone. Such a point is often called a ''false'' eye.<ref name=EyesSeki/> There is a rare exception to the requirement that a group must have two eyes to be alive, a situation called ''seki'' (or ''mutual life'').
