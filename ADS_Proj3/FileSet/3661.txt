range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name="DiVincenzo 1995" /> These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time. If the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction, which corrects errors due to decoherence, thereby allowing the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time. An often cited figure for required error rate in each gate is 10<sup>−4</sup>. This implies that each gate must be able to perform its task in one 10,000th of the decoherence time of the system. Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of bits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> qubits without error correction.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610117|title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible?|accessdate=2007-02-16|author=M. I. Dyakonov, Université Montpellier|date=2006-10-14}}</ref> With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10<sup>7</sup> qubits. Note that computation time is about <math>L^2</math> or about <math>10^7</math> steps and on 1 M[[Hertz|Hz]], about 10 [[second]]s.
