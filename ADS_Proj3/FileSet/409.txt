former. Being is objective not subjective or individual. *[[Being in itself#Being-in-itself for Sartre|Being-in-itself]] (''être-en-soi''): Non-conscious Being. The sort of phenomenon that is greater than the knowledge that we have of it. *[[Pour soi|Being-for-itself]] (''être-pour-soi''): The nihilation of Being-in-itself; consciousness conceived as a lack of Being, a desire for Being, a relation of Being. The For-itself brings Nothingness into the world and therefore can stand out from Being and form attitudes towards other beings by seeing what it is not. *Being-for-others (''être-pour-autrui''): Here a new dimension arises in which the self exists as an object for others. Each For-itself seeks to recover its own Being by making an object out of the other. *Consciousness: The transcending For-itself. Sartre states that "Consciousness is a being such that in its being, its being is in question insofar as this being implies a being other than itself." *[[Existence]]: Concrete, individual being-for-itself here and now. *[[Existence precedes essence]]. The subjective existence of reality precedes and defines its nature. Who you are (your essence) is defined by what you do (your existence). *[[Facticity]] (''facticité''): Broadly: facts about the world. More precisely, the For-itself's necessary connection with the In-itself, with the world and its own past. *Freedom: The very being of the For-itself which is "condemned to be free". It must forever choose for itself and therefore make itself. *Nothingness (''néant''): Although not having being, it is supported by being. It comes into the world by the For-itself. *Reflection (''reflet''): The form in which the For-itself founds its own nothingness through the dyad of "the-reflection-reflecting" *Reflection (''réflexion''):The consciousness attempting to become its own object. ==Connection to ''No Exit''== A man or a woman will always be in a world of other people, who can capture him within their [[gaze]], reducing him to his external materiality. They will take his measure, call him hero, coward, nonentity, fool, etc. And then, at last, they will tote up the balance sheet of his life after his death. Thus, for Sartre's Garcin, in ''[[No Exit]],'' "hell is other people." There is a second reference. When explaining the difference between existence and essence, Sartre uses a paper-knife (un coupe-papier). A paper-knife also appears as a crucial prop in ''No Exit''. == Sartre's solution == Against all this Sartre can offer only the ruthless probing and dissolution of one's illusions. In this he is entirely in line with [[Sigmund Freud]] whom he otherwise critiques in ''Being and Nothingness''. Indeed, in many respects Sartre is far more ruthless towards the self's illusions than Freud ever was. This is why the early Sartre, of the "existentialist" period (1943–50) was so often anathema to political parties, with their programs, plans, and [[dogma]]s. There could be no radical [[utopia]]n experiments for early Sartre. Nor could there be the platitudes of [[Liberalism|liberal]] or [[Conservatism|conservative]] world-views. Sartre carries this "hyperempiricism" into his later work, and the fellow-travelling Sartre of the 1950s and after seems almost to forget the Sartre of the 1940s, and it would not be until ''The Family Idiot'', his "existential [[psychoanalysis]]" of [[Gustave Flaubert]] that Sartre would attempt to bring together his existentialist and [[Marxist]] views. ==In popular culture== In the movie ''[[Roxanne]]'' (1987), actor Rick Rossovich (Chris) goes into a book store and asks for a copy of ''Being and Nothingness''. In the sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' Episode 5.24 "The Motion Picture", Woody is given ''Being and Nothingness'' as a gift from Diane; she claims it was given to her by her mother while she was in grade school. A copy of the book ''Being and Nothingness'' can be clearly seen in a car in one of the early scenes in the movie ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]''. In the movie ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004), ''Being and Nothingness'' is one of the books that 'pop' out from the bookcase showing the books that Klaus has read. The book makes an appearance in ''[[Love Potion No. 9]]'' starring [[Sandra Bullock]]. In the film ''Short Order'' or ''[[Life is a Buffet]]'' (2005), posters with the title ''Being and Nothingness'' are seen behind Fifi Koko as she confronts another chef. ==See also== *[[Being in itself#Being-in-itself for Sartre|Being-in-itself]] *[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]] *[[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde'''s 100 Books of the Century]] ==References== {{reflist}} ''Sartre, Jean-Paul, Pg. 101-103, Being and Nothingness A Phenomenological Essay On Ontology.
