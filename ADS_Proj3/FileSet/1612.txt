City and ACT-Europe in Paris, to provide continuing development and commercial support of GNAT. Both companies were integrated and renamed to [[AdaCore]] in 2004. GNAT was initially released separately from the main GCC sources. On October 2, 2001 the GNAT sources were contributed to the GCC [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] repository. The last version to be released separately was GNAT 3.15p, based on GCC 2.8.1, on October 2, 2002. Starting with GCC 3.4, on major platforms the official GCC release is able to pass 100% of the [[ACATS]] Ada tests included in the GCC testsuite. In GCC 4.0, more exotic platforms are also able to pass 100% of ACATS. == License == As of July 2010, the latest version of the compiler is licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. The "GNAT GPL Edition" of the runtime is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] while the "GNAT Pro Edition" is under the [[GNAT Modified General Public License]]. All versions leading up to and including 3.15p are licensed under the MGPL.

GPS uses [[compiler]]s from the [[GNU Compiler Collection]], taking its name from [[GNAT]], the GNU compiler for the [[Ada programming language]]. GPS is [[cross-platform]], running on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. GPS uses [[GTK+]] as the [[widget toolkit]] for its [[graphical user interface]]. Released under the [[GNAT Modified General Public License]], GPS is [[free software]]. == Features == GPS supports a variety of programming languages other than Ada, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[JavaScript]], [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. In addition, it supports a number of other file types for [[build system]]s such as [[Autoconf]] and [[Make (software)|Make]], along with documentation formats like [[Changelog]] and [[Texinfo]]. The most interesting new development function of GPS from version 4.0 are remote edit, remote debug and [[cross-compilation]] capabilities for platforms for which GPS/GCC are not natively available. The new version also includes new edit functions, among which is an intelligent [[autocomplete]] feature. GPS supports the following [[Revision control|Version control systems]]: [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[Rational ClearCase]], [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]], [[Git (software)|git]]. GPS can edit files encoded in all GNAT supported encoding schemas. In detail: [[ISO-8859-1]], [[ISO-8859-2]], [[ISO-8859-5]], [[ISO-8859-6]], [[ISO-8859-7]], [[KOI8-R]], [[Shift JIS]], [[GB2312]], [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]. GPS uses [[Python (programming language)|Python]] as a [[scripting language]]. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Comparison of integrated development environments]] ==References== {{Unreferenced|date=October 2007}} {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://libre.adacore.com/gps Official GPS Homepage] * [http://gnuada.sourceforge.net GNU Ada Project] on [[SourceForge.net]] * [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_rm/ GNAT Reference Manual] * [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/AdaCore's+GNAT+Pro+Development+Environment+to+Support+Boeing's...-a0148612924 AdaCore's GNAT Pro Development Environment to Support Boeing's Real-time Simulation Systems] * [http://www.electronicstalk.com/news/adf/adf104.html Environment accelerated Ada programming] {{Integrated development environments for C and C++}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Gnat Programming Studio}} [[Category:Ada programming language]] [[Category:Open source integrated development environments]] [[Category:GNU Project software]] [[Category:Linux integrated development environments]] [[Category:Free cross-platform software]] {{compu-stub}} [[de:GNAT Programming Studio]] [[ru:GNAT Programming Studio]] [[zh:GNAT Programming Studio]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14576</id> <title>GNSS positioning calculation</title> <text>{{Merge|Global navigation satellite system|date=March 2010}} <!--{{nointro}} {{context}}--> The [[global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) positioning for receiver's position is derived through the following calculation steps by using its measurements. ==Calculation steps== # A [[global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) receiver measures the apparent transmitting time, <math>\scriptstyle \tilde{t}_i</math>, or "phase", of GNSS signals emitted from four or more GNSS [[satellite]]s (<math>\scriptstyle i=1,2,3,4,..,n</math> ), simultaneously.<ref name="Misra_Enge">Misra, P. and Enge, P., Global Positioning System: Signals, Measurements, and Performance, 2nd, Ganga-Jamuna Press, 2006.</ref> # GNSS satellites broadcast the messages of satellites' [[ephemeris]], <math>\scriptstyle \boldsymbol{r}_i (t)</math>, and intrinsic clock bias (i.e., clock advance), <math>\scriptstyle\delta t_{\text{clock,sv},i} (t)</math> as the functions of ([[atomic clock|atomic]]) [[standard time]], e.g., [[GPST]].<ref name="IS-GPS">[http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/IS-GPS-200D.pdf The interface specification of NAVSTAR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM]</ref> # The transmitting time of GNSS signals, <math>\scriptstyle t_i</math>, is thus derived from the non-[[closed-form]] [[equations]] <math>\scriptstyle \tilde{t}_i = t_i + \delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t_i)</math> and <math>\scriptstyle \delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t_i) = \delta t_{\text{clock,sv},i} (t_i) + \delta t_{\text{orbit-relativ},i} (\boldsymbol{r}_i, \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i)</math>, where <math>\scriptstyle \delta t_{\text{orbit-relativ},i} (\boldsymbol{r}_i, \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i)</math> is the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] clock bias, periodically risen from the satellite's [[orbital eccentricity]] and Earth's [[gravity field]].<ref name="IS-GPS"/> The satellite's position and velocity are determined by <math>\scriptstyle t_i</math>: <math>\scriptstyle \boldsymbol{r}_i = \boldsymbol{r}_i (t_i)</math> and <math>\scriptstyle \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i = \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i (t_i)</math>. <!-- The satellite's position is derived from <math>\scriptstyle \boldsymbol{r}_i = \boldsymbol{r}_i (t_i)</math>. --> # In the field of GNSS, "geometric range", <math>\scriptstyle r(\boldsymbol{r}_A, \boldsymbol{r}_B) </math>, is defined as straight range
