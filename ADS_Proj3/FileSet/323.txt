appropriate when they were first introduced, but today they are among the largest common connectors used in computers. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== Video In Video Out ==== [[Image:Vivo card.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A graphics card with VGA, VIVO and DVI outputs]] [[Image:Vivo splitter cable.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 6-connector VIVO splitter cable. From left to right: S-Video In, Component P<sub>b</sub> out, Component P<sub>r</sub> out, Component Y out/Composite out, Composite in, S-Video Out]] [[Video In Video Out]], usually seen as the acronym '''VIVO''' (commonly pronounced vee-voh), is a [[Computer port (hardware)|graphics card port]] which enables some [[video card]]s to have [[bidirectional]] (input and output) video transfer through a [[Mini-DIN connector|Mini-DIN]], usually of the 9-pin variety, and a specialised splitter cable (which can sometimes also transfer sound). VIVO is found predominantly on high-end [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] video cards, although a few high-end [[NVIDIA]] video cards also have this port. VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports [[Composite Video|Composite]], [[S-Video]], and [[Component video|Component]] as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement [[Video Graphics Array]] or [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], typically using a component breakout cable and an S-Video cable. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== DVI Connector ==== [[Image:DVI Connector Types.svg|thumb|181px|left|Male DVI connector pins (view of plug)]] [[Image:DVI Connector M1-DA.png|thumb|181px|left|Male M1-DA connector pins (view of plug)]] The [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI) is a video interface standard designed to maximize the visual quality of digital display devices such as flat panel LCD computer displays and digital projectors. It is designed for carrying uncompressed digital video data to a display. There are four basic connectors: <ul type="disc" style="list-style-position: inside;"> <li> '''DVI-D''' (digital only) </li> <li> '''DVI-A''' (analog only) </li> <li> '''DVI-I''' (integrated, digital & analog) </li> <li> '''M1-DA''' (integrated, digital, analog & USB) </li> </ul> The connector also includes provision for a second data link for high resolution displays, though many devices do not implement this. In those that do, the connector is sometimes referred to as '''DVI-DL''' (dual link). So we need to know two things about the connector: <ol style="list-style-position: inside;"> <li>Whether it carries analog, digital, or both; and </li> <li>For connectors that carry digital links, if it is single or dual link, and if it carries USB</li> </ol> <div style="clear:both"></div> === Audio and Video Connectors === ==== RCA Jack ==== [[Image:Composite-cables.jpg|thumb|left|RCA Plugs for [[composite video]] (yellow) and [[Stereophonic sound|stereo audio]] (white and red)]] An [[RCA jack]], also referred to as a phono connector or Cinch connector. These were first used inside pre-World-War-II radio-phonographs to connect the turntable pickup to the radio chassis. They were not intended to be disconnected and reconnected frequently, and their retaining friction was quite sufficient for their original purpose. Furthermore, the design of both cable and chassis connectors was for minimum cost. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== HDMI ==== [[Image:HDMI.socket.png|thumb|left|HDMI Type A socket]] [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface]] (HDMI) is a compact audio/video standard for transmitting uncompressed digital data. There are three HDMI connector types. Type A and Type B were defined by the HDMI 1.0 specification. Type C was defined by the HDMI 1.3 specification. Type A is electrically compatible with single link DVI-D. Type B is electrically compatible with [[Digital_Visual_Interface#Connector|dual link DVI-D]] but has not yet been used in any products. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== Display Port ==== [[Image:DisplayPort Connector.svg|left|200px|pinout_caption=External connector (source-side) on PCB]] [[DisplayPort]] is a digital display interface standard (approved May 2006, current version 1.1a approved on January 11, 2008). It defines a new license-free, royalty-free, digital audio/video interconnect, intended to be used primarily between a computer and its display monitor, or a computer and a home-theater system. The video signal is not compatible with [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]], but a DisplayPort connector can pass these signals through. DisplayPort is a competitor to the HDMI connector, the [[de facto]] digital connection for high-definition consumer electronics devices. <div style="clear:both"></div> ====IEEE 1394 "FireWire"==== [[Image:FireWire-46 Diagram.svg|left|thumb|The 6-circuit and 4-circuit alpha FireWire 400 connectors]] [[IEEE 1394 interface|IEEE 1394 FireWire]] is a digital data transfer protocol commonly used for [[FireWire camera|digital cameras]] (common on MiniDV tape camcorders), but also used for computer data and audio data transfers. In the United States, [[Cable converter box|cable TV converter set top boxes]] by law<ref>http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/FCC_complaint.html All Cable TV box have working 1394 ports, FCC rule CS Docket 97-80" and "section 47 C.F.R. 76.640(b)(4)</ref> also have the connection for transferring content directly to a TV (if equipped with a port) or computer for viewing. 1394 can also use coaxial cable as a medium for longer runs. Unlike Point-to-Point connections listed above, IEEE 1394 is able to host several signals on the same wire, with the data delivered and shown on the destination set. It is also fully bi-directional, with its full bandwidth used in one direction or the other, or split directions up to its maximum.<ref>http://www.1394ta.org/about/HANA/HANA_Presentation_041808.pdf Demonstrating the multi-device capabilities of IEEE A/V network.</ref> == See also == * [[Audio and video connector]] * [[Computer port (hardware)]] * [[List of video connectors]] == References == <references /> == External links == * [http://www.crutchfield.com/learn/learningcenter/home/connections_gallery.html Photos of male and female connector ends] {{Audio and video_interfaces_and_connectors}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Audio And Video Interfaces And Connectors}} [[Category:Audiovisual connectors|Audiovisual connectors]] [[Category:Digital display connectors|Digital display connectors]] [[Category:Computer and telecommunication standards| ]] [[Category:Computer peripherals]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2766</id> <title>Aureal Vortex</title> <text>[[Image:A vortex au8820b2.png|thumb|Sound card with AU8820B2-chip]] The '''Vortex''' audio accelerator chipset line from [[Aureal Semiconductor]] was designed to improve performance of their then-popular [[A3D]] audio technology. The first member of the line, the Vortex AU8820, was announced on July 14, 1997[http://web.archive.org/web/19971014130227/www.aureal.com/press/071497-vortex.html], and was used in by a number of sound card manufacturers, like Yamaha and [[Turtle Beach Systems|Turtle Beach]]. After Aureal's release of A3D 2.0, the Vortex AU8830 (known as the Vortex 2) was announced on August 6, 1998[http://web.archive.org/web/19990827184623/http://aureal.com/cgi-bin/pub/display.pl?template=press_aur_detail.htm&serial=100]. The Vortex 2 chipset won numerous industry awards, and was used among other places in the [[Diamond Multimedia | Diamond]] Monster Sound MX300, which achieved near-cult status with audiophiles and gamers for the high quality of its positional audio. Near the end of Aureal's existence, they released a Vortex Advantage budget sound card aimed at systems integrators, which ran on
