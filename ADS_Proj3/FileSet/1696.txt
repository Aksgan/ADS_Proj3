The remaining national territory and Berlin were partitioned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949, to form the ''[[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]'' (''Bundesrepublik Deutschland''); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the ''[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'' (''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'', or DDR). They were, mainly outside Germany, informally known as "West Germany" and "East Germany", and the two parts of Berlin as "[[West Berlin]]" and "[[East Berlin]]". East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]]. However, West Germany declared the status of its capital Bonn as provisional, in order to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial ''status quo'' that was to be overcome one day.<ref name="provisional">{{cite book | last = Wise | first = Michael Z. | title = Capital dilemma: Germany's search for a new architecture of democracy| year = 1998| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | isbn =9781568981345 | page = 23 | chapter = Bonn, Capital of Self-Effacement}}</ref> West Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a "[[social market economy]]", was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country came to enjoy prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s ({{lang|de|''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''}}). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. On 1 January 1957, following a plebiscite, [[Saarland]] became part of West Germany by virtue of article 23 {{lang|de|''[[Grundgesetz]]''}}, having been occupied by France since 1947. [[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] shortly after its opening in 1989]] East Germany was an [[Eastern bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[USSR]] via the latter's occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. While claiming to be a democracy, political power was solely executed by leading members (''[[Politburo]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED (''Socialist Unity Party of Germany'')]]. Their power was ensured by the [[Stasi]], a secret service of immense size, and a variety of SED suborganizations controlling every aspect of society. In return, the basic needs of the population were satisfied at low cost by the state. A Soviet-style [[command economy]] was set up; later, the GDR became a [[Comecon]] state. While [[Communist propaganda|East German propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.<ref>{{cite news | last = Colchester | first = Nico | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/504285c4-68b6-11da-bd30-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=6f876a3c-e19f-11da-bf4c-0000779e2340.html | title = D-mark day dawns | newspaper = [[Financial Times]] | location = London | date = 1 January 2001 | accessdate = 2006-12-07 }}</ref> The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany, became a symbol of the [[Cold War]]. Tensions between East and West Germany were somewhat reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|''[[Ostpolitik]]''}}, which included the ''de facto'' acceptance of Germany's territorial losses in World War II. In summer 1989, Hungary decided (2 May) to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders (23 August), causing an exodus of thousands of [[East Germans]] (September 11) to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the [[GDR]], with [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]]. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions in November, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West. Originally intended as a pressure valve to retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the [[Die Wende|''Wende'' reform process]] in East Germany, which finally concluded with the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender, and Germany regained full [[sovereignty]]. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states in the former GDR ([[New states of Germany|new states]] or "neue Länder"). ===Berlin Republic and the EU 1990–Present=== {{Main|History of Germany since 1990}} [[File:Euro banknotes.png|thumb| A new currency, the [[Euro]], began circulating on 1 January 2002.<ref name=euroc/>]] Based on the Bonn-Berlin Act, adopted by the parliament on 10 March 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a ''Bundesstadt'' (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.<ref>{{de icon}} [http://www.wdr.de/themen/politik/nrw03/bonn_berlin/060914.jhtml?rubrikenstyle=politik Landtag einstimmig gegen Komplettumzug]{{dead link|date=September 2010}} WDR; 14 September 2006.</ref><ref>{{de icon}} [http://www.wdr.de/themen/politik/deutschland/bonn_berlin/060619.jhtml?rubrikenstyle=politik Deutschlands heimliche Hauptstadt Landtag einstimmig gegen Komplettumzug]{{dead link|date=September 2010}} WDR; 20 June 2006.</ref> The relocation of the government was completed in 1999.
