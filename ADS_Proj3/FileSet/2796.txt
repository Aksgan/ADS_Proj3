The mission is managed for [[NASA]] by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], which designed, built, and is operating the rovers. ==Objectives== The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission are to:<ref>[http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/science/objectives.html The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover]</ref> *Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and soils that hold clues to past [[Water on Mars|water]] activity. In particular, samples sought include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]], or [[hydrothermal activity]]. *Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites. *Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering. *Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey Martian geology from orbit. *Search for [[iron]]-containing minerals, and to identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates. *Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils to determine the processes that created them. *Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present. *Assess whether those environments were conducive to [[life]]. During the next two decades, NASA will conduct several missions to address whether life ever existed on Mars. The search begins with determining whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life, as humans understand it, requires water, so the history of water on Mars is critical to finding out if the Martian environment was ever conducive to life. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers do not have the ability to detect life directly, they offer important information on the habitability of the environment in the planet's history [[Image:Shadow-2F130642164EDN09BVP1402R0M1-A049R1 br.jpg|thumb|right|NASA's Mars Exploration Rover ''Spirit'' casts a shadow over the trench that the rover is examining with tools on its robotic arm.

The rover transmitted a message with no data, but later that day missed another communications session with the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]. The next day, [[JPL]] received a beep from the rover, indicating that it was in fault mode. On January 23, the flight team succeeded in making the rover send. The fault was believed to have been caused by an error in the rover's [[flash memory]] subsystem. The rover did not perform any scientific activities for ten days, while engineers updated its software and ran tests. The problem was corrected by reformatting ''Spirit'''s flash memory and using a [[software patch]] to avoid memory overload; ''Opportunity'' was also upgraded with the patch as a precaution. ''Spirit'' returned to full scientific operations by February 5. On March 23, 2004, a news conference was held announcing "major discoveries" of evidence of past liquid [[water]] on the Martian surface. A delegation of scientists showed pictures and data revealing a stratified pattern and [[cross bedding]] in the rocks of the outcrop inside a crater in [[Meridiani Planum]], landing site of [[MER-B|MER-B, ''Opportunity'']]. This suggested that water once flowed in the region. The irregular distribution of [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]] also suggests that the place was once the shoreline of a salty sea, now evaporated. On April 8, 2004, NASA announced that it was extending the mission life of the rovers from three to eight months. It immediately provided additional funding of US $15 million through September, and $2.8 million per month for continuing operations. Later that month, ''Opportunity'' arrived at [[Endurance (crater)|Endurance crater]], taking about five days to drive the 200 meters. NASA announced on September 22 that it was extending the mission life of the rovers for another six months. ''Opportunity'' was to
