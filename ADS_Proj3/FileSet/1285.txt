It was previously known as the EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing. The overall aim of the journal is to bring science and applications together with emphasis on both theoretical and practical aspects of [[signal processing]] in new and [[emerging technologies]]. It is directed as much at the practicing engineer as at the academic researcher. The journal highlights the extended reach and the diverse applications of signal processing and encourage a cross-fertilization of techniques. All papers should attempt to bring theory to life with practical simulations and examples. The journal employs paperless, electronic review process to foster fast and speedy turnaround in review process. Application areas include (but are not limited to): communications, networking, sensors and actuators, radar and sonar, [[medical imaging]], biomedical applications, [[remote sensing]], [[consumer electronics]], [[computer vision]], [[pattern recognition]], robotics, [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] sensing/transducers, [[Automation|industrial automation]], transportation, [[stock market]] and [[financial analysis]], seismography, avionics. == References == *[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/asp/ journal website] ==See also== *[http://www.doaj.org/ Directory of Open Access Journals] {{DEFAULTSORT:Eurasip Journal On Advances In Signal Processing}} [[Category:Computer science journals]] [[Category:Open access journals]] [[Category:Machine learning]] [[Category:Publications established in 2001]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11523</id> <title>EUREKA Prometheus Project</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=November 2007}} The [[EUREKA]] Prometheus Project ('''''PRO'''gra'''M'''me for a '''E'''uropean '''T'''raffic of '''H'''ighest '''E'''fficiency and '''U'''nprecedented '''S'''afety'', 1987-1995) was the largest R&D project ever in the field of [[driverless car]]s. In today's money it received more than 1 billion dollars of funding from the [[European Commission]], and defined the state of the art of [[autonomous]] vehicles. Numerous universities and car manufacturers participated in this [[Pan-European]] project. Prometheus profited from the participation of [[Ernst Dickmanns]], the 1980s pioneer of [[driverless car]]s, and his team at Bundeswehr Universität München, collaborating with [[Daimler-Benz]]. A first culmination point was achieved in 1994, when their twin robot vehicles [[VaMP]] and VITA-2 drove more than one thousand kilometers on a [[Paris]] multi-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to 130 km/h. They demonstrated autonomous driving in free lanes, [[convoy]] driving, automatic [[tracking]] of other vehicles, and lane changes left and right with autonomous passing of other cars. The next culmination point was achieved in 1995, when Dickmanns´ re-engineered autonomous [[S-Class]] Mercedes-Benz took a 1000 mile trip from [[Munich]] in [[Bavaria]] to [[Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]] and back, using [[saccadic]] computer vision and [[transputer]]s to react in real time. The robot achieved speeds exceeding 175 km/h on the [[Germany|German]] [[Autobahn]], with a mean time between human interventions of 9 km. In traffic it executed manoeuvres to pass other cars. Despite being a research system without emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to 158 km without any human intervention. The achievements of Prometheus were the basis for most subsequent work on [[driverless car]]s. == Participants == {{Expand section|date=May 2010}} * [[Ernst Dickmanns]] and team of [[Bundeswehr University of Munich]] * [[Daimler-Benz]] * Numerous others (to be completed) == See also == * [[Driverless car]] * [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] * [[ARGO]] Project on autonomous cars * [[ELROB]] trials * [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&client=safari&rls=en&q=eureka+prometheus+project&btnG=Search Numerous links on the EUREKA Prometheus project] {{DEFAULTSORT:Eureka Prometheus Project}} [[Category:Robotics competitions]] [[Category:Driverless cars]] [[Category:Science competitions]] [[de:Prometheus (Forschungsprogramm)]] [[ja:EUREKA プロメテウス計画]] [[sv:EUREKA Prometheus Project]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11528</id> <title>EVA (benchmark)</title> <text>'''EVA''' is a continuously running [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] project for assessing the quality of [[protein structure prediction]] and [[secondary structure prediction]] methods. Methods for predicting both [[secondary structure]] and [[tertiary structure]] - including [[homology modeling]], [[protein threading]], and [[contact order]] prediction - are compared to results from each week's newly solved [[protein structure]]s deposited in the [[Protein Data Bank]]. The project aims to determine the prediction accuracy that would be expected for non-expert users of common, publicly available prediction [[webserver]]s; this is similar to the related [[LiveBench]] project and stands in contrast to the bi-yearly benchmark [[CASP]], which aims to identify the maximum accuracy achievable by prediction experts. ==References== * Rost B, Eyrich VA.
