EASE was formed in May 1982 in Pau, France, from the European Life Science Editors' Association (ELSE) and the European Association of Earth Science Editors (Editerra). == Affiliations == EASE is affiliated to the [[International Union of Biological Sciences]] (IUBS), and the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS), has category A liaison status with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (Technical Committee 46/subcommittee 9) (ISO) and is represented on committees of the [[British Standards Institution]]. Through its affiliation to IUBS and IUGS the Association is also affiliated to the [[International Council for Science|International Council of Scientific Unions]] (ICSU) and is thereby in formal associate relations with [[UNESCO]]. EASE cooperates actively with the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) and the [[Association of Earth Science Editors]] (AESE) in North America. Its other links include the [[African Association of Science Editors]], the [[European Medical Writers Association]] (EMWA), the [[Finnish Association of Science Editors and Journalists]] (FASEJ), the [[Society of English-Native-Speaking Editors]] (Netherlands) (SENSE), [[AuthorAID]], and, in the UK, the [[Association for Learned and Professional Society Publishers]] (ALPSP) and the [[Society for Editors and Proofreaders]] (SfEP). The European Association of Science Editors is a Company Limited by Guarantee, Registered in England and Wales - Company Number 4049507.

In 2008 the ECB ended. Some of its activities were taken over by the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA; others remained within the Joint Research Council's "Institute for Health & Consumer Protection", IHCP.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = | journal = European Chemicals Bureau Newsletter | volume = | issue = 2008, special edition | pages = | date = | year = | url = http://ecb.jrc.it/newsletter/newsletter200802.pdf | doi = | id = }} </ref> The ECB was located in [[Ispra]], [[Italy]]. It was under the responsibility of the [[Institute for Health and Consumer Protection]] (IHCP) of the [[Joint Research Centre]] (JRC) of the [[European Commission]]. == Mission == The mission of the ECB was to provide scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies related to dangerous chemicals. It co-ordinateed the EU [[risk assessment]] programmes that covered the risks posed by existing substances and new substances to workers, consumers and the environment. It supported the legal classification and labeling, the notification of new substances, the information exchange on import and export of dangerous substances, the development and harmonization of testing methods and the authorization of [[biocide]]s.<br /> == Biocides == The [[Biocides]] Work Area provided scientific and technical support for the approval of active substances in biocidal products as laid down in [[Directive 98/8/EC]] concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market. == Existing Chemicals == The Existing Chemicals Work Area provided technical and scientific support to the Commission concerning the data collection, priority setting, and risk assessment steps of Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93. == New Chemicals == The principal function of the New Chemicals work area were: * Co-ordination of EU notification scheme and risk assessment for new chemical substances (Directive 67/548/EEC including Annexes VII and VIII, Directive 93/67/EEC). * Management of the New Chemicals Database (NCD) maintained in a security area with authorised access only. * Preparation of European LIst of Notified Chemical Substances (ELINCS). * Supervision of Technical and Scientific Meetings (TSMs) and Working Group Meetings allowing Member State Competent Authorities to discuss issues arising related to implementation of Directives. == ESIS == The [[European chemical Substances Information System]] (ESIS) is an IT system that provides information on chemicals in different lists. == See also == * [[Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals|REACH]] * [[IUCLID]] == References == <references/> == External links == * [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ Ex-ECB] The official website is still available. ** [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/biocides/ Biocides] ** [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/classification-labelling/ Classification & Labelling] ** [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/qsar/ Computational Toxicology] ** [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/existing-chemicals/ Existing Chemicals] ** [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/import-export/ Export-Import Control] ** [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/new-chemicals/ New Chemicals] ** [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/testing-methods/ Test Methods] * [http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esis/ ESIS (European chemical Substances Information System)] [[Category:Environmental law]] [[Category:Cheminformatics]] [[Category:European Union and science and technology]] [[Category:Science and technology in Europe]] [[de:Europ채isches B체ro f체r Chemische Stoffe]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12581</id> <title>European Conference on Computer Vision</title> <text>'''ECCV''', the '''European Conference on Computer Vision''', is a bi-annual research conference organised by the [[IEEE]].

The acceptance rate for ECCV 2006 was 17% posters and 4%.<ref>[http://www.adaptivebox.net/CILib/CICON_stat.html#ECCV Conference Acceptance Ratio Statistics]</ref> Like many IEEE conferences, ECCV has tutorial talks, technical sessions, and poster sessions. The conference is usually spread over four to five days. Leading experts in the focus areas
