depends heavily on the plant’s data base and its communications with all manufacturing work centers, EIS also provides an approach to improve production planning and control. === Marketing === In an organization, marketing executives’ role is to create the future. Their main duty is managing available marketing resources to create a more effective future. For this, they need make judgments about risk and uncertainty of a project and its impact on the company in short term and long term. To assist marketing executives in making effective marketing decisions, an EIS can be applied. EIS provides an approach to sales forecasting, which can allow the market executive to compare sales forecast with past sales. EIS also offers an approach to product price, which is found in venture analysis. The market executive can evaluate pricing as related to competition along with the relationship of product quality with price charged. In summary, EIS software package enables marketing executives to manipulate the data by looking for trends, performing audits of the sales data, and calculating totals, averages, changes, variances, or ratios. All of these sales analysis functions help marketing executives to make final decisions. === Financial === A financial analysis is one of the most important steps to companies today. The executive needs to use financial ratios and cash flow analysis to estimate the trends and make capital investment decisions. An EIS is a responsibility-oriented approach that integrates planning or budgeting with control of performance reporting, and it can be extremely helpful to finance executives. Basically, EIS focuses on accountability of financial performance and it recognizes the importance of cost standards and flexible budgeting in developing the quality of information provided for all executive levels. EIS enables executives to focus more on the long-term basis of current year and beyond, which means that the executive not only can manage a sufficient flow to maintain current operations but also can figure out how to expand operations that are contemplated over the coming years. Also, the combination of EIS and [[EDI]] environment can help cash managers to review the company’s financial structure so that the best method of financing for an accepted capital project can be concluded. In addition, the EIS is a good tool to help the executive to review financial ratios, highlight financial trends and analyze a company’s performance and its competitors. == Advantages and Disadvantages EIS == === Advantages of EIS === * Easy for upper-level executives to use, extensive computer experience is not required in operations * Provides timely delivery of company summary information * Information that is provided is better understood * Filters data for management * Improves to tracking information * Offers efficiency to decision makers === Disadvantages of EIS === * System dependent * Limited functionality, by design * Information overload for some managers * Benefits hard to quantify * High implementation costs * System may become slow, large, and hard to manage * Need good internal processes for data management * May lead to less reliable and less secure data * == Future Trends == The future of executive info systems will not be bound by mainframe computer systems. This trend allows executives escaping from learning different computer operating systems and substantially decreases the implementation costs for companies. Because utilizing existing software applications lies in this trend, executives will also eliminate the need to learn a new or special language for the EIS package. Future executive information systems will not only provide a system that supports senior executives, but also contain the information needs for middle managers. The future executive information systems will become diverse because of integrating potential new applications and technology into the systems, such as incorporating [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and integrating multimedia characteristics and [[ISDN]] technology into an EIS. EIS - timely, efficient and effective in supporting the decision making process. == See also == * [[Enterprise architecture]] * [[Management information system]] == References == {{Nofootnotes|date=September 2008}} {{reflist}} {{refbegin}} * Thierauf, Robert J.

When a person leaves the place where they worked or studied, they may leave behind [[logon]]s with access to [[Computer network|networks]]. They may also take with them knowledge of many kinds of [[password]]s outside of the network, such as building security codes or banking passwords. It is important that steps are taken to disable or negate all of those access privileges when a person leaves, to ensure that security integrity is maintained. Exit Procedures, as they are known, should be in place at every work and school location. An Exit Procedure will also cover other issues such as the recovery
