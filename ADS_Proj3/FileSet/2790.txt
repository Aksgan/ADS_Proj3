recommendations to avoid accidents in the future. Marine accident [[detective|investigator]]s have both national and international [[professional organization]]s. [[IMO]] requires all flag States of their registered ships to investigate and report serious marine accidents. National Administration usually assign their Professional Investigators conduct marine accident investigation by interview of witnesses, collect evidences and data for accident analysis, the probable causes and findings of the accident are concluded and recommendation are suggested to prevent future occurrence of similar accident in the final accident investigation report for public. [[Voyage Data Recorder]] (VDR) are now installed on most of the ocean going vessel according to the [[IMO]] requirement, VDR have made a substantial contribution to the understanding of accident causes and the improvement of safety. Recorded data has enabled accident investigators to reconstruct events to identify precisely what went wrong and to ensure that effective, rather than convenient, more reliable recommendations can be made to prevent the same thing happening again from the correct lessons learned. ==External links== * [http://www.maiif.org Marine Accident Investigators' International Forum (MAIIF)] * [http://maifa.info Marine Accident Investigators Meeting in the Asia Region (MAIFA)] * [http://www.maib.gov.uk Marine Accident Investigation Branch (UK)] * [http://www.ntsb.gov/Surface/marine/marine.htm NTSB (US)] * [http://www.mardep.gov.hk/en/publication/ereport.html Marine Department (HK)] * [http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/uses/transportation_telecomm/maritime_trans/nav/navigation.htm Navigation Safety at Sea] [[Category:Accidents]] [[Category:Failure]] [[Category:Risk analysis]] [[Category:Maritime safety]] [[Category:Maritime incidents]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23477</id> <title>Mario Szegedy</title> <text>{{Infobox Scientist | name = Mario Szegedy | image = Mario_Szegedy_at_Rutgers_2008.jpg | caption = | birth_date = | birth_place = | death_date = | death_place = | residence = [[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|20px|]] [[United States|U.S.]] | nationality = | field = [[Computer Science]] | work_institution = [[Rutgers University]] | alma_mater = [[University of Chicago]] | doctoral_advisor = [[László Babai]], Janos Simon }} '''Mario Szegedy''' (born October 23, 1960) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[computer scientist]], [[professor]] of [[computer science]] at [[Rutgers University]].

Mariposa focused on creating wide-area distributed databases using an economic model in which querying servers "buy" data from data servers which "sell" it. The result is a network of servers that quickly reaches a best-performance point. Other distributed [[RDBMS]]s rely on a heavyweight solution for moving data in which every server maintains a complete copy of the "master" database. While this works with private databases of small size, it simply cannot work with thousands of servers with aggregate data sets on the order of those being commonly found on the [[Internet]]. Mariposa uses an entirely different paradigm for distribution in which each server includes only the data it needs, but maintains links to other servers and knows what data they contain. If the data needs of a particular server mean it is constantly "buying" data from another server, notably one with a high cost (say on the far side of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]), the servers will automatically copy the data over. Mariposa's system is also largely automatic. Traditional systems require the dedicated resources of a database administrator in order to maintain performance as the data load changes over time, whereas in Mariposa the basic system will automatically handle such cases. Unlike Stonebraker's earlier efforts which were groundbreaking, Mariposa seems to have had little effect on the marketplace as a whole to date. The project has since ended. ==External links== *[http://s2k-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:8000/mariposa/ Mariposa] [[Category:Database management systems]] [[Category:Research projects]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23482</id> <title>Marissa Mayer</title> <text>{{BLP sources|date=December 2009}} {{Infobox person | name = Marissa Ann Mayer | hotness = Much Hotness | image = Marissa_Mayer.jpg | birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1975|5|30|df=y}} | birth_place = [[Wausau]], [[Wisconsin]]<br />[[United States]]<br />[[North America]] | residence = [[San Francisco]], [[Palo Alto]] | nationality = American | alma_mater = [[Stanford University]] | employer = [[Google]]<br />[[Stanford University]] | occupation = Vice President, Search Products & User Experience, [[Google]]<ref>[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/execs.html#marissa google.com: Corporate Information - Google Management]</ref><br />Computer programming instructor, [[Stanford University]] | spouse = Zachary Bogue (2009–present)<ref>[http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/vd-the-bride-wore-snowflakes/ Vogue: The Bride Wore Snowflakes]</ref> }} '''Marissa Ann Mayer''' (born on 30 May 1975) is vice president of consumer products<ref name="New York Times Bits Blog: At Google, Mayer Takes a New Job">[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/google-search-executive-marissa-mayer-takes-a-new-job/]</ref> at the [[search engine]] company [[Google]].
