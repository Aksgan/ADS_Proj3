bandpass frequency response of each is shown and is described in the article text.|'''Figure 11.''' Schematic bridging arrangements and their effect on frequency response.]] The method of coupling between non-adjacent resonators is not limited to mechanical filters. It can be applied to other filter formats. For instance, channels can be cut between [[cavity resonator]]s, [[mutual inductance]] can be used with discrete component filters, and feedback paths can be used with active [[analogue filter|analogue]] or [[digital filter]]s. Nor was the method first discovered in the field of mechanical filters; the earliest description is in a 1948 patent for filters using [[microwave]] cavity resonators.<ref>J. R. Pierce, "Guided-wave frequency range transducer," U.S. Patent 2,626,990, filed {{Nowrap|4 May}} 1948, issued {{Nowrap|27 January}} 1953.</ref> However, mechanical filter designers were the first (1960s) to develop practical filters of this kind and the method became a particular feature of mechanical filters.<ref>Levy and Cohn, pp.1060–1061.</ref> ==Microelectromechanical filters== {{See also|RF MEMS#Filters}} [[Image:MEMS Microcantilever in Resonance.png|thumb|alt=A [[microphotograph]] of a vibrating cantilever. Cursors on the picture indicate that the [[peak-to-peak]] amplitude of the vibration is 17.57μm.|'''Figure 12.''' MEMS cantilever resonator. The device can be seen to be vibrating in this picture.]] A new technology emerging in mechanical filtering is [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS). MEMS are very small [[micromachine]]s with component sizes measured in [[micrometre]]s (μm), but not as small as [[nanotechnology|nanomachines]]. These systems are mostly fabricated from [[silicon]] (Si), [[silicon nitride]] (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), or [[polymer]]s. A common component used for [[radio frequency]] filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the [[cantilever]] resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, [[photolithography]] and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.<ref>de los Santos, pp.167–183.</ref> The resonator shown in figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30 GHz have been produced using cantilever [[varactor]]s as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5 mm.<ref>de los Santos, p.169.</ref> Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200 MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, can be used in the microwave bands.<ref>de los Santos, p.167.</ref> Extremely high ''Q'' resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a ''Q'' in excess of 80,000 at 8 MHz are reported.<ref>de los Santos, p.171.</ref> ==Adjustment== The precision applications in which mechanical filters are used require that the resonators are accurately adjusted to the specified resonance frequency. This is known as ''trimming'' and usually involves a mechanical machining process. In most filter designs, this can be difficult to do once the resonators have been assembled into the complete filter so the resonators are trimmed before assembly. Trimming is done in at least two stages; coarse and fine, with each stage bringing the resonance frequency closer to the specified value. Most trimming methods involve removing material from the resonator which will increase the resonance frequency. The target frequency for a coarse trimming stage consequently needs to be set below the final frequency since the [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]] of the process could otherwise result in a frequency higher than the following fine trimming stage could adjust for.<ref name=Johnson245>Johnson, 1983, p.245.</ref><ref name=Kasai>Kasai ''et al.'', cols.1–2</ref> The coarsest method of trimming is [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] of the main resonating surface of the resonator; this process has an accuracy of around {{nowrap|±800 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]]}}. Better control can be achieved by grinding the edge of the resonator instead of the main surface. This has a less dramatic effect and consequently better accuracy. Processes that can be used for fine trimming, in order of increasing accuracy, are [[Abrasive blasting|sandblasting]], drilling, and [[laser ablation]]. Laser trimming is capable of achieving an accuracy of {{nowrap|±40 ppm}}.<ref name=Kasai/><ref>Johnson, 1983, pp.245–246.</ref> Trimming by hand, rather than machine, was used on some early production components but would now normally only be encountered during product development. Methods available include [[sanding]] and [[File (tool)|filing]]. It is also possible to add material to the resonator by hand, thus reducing the resonance frequency. One such method is to add [[solder]], but this is not suitable for production use since the solder will tend to reduce the high ''Q'' of the resonator.<ref name=Johnson245/> In the case of MEMS filters, it is not possible to trim the resonators outside of the filter because of the integrated nature of the device construction. However, trimming is still a requirement in many MEMS applications. Laser ablation can be used for this but material deposition methods are available as well as material removal. These methods include [[Pulsed laser deposition|laser]] or [[Ion beam deposition|ion-beam induced deposition]].<ref>Lin ''et al.'', p.293.</ref> ==See also== *[[Ceramic resonator]] *[[Surface acoustic wave]] *[[Crystal oscillator]] *[[Crystal filter]] ==Footnotes== {{reflist|group=n|2}} ==References== {{reflist|3}} ==Bibliography== {{refbegin|2}} *Blanchard, J.
