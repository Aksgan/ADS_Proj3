started expanding many goals were added rapidly, and it was obvious that JetPAG is worthy being a complete project. Real development of JetPAG started in late 2005, targeting a complete framework for a powerful [[Recursive descent parser|recursive descent]] lexical analyzer and parser generator with emphasis on ease of use, code readability and high performance of generated code. After a long period of in-house development and testing, the first development package of JetPAG was released through [[SourceForge]] in 18 November 2006. Development of JetPAG is current at [[Software release life cycle|beta stage]], current version is 0.6.1. The development was delayed from mid-2007 until early 2009 but resumed after. ==Overview== Jetpag incorporates several modules: the front end, the analyzers and the code generators. The front end accepts the grammar metalanguages as an input. The analyzers mainy perform two operations through [[tree traversal]]. The first is calculating strong [[lookahead]] sets for the elements in the grammar and the second is constructing lookahead paths from the lookahead sets. Lookahead paths group, factorize and perform many enhancements and [[Optimization (computer science)|optimizations]] to lookahead sets using special analysis. From lookahead paths lookahead sets are transformed to a nested tree form, gaining a great overall efficiency and improvement in [[Best, worst and average case|most cases]]. Code generators generate source code for recognizers compatible with the input grammars based on them along with information collected from the analyzers. Currently JetPAG generates source code in C++ only. The nature of JetPAG's metalanguage and framework make it easy and simple to integrate generated recognizers into larger applications. JetPAG also includes some facilities in the provided framework to aid developers with small utilities and save development time from many minimal language recognition tasks. ==JetPAG grammars== JetPAG's garmmars are written in a [[Metalanguage|meta language]] based on the [[EBNF]] form and [[regular expressions]], with extensive additions and tweaks. Th meta language of JetPAG grammars was designed to be maximally flexible handle both simple grammars and large, complicated ones easily. Parsers and lexical analyzers are simillary defined and generated for simplicity and ease of use. This is a simple example of a grammar for a basic calculator: <pre> grammar Calc: parser CalcP: expression: multiplicative ( '+' multiplicative | '-' multiplicative )* ; multiplicative: factor ( '*' factor | '/' factor )* ; factor: INT | '(' expression ')' ; scanner CalcS: INT: '0'-'9'+; PLUS: '+'; MINUS: '-'; STAR: '*'; SLASH: '/'; LP: '('; RP: ')'; </pre> ==See also== * [[LL parser|LL recognizers]] * [[ANTLR]] * [[JavaCC]] * [[Coco/R]] ==External links== * [http://jetpag.sourceforge.net/ JetPAG Homepage] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jetpag/ JetPAG at SourceForge] [[Category:Parser generators]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19894</id> <title>JetStream (software)</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = JetStream| screenshot = <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SpecRoamer1.png|thumb|Screenshot of JetStream]] -->| caption = | developer = [[Autodesk]] | owner = Autodesk | latest_release_version = 5.5 | latest_release_date = [[2007]] | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] | genre = [[3D computer graphics]] | license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] | website = [http://www.navisworks.com www.navisworks.com] }} '''JetStream''' is a 3D design review package for Microsoft Windows. Used primarily in construction industries to complement 3D design packages (such as [[Autodesk Revit]], [[AutoCAD]], and [[MicroStation]]) JetStream allows users to open and combine 3D models, navigate around them in real-time and review the model using a set of tools including comments, redlining, viewpoint, and measurements. A selection of plug-ins enhances the package adding interference detection, 4D time simulation, photorealistic rendering and PDF-like publishing. JetStream, was originally created by [[Sheffield|Sheffield, UK]] based developer NavisWorks (a subsidiary of Lightwork Design) however NavisWorks was purchased by [[Autodesk]] for $25 million in cash, on June 1, 2007.<ref>[http://investors.autodesk.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=117861&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1009450&highlight= Press Release]</ref> == Components == JetStream is built around a core module called '''Roamer''' and has a number of plug-in modules that can be purchased separately. * '''Roamer''' - The core part of JetStream allows users to open models from a range of 3D design and laser scan formats and combine them into a single 3D model. Users can then navigate around the model in real-time and add review the model with a range of mark-up tools. * '''Publisher''' - This plug-in allows users to publish the complete 3D model into a single nwd file that can be freely opened by anyone using Freedom, a free viewer. * '''Clash Detective''' - A plug-in to enable interference detection. This means users can select parts of the model and look for places where the geometry conflicts. This is for finding faults in the design. * '''Presenter''' - With Presenter users can apply materials and lighting to the model and produce photorealistic images and animations * '''TimeLiner''' - Adds 4D simulation so the user can link geometry to times and dates and to simulate the construction or demolition of the model over time. Also links with project scheduling software (Such as Microsoft Project or Primavera products) to import task data. * '''RVM Reader''' - Adds the ability to load .rvm and associated .rvs files generated by AVEVA Plant Design Management System (PDMS). ==File format support== JetStream is most notable for its support of a wide range of competing design packages. Formats natively supported include: * [[NavisWorks]] - .nwd .nwf .nwc * [[AutoCAD]] - .dwg .dxf * [[MicroStation]] - .dgn .prp .prw (As of V 5.5 DGN v8 is not supported natively.) * [[3D Studio]] - .3ds .prj * [[ASCII]] Laser File - .asc .txt * [[DWF]] - .dwf * [[Faro]] - .fls .fws .iQscan .iQmod .iQwsp * [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] - .ifc * [[IGES]] - .igs .iges * [[Informatix]] - .man .cv7 * [[Autodesk Inventor|Inventor]] - .ipt .iam .ipj * [[Leica Camera|Leica]] - .pts .ptx * [[Riegl]] - .3dd * [[RVM]] - .rvm (Requires additional license) * [[SketchUp]] - .skp * [[STEP]] - .stp .step * [[STL (file format)|STL]] - .stl * [[VRML]] - .wrl .wrz * [[Z+F UK|Z+F]] - .zfc .zfs Additional packages are supported through exporters: * [[Revit]] * [[MicroStation]] (Greater file fidelity than the native file reader) * [[3DS Max]] * [[ArchiCAD]] == Version history == The product was originally called NavisWorks (the same name as the company
