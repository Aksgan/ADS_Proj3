Japanese Manufacturing Techniques: Nine Hidden Lessons in Simplicity, New York: Free Press.</ref> Some commonly mentioned goals are: * Improve quality: To stay competitive in today’s marketplace, a company must understand its customers' wants and needs and design processes to meet their expectations and requirements. * Eliminate waste: Waste is any activity that consumes time, resources, or space but does not add any value to the product or service. See [[Lean Manufacturing|Types of waste]], above. Taking the first letter of each waste, the acronym "TIM WOOD" is formed. This is a common way to remember the wastes. The other alternative name that can used to remember is "DOT WIMP". * Reduce time: Reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs. * Reduce total costs: To minimize cost, a company must produce only to customer demand. Overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs because of storage needs. The strategic elements of Lean can be quite complex, and comprise multiple elements. Four different notions of Lean have been identified:<ref name="Pettersen">Pettersen, J., 2009. Defining lean production: some conceptual and practical issues.

In this type of production setting, inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customer’s order. The benefits of this goal include: <ref name="autogenerated1"/>: * decreased cycle time * less inventory * increased productivity * increased capital equipment utilization === There is always room for improvement === The core of lean is founded on the concept of continuous product and process improvement and the elimination of non-value added activities. “The Value adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for, everything else is waste, and should be eliminated, simplified, reduced, or integrated”(Rizzardo, 2003). Improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customer's required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventory. <ref name="autogenerated1"/> === Continuously improve === A continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach a company's goals. The term "continuous improvement" means incremental improvement of products, processes, or services over time, with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality, customer service, or product performance (Suzaki, 1987). Stephen Shortell (Professor of Health Services Management and Organisational Behaviour – Berkeley University, California) states:- “For improvement to flourish it must be carefully cultivated in a rich soil bed (a receptive organisation), given constant attention (sustained leadership), assured the right amounts of light (training and support) and water (measurement and data) and protected from damaging." === Measure === [[Overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE) is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a Lean environment. ==See also== {{col-begin}} {{col-2}} === Closely related methodologies === *[[Toyota Production System]] *[[Lean accounting]] *[[Value Network]] *[[Demand Flow Technology]] *[[Theory of Constraints]] *[[Variation Management]] *[[SCOR]] *[[Six Sigma]] *[[Business process management]] *[[Statistical process control]] *[[Lean Dynamics]] *[[Quick Response Manufacturing]] === Predictive validation techniques === *[[Discrete event simulation]] === Terminology === *[[Training Within Industry]] *[[Lean accounting]] *[[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time or JIT]] *[[Fixed Repeating Schedule|Fixed Repeating Schedule or FRS]] *[[Kaizen]] *[[SMED]] *[[Poka-Yoke]] *[[Autonomation]] and [[Jidoka]] *[[5S (methodology)|5S]] *[[Production levelling]] *[[Cycle Time Variation]] *[[muda (Japanese term)|muda]], [[mura (Japanese term)|mura]], [[muri (Japanese term)|muri]] *[[workcell]] *[[Takt time]] *[[Andon (manufacturing)|Andon]] *[[Genchi Genbutsu]] *[[Gemba]] *[[5 Whys]] {{col-break}} === Related engineering disciplines === *[[Industrial engineering]] *[[Industrial technology]] === Areas of implementation outside production === *[[Computer-Aided Lean Management]] *[[Lean construction]] *[[Lean consumption]] *[[Lean Integration]] *[[Lean laboratory]] *[[Lean Services]] *[[Lean IT]] *[[Lean software development]] *[[Lean accounting]] *[[Lean Government]] *[[Lean Office]] *[[Lean Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO)]] *[[Lean logistics]] === Other === *[[Overall Equipment Effectiveness]] *[[Cellular manufacturing]] *[[Agile manufacturing]] *[[Manufacturing]] *[[Preorder Economy]] *[[Reengineering|Process Reengineering]] *[[Training Within Industry]] *[[Value Stream Mapping]] *[[3D's]] Dirty, Dangerous and Difficult *[[Systems thinking]] *[[Oscillatory baffled reactor]] *[[Value curve analysis]] *[[Inventory management software]] {{col-end}} ==References== {{Reflist|2}} *MacInnes, Richard L.
