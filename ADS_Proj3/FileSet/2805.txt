It was developed by [[Vicious Cycle Software]] and [[1st Playable Productions]] and published by [[Konami]]. The game is based on [[Upper Deck Entertainment|Upper Deck Entertainment's]] [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics-based]] [[collectible card game]], and was released across all three platforms in several regions in 2007. ''Marvel Trading Card Game'' is a virtual card game in which the player chooses to be either a [[superhero]] or [[supervillain]] in [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode. [[Multiplayer]] modes are also available. The game follows the rules laid out in Upper Deck's [[VS System]], used in card games across several franchises including Marvel, [[DC Comics]], and [[Hellboy]]. The game received mixed reviews from critics. It was considered faithful to the physical version, but reviewers commented that it was not accessible to players who weren't already fans of collectible card games. The handheld versions were criticized for presenting a visual format inappropriate for small screens. ==Gameplay== {{main|VS System}} ''Marvel Trading Card Game'' is a [[collectible card game]] with similarities to other card games, like ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.<ref name="ignpspreview" /> The game was designed to portray the [[VS System]] rules exactly the same as the physical version,<ref name="mcint">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/vgstories.918|title=From the Tabletop to the Screen|last=Draudt|first=Greg|date=07-11-2007|publisher=Marvel Comics|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref> created by [[baseball card]] manufacturer [[Upper Deck Entertainment]].<ref name="gspotannouncee3">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/strategy/marveltradingcardgame/news.html?sid=6149288&mode=news|title=E3 06: Marvel card game decks PCs, portables|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|date=05-09-2006|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> Players start each match with a premade deck of [[Playing cards|cards]],<ref name="ignpspreview">{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/769/769139p1.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Review (PSP)|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|date=2007-02-28|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> from which they draw a number of cards to form a hand.
