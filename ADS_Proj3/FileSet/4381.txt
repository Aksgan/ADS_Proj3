so very obvious and simple''". ([http://www.thomasfowler.org.uk/ Fowler, 1840]) ==The future== With the advent of mass-produced binary components for computers, ternary computers have diminished to a small footnote in the history of computing. However, ternary logic's elegance and efficiency is predicted by [[Donald Knuth]] to bring them back into development in the future.<ref>D.E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming - Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms, pp. 190-192. Addison-Wesley, 2nd ed., 1980. ISBN 0-201-03822-6.</ref> Possible ways on how this can happen is by the combination of an [[optical computer]] with the [[ternary logic]] system.<ref>[http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1402-4896/2005/T118/025/ Ternary Optical Computer]</ref> The simple way to explain this is to compare it to binary. In a binary computer, normally electronic computing, there are two values 1 or ON and 0 or OFF. A ternary computer using fiber optics could use three values: 0 or OFF, 1 or low, 2 or high.{{Dubious|date=June 2009}} This future potential has also been remarked by certain companies as [[Hypres]] which is actively engaged in ternary computing. IBM also reports infrequently on [[ternary computing]] topics (in its papers), but it is not actively engaged in it. The [[Josephson junction]] has been proposed as a balanced ternary memory cell, using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off. "The advantages of the proposed memory circuit are capability of high speed computation, low power consumption and very simple construction with less number of elements due to the ternary operation."<ref>{{doi|10.1109/ISMVL.1998.679270}}</ref> In 2009, a ternary [[quantum computer]] was proposed which thus uses [[qutrit]]s rather than [[qubit]]s. When the number of basic states of quantum element is ''d'', it is called [[qudit]]. <ref>[http://nextbigfuture.com/2009/08/qudits-multilevel-versions-of-qubits.html Qudits]</ref> ==Ternary computers in popular culture== In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', the sentient computers of Secundus, the planet on which part of the framing story is set, including Minerva, use an unbalanced ternary system. Minerva, in reporting a calculation result, says "three hundred forty one thousand six hundred forty... the original trinary readout is unit pair pair comma unit nil nil comma unit pair pair comma unit nil nil point nil" (Chapter ''Variations on a Theme III: Domestic Problems'', Berkley books 19th printing [1982] page 99) ==Literature== Hunger, Francis: SETUN.

It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an [[equilateral]] [[triangle]]. It is used in [[petrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[metallurgy]], and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. In [[population genetics]], it is often called a [[de Finetti diagram]]. In [[game theory]], it is often called a ''[[simplex]] plot''. [[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Example [[QFL triangle]] for [[sandstone]] [[provenance]]]] In a ternary plot, the proportions of the three variables ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' must sum to some constant, ''K''. Usually, this constant is represented as 1.0 or 100%. Because ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' = ''K'' for all substances being graphed, any one variable is not independent of the others, so only two variables must be known to find a sample's point on the graph: for instance, ''c'' must be equal to ''K'' &minus; ''a'' &minus; ''b''. Because the three proportions cannot vary independently, it is possible to graph the intersection of all three variables in only two dimensions. ==Reading values on the triangular plot== A ternary plot is drawn as a triangle. Each base, or side, of the triangle represents a proportion of 0%, with the point of the triangle opposite that base representing a proportion of 100%. As a proportion increases in any one sample, the point representing that sample moves from the base to the opposite point of the triangle. <gallery> image:ternary.example.1.jpg|An example ternary diagram, without any points plotted. image:ternary.example.axis.1.jpg|An example ternary diagram, showing increments along the first axis. image:ternary.example.axis.2.jpg|An example ternary diagram, showing increments along the second axis. image:ternary.example.axis.3.jpg|An example ternary diagram, showing increments along the third axis. image:Ternary plot 1.png|Empty diagram image:Ternary plot 2 (reverse axis).png|Empty diagram (alternative axis) </gallery> ==Using Cartesian coordinates == [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] are useful for plotting points in the triangle.
