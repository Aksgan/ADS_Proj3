achieving a level of speed and smoothness not previously seen on an affordable computer. The 1984 demo ran standalone as there was no official DOS operating system and Intuition was just a glint in [[Robert J. Mical|RJ Mical]]'s eye at the time. A year later this demo was converted to operate in an [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] Screen, allowing the higher resolution Amiga Workbench screen to be dragged down to make the Boing Ball visible from behind, bouncing up above the Workbench while the Workbench remained fully active. Since the Boing Ball used almost no CPU time (only to calculate the bounce angles - animation was handled by playfield vertical and horizontal scrolling tricks, the rotation animation was done with [[color cycling]] in the graphics chip, and of course the sound chip handled the sound), this made a particularly impressive demonstration of multitasking at the time. The Boing Ball itself was never officially adopted as a [[trademark]] by [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. The official Amiga trademark was a rainbow-colored double [[checkmark]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/originsboing.html|title=Dr. Ryan Czerwinski of Merlancia Industries explains the origin of the Amiga Boing ball and checkmark|author=Ryan Czerwinski|date=December 31, 2001|work=Amiga Network News| accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref> == Amiga community == When Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there was still a very active Amiga community, and it continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. Despite of declining interest in the platform there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine [[Micro Mart]]. There is also a web site, [http://www.amiga.org/index.php Amiga.org], that has served as a community discussion and support resource since the 1994 bankruptcy. == Notable historic uses == <!-- Do not add unreferenced material in this section.
