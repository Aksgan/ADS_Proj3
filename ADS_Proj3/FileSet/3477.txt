and rewritable. Capacities vary, from hundreds of megabytes (in the same ballpark as CDs) to tens of gigabytes (surpassing, at great expense, Blu-ray discs).<!--Blu-ray stores 50 GB; as of this writing, 64 GB flash drives are available but cost over $100 (2009-02-25)--> * [[Tape drive]] - a device that reads and writes data on a magnetic tape, used for long term storage and backups. ==Secondary storage== Hardware that keeps data inside the computer for later use and remains persistent even when the computer has no power. * [[Hard disk]] - for medium-term storage of data. * [[Solid-state drive]] - a device similar to hard disk, but containing no moving parts and stores data in a digital format. * [[Disk array controller|RAID array controller]] - a device to manage several internal or external hard disks and optionally some peripherals in order to achieve performance or reliability improvement in what is called a RAID array. ==Sound card== {{Main|Sound card}} Enables the computer to output sound to audio devices, as well as accept input from a [[microphone]]. Most modern computers have sound cards built-in to the motherboard, though it is common for a user to install a separate sound card as an upgrade. Most sound cards, either built-in or added, have surround sound capabilities. ==Input and output peripherals== {{Main|Peripheral}} [[Input device|Input]] and [[Output device|output]] devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems.

Possibly use text from the intro section of "Input device" --> * [[Character (computing)|Text]] input devices ** [[Keyboard (computing)|Keyboard]] - a device to input text and characters by depressing buttons (referred to as keys or buttons). * [[Pointing device]]s ** [[Mouse (computing)|Mouse]] - a pointing device that detects two dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. *** [[Optical Mouse]] - uses light to determine mouse motion. ** [[Trackball]] - a pointing device consisting of an exposed protruding ball housed in a socket that detects rotation about two axes. ** [[Touchscreen]] - senses the user pressing directly on the display * [[Computer and Video Games|Gaming]] devices ** [[Joystick]] - a control device that consists of a handheld stick that pivots around one end, to detect angles in two or three dimensions. ** [[Game pad]] - a hand held game controller that relies on the digits (especially thumbs) to provide input. ** [[Game controller]] - a specific type of controller specialized for certain gaming purposes. * [[Image]], [[Video]] input devices ** [[Image scanner]] - a device that provides input by analyzing images, printed text, handwriting, or an object. ** [[Web cam]] - a video camera used to provide visual input that can be easily transferred over the internet. * [[Sound recording and reproduction|Audio]] input devices ** [[Microphone]] - an acoustic sensor that provides input by converting sound into electrical signals. ===Output=== {{Main|Output device}} <!-- Add a short paragraph to define output devices. Possibly use text from the intro section of "Output device" --> *[[Printer (computing)|Printer]] - a device that produces a permanent human-readable text of graphic document. *[[Computer speaker|Speaker]]s - typically a pair of devices (2 channels) which convert electrical signals into audio. **[[Headphones]] - for a single user hearing the audio. *[[Computer monitor|Monitor]] - an electronic visual display with textual and graphical information from the computer. **[[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] - (Cathode Ray Tube) display **[[LCD]] - (Liquid Crystal Display) as of 2010, it is the primary visual display for personal computers. **[[LED]] - (light-emitting diode) display **[[OLED]] - Organic Light-Emitting Diode ==See also== *[[Glossary of computers]] {{Basic computer components}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Personal Computer Hardware}} [[Category:Personal computers]] [[Category:Computer hardware]] <!-- Removed GA status.

Persuasive writing involves convincing the reader to perform an action, or it may simply consist of an argument(s) convincing the reader of the writer’s point of view. Persuasive writing is one of the most used writing types in the world. Persuasive writers employ many techniques to improve their argument and show support for their claim. Another definition is "an essay that offers and supports an opinion". ==Early rhetoric and persuasive writing== Early rhetoricians dealt with persuasive writing and oration. [[Cicero]] most notably defined persuasive writing as the grand style in his work ''[[Orator]]''. Cicero stated, ''“This eloquence has power to sway man’s mind and move them in every possible way”''. He also stated, however, that the most effective orator, or in this case, writer, uses a combination of the plain, middle, and this grand style to suit the context. ==Ethos, logos, and pathos in persuasive writing== By appealing to credibility, writers can make their claims more believable. This is called an appeal to [[ethos]], as defined by Aristotle. The writer builds on his or her ethos by writing with clarity (an important element of style) and eliminating contradictions within the text itself. The writer will be more credible to the target audience if there are no internal errors in [[syntax]] and mechanics as well as no factual errors in the subject matter. Writers can
