It is [[Software prototyping#Throwaway prototyping|throwaway prototyping]] and involves creating rough, even hand-sketched, drawings of an interface to use as prototypes, or models, of a design. While paper prototyping seems simple, this method of [[usability testing]] can provide a great deal of useful feedback which will result in the design of better products. This is supported by many usability professionals.<sup id="nbFoot01a" class="reference">[[#noteFoot01|[2]]]</sup> == History == Paper prototyping started in the mid 1980s and then became popular in the mid 1990s when companies such as [[IBM]], [[Honeywell]], [[Microsoft]], and others started using the technique in developing their products. Today, paper prototyping is used widely in user centered design by usability professionals. More recently, [[digital paper prototyping]] has been advocated by companies like [[Pidoco]] due to advantages in terms of collaboration, flexibility and cost. == Benefits == Paper prototyping saves time and money since it enables developers to test product interfaces (from software and websites to cell phones and microwave ovens) before they write code or begin development. This also allows for easy and inexpensive modification to existing designs which makes this method useful in the early phases of design. Using paper prototyping allows the entire creative team to be involved in the process, which eliminates the chance of someone with key information not be involved in the design process. Another benefit of paper prototyping is that users feel more comfortable being critical of the mock up because it doesnâ€™t have a polished look<sup id="nbFoot01a" class="reference">[[#noteFoot01|[4]]]</sup>. There are different methods of paper prototyping, each of them showing several benefits regarding the communication within the development team and the quality of the product to be developed: In the development team paper prototypes can serve as a visual specification of the graphical user interface, and by this means assure the quality of a software. Prototyping forces a more complete design of the user interface to be captured. In team meetings they provide a communication base between the team members. Testing prototypes at an early stage in development helps to identify software usability problems even before any code is written. The costs and annoyances of later changes are reduced, the support burden is lowered, and the overall quality of the software or website is increased<sup id="nbFoot01a" class="reference">[[#noteFoot01|[5]]]</sup>. ==When to use paper prototypes== Paper prototypes should be considered when the following is true<sup id="nbFoot01a" class="reference">[[#noteFoot01|[1]]]</sup>: * When the tools the designer wants to use in creating a prototype are not available. * When the designer wants to make a sincere effort to allow all members of a team, including those with limited software skills, to take part in the design process. *When tests of a design lead to a great deal of drawings. == Creating paper prototypes == ===Parts to implement=== Paper prototypes usually cannot mirror the whole software or web site to be produced. It is necessary to limit the scope of the prototype by focus or width and depth. Limiting a prototype by focus means to either show the uncertain and difficult issues or the well-known and easily designed ones. Width and depth refer to the level of generality of the prototype: Should the prototype represent the whole design without providing any detailed function, or should certain issues be shown in detail? It is useful to concentrate on the general design rather than details, in early stages of the conceptual phase, to probe if the overall design meets the user's expectations. Specific details may be tested isolated from the general design later in the conceptual or implementation phases. ===How to create paper prototypes=== First, the designers should meet and discuss both who the users of the interface are as well as the tasks that the users would perform. Then, individual interface elements of a paper prototype are painted or printed on paper, cut out, and put onto another piece of paper which models the computer screen. The arrangement of the interface elements can then be changed quickly and without programming, labels can be renamed, and objects added, removed, or replaced by other input widgets. The sequence of dialogs or pages in a web site can be varied on the fly, which makes it easy to test multiple versions of an application's Interaction design. It is important to note that these prototypes should not be a work of art. They are intended to be a means for creating a rough copy very quickly and easily. Often functionality can simply be explained to the user - they don't always need to see the result of their actions. While coaching the user on how to use your interface is counterproductive, explanation of features that have not yet been implemented is encouraged. '''a. Allowing for Scrolling''' A common feature in computer programs that seems difficult to create using paper is scrolling. However, there is a simple solution: cut a hole in your main page to allow for moving content. Then cut a long strip of paper, and attach tabs to the top and bottom. Once you line your strip up with the hole, secure the strip by placing barriers on the back of your main page to guide the scrolling section. '''b. Functional Drop-Down Menus''' Drop-down menus can also seem like a challenge, but with a little creativity, they can be made. Cut out a piece of paper, and create the menu as you would like it to show up after being opened. Then, fold the menus like an accordion, such that the last fold exposes the back side of an option. On this face, you should write the name of the menu (as well as at the top of the menu, which will begin hidden). When someone "clicks" your drop-down menu, simply pull down the accordion. '''c. Slight Differences Between Pages''' If a button press or other action makes a very slight difference on a page, don't bother making a whole new prototype page. Rather, create a "flip-up" window. In the changing area, simply glue a folded piece of paper to the page, and draw
