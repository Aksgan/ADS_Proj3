It performs [[handwriting recognition]] and converts handwriting into text for use in most non-full-screen Windows applications. It was included first in [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] and is included in subsequent client versions of Microsoft Windows. ==Features== {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- |<!--column1-->[[Image:Tablet PC Input Panel handwriting.png|300px]] |<!--column2-->[[Image:Tablet PC Input Panel ocr.png|300px]] |- |<!--column1-->Tablet PC Input Panel Handwriting |<!--column2-->Tablet PC Input Panel Character Recognition |} * Users can use a writing pad or soft keyboard to convert handwriting to text. The writing pad recognises single characters, entire words and shortcut strokes or gestures. The Tablet PC Input Panel also supports AutoComplete in Windows Vista and later. * The Tablet PC Input Panel can be docked to the top or bottom of the screen or floating. * The integrated handwriting recognition features can recognize print, cursive, or mixed writing. Accuracy can be increased by configuring the recognizer to expect left-handed writing or right-handed writing. For Windows XP Tablet PC Edition which does not support all languages out of the box, recognition in a variety of languages is available with the install of a [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=080184dd-5e92-4464-b907-10762e9f918b&DisplayLang=en recognizer pack]. Windows Vista and Windows 7 users can get additional language support for handwriting recognition by installing the respective [[Multilingual User Interface|MUI]] pack (also called language pack). * The soft keyboard supports viewing the keyboard layout of the selected input language chosen from the language bar. Windows XP users need to install the Tablet PC Recognizer Pack to support switching of the soft keyboard to the default input language. <ref> [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/828729 Tablet PC Recognizer Pack frequently asked questions] </ref> * Handwriting recognition accuracy can be improved by training using the handwriting recognition personalization tool. * Windows 7 improves the Tablet PC Input Panel to make faster corrections, supports text prediction in the soft keyboard and introduces a new Math Input Panel for inputting math into programs that support [[MathML]]. It recognizes handwritten math expressions and formulas. [[Image:MathInputPanel win7.png|thumb|Math Input Panel in [[Windows 7]] editing the [[Quadratic Formula]].]] ==History== When first introduced, Tablet PC Input Panel was only included with the [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] of Windows XP and had limited application text entry support. [[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition which was incorporated into Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 brought improved the handwriting recognition and allowed the Tablet PC Input Panel to be used in almost every application. The Tablet PC Input Panel was also revised to extend speech recognition services (input and correction) to other applications. With the release of Windows Vista, the Tablet PC Input Panel is built into all editions of Windows Vista with the exception of Home Basic and Starter editions. The speech recognition features were moved into [[Windows Speech Recognition]]. ==See also== *[[Tablet PC]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{windows-stub}} {{Windows Components}} [[Category:Windows XP]] [[Category:Windows components]] [[Category:Tablet PC]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36775</id> <title>Tabulator</title> <text>{{Multiple issues | notability=November 2009 | primarysources=November 2009 }} {{Infobox software | developer = MIT CSAIL [http://dig.csail.mit.edu/ DIG] group | author = [[Tim Berners-Lee]] | latest release version = 0.8.7 | latest release date = November 24, 2008 | platform = [[Firefox]] | genre = [[Semantic Web]] | license = [[MIT License]] | website = http://www.w3.org/2005/ajar/tab }} ''Not to be confused with [[Tabulating machine]].''

TMRS is designed to give the missile maintenance or storage manager visibility of missile and component identification, inspection, [[Technical order|time-compliance technical order]] (TCTO), time change, serviceability and location data. It was developed in a windowed menu format for easy use and operation. The program allows users to track and maintain air-to-air and air-to-ground missile systems. This includes both All-Up-Rounds (AURS), unassembled components and their support equipment.
