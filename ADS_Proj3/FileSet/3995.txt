combination of capacitors is always limited by the smallest working voltage of an individual capacitor. ===Switches=== Two or more [[switch]]es in parallel form a [[Logical disjunction|logical OR]]; the circuit carries current if at least one switch is 'on'. See [[OR gate]]. ===Cells and batteries=== If the cells of a battery are connected in parallel, the battery voltage will be the same as the cell voltage but the current supplied by each cell will be a fraction of the total current. For example, if a battery contains four cells connected in parallel and delivers a current of 1 [[ampere]], the current supplied by each cell will be 0.25 ampere. Parallel-connected batteries were widely used to power the [[Vacuum tube|valve]] filaments in [[portable radio]]s but they are now rare. == Combining conductances == From [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] we can deduce the rules for combining conductances. For two conductances <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> in parallel the voltage across them is the same and from Kirchoff's Current Law the total current is : <math>I_{Eq} = I_1 + I_2.\ \,</math> Substituting Ohm's law for conductances gives : <math>G_{Eq} V = G_1 V + G_2 V\ \,</math> and the equivalent conductance will be, : <math>G_{Eq} = G_1 + G_2.\ \,</math> For two conductances <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> in series the current through them will be the same and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law tells us that the voltage across them is the sum of the voltages across each conductance, that is, : <math>V_{Eq} = V_1 + V_2.\ \,</math> Substituting Ohm's law for conductance then gives, : <math>\frac {I}{G_{Eq}} = \frac {I}{G_1} + \frac {I}{G_2}</math> which in turn gives the formula for the equivalent conductance, : <math>\frac {1}{G_{Eq}} = \frac {1}{G_1} + \frac {1}{G_2}.</math> This equation can be rearranged slightly, though this is a special case that will only rearrange like this for two components. : <math>G_{Eq} = \frac{G_1 G_2}{G_1+G_2}.</math> ==Applications== Series circuits were formerly used for lighting in [[electric multiple unit]] trains. For example, if the supply voltage was 600 volts there might be eight 70-volt bulbs in series (total 560 volts) plus a [[resistor]] to drop the remaining 40 volts. Series circuits for train lighting were superseded, first by [[motor-generator]]s, then by [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices. Series resistance can also be applied to the arrangement of blood vessels within a given organ. Each organ is supplied by a large artery, smaller arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins arranged in series. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, as expressed by the following equation: R<sub>total</sub> = R<sub>artery</sub> + R<sub>arterioles</sub> + R<sub>capillaries</sub>. The largest proportion of resistance in this series is contributed by the arterioles.<ref name="BRS">''Board Review Series: Physiology'' by Linda S. Costanzo pg. 74</ref> Parallel resistance is illustrated by the [[circulatory system]]. Each organ is supplied by an artery that branches off the [[aorta]]. The total resistance of this parallel arrangement is expressed by the following equation: 1/R<sub>total</sub> = 1/R<sub>a</sub> + 1/R<sub>b</sub> + ... 1/R<sub>n</sub>. R<sub>a</sub>, R<sub>b</sub>, and R<sub>n</sub> are the resistances of the renal, hepatic, and other arteries respectively. The total resistance is less than the resistance of any of the individual arteries.<ref name="BRS"/> == See also == *[[network analysis (electrical circuits)]] *[[Wheatstone bridge]] *[[Y-Δ transform]] *[[Voltage divider]] *[[Current divider]] *[[Electrical impedance#Combining impedances|Combining impedances]] *[[Equivalent impedance transforms]] ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==References== * Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), ''Physics'', Vol I and II, Combined edition, Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527 * Smith, R.J.

The most frequent use of SSI is to include the contents of one or more files into a web page on a [[web server]]. For example, a web page containing a daily quote could include the quote by placing the following code into the file of the web page: <source lang="xml"><!--#include virtual="../quote.txt" --></source> With one change of the <code>quote.txt</code> file, all pages including the file will display the latest daily quote. The inclusion is not limited to files. In this very example{{Clarify|reason=This example shows how to copy the text from some file and send it to the web browser. We need a separate example to illustrate running an executable file, and sending the output (not the file itself) to the web browser.|date=July 2010}}, on a server that can run [[Fortune (Unix)|fortune]], the output of it, a randomly selected quote, can also be included. Server Side Includes are useful for including a common piece of code throughout a site, such as a page header, a page footer and a navigation menu. Conditional navigation menus can be conditionally included using control directives. In order for a web server to recognize an SSI-enabled [[HTML]] file and therefore carry out these instructions, either the filename should end with a special [[Filename extension|extension]], by default <code>.shtml</code>, <code>.stm</code>, <code>.shtm</code>, or, if the server is configured to allow this, set the execution bit of the file. As a simple programming language, SSI supports only one [[Data type|type]]: text. Its [[control flow]] is rather simple, choice is supported, but loops are not natively supported and can only be done
