of Yunzi are also available in double-convex while synthetic stones can be either shape. Traditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white; this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal-sized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones.<ref name="EquipStones"/><ref group="nb">See [[Overshoot (typography)|Overshoot]] in Western typography for similar subtle adjustment to create a uniform appearance.</ref> [[Image:Bowls dwindsor.jpg|thumb|left|An example of single-convex stones and ''Go Seigen'' bowls. These particular stones are made of [[Yunzi]] material, and the bowls of jujube wood.]] ====Bowls==== The bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside.<ref name="EquipBowls">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 153–155</ref> The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game. Chinese bowls are slightly larger, and a little more rounded, a style known generally as ''Go Seigen''; Japanese ''Kitani'' bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a [[snifter]] glass, such as for [[brandy]]. The bowls are usually made of turned wood. [[Rosewood]] is the traditional material for Japanese bowls, but is very expensive; wood from the Chinese [[jujube]] date tree, which has a lighter color (it is often stained) and slightly more visible grain pattern, is a common substitute for rosewood, and traditional for Go Seigen-style bowls. Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include [[lacquer]]ed wood, [[ceramics]], stone and woven straw or [[rattan]]. The names of the bowl shapes, Go Seigen and Kitani, pay homage to two 20th-century professional Go players by the same names, of Chinese and Japanese nationality, respectively, who are referred to as the "Fathers of modern Go".<ref name="msoworld.com">{{Citation | first = John | last = Fairbairn | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/jowa.html | title = Jowa - Sage or Scoundrel | accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> ====Modern and low-cost alternatives==== In clubs and at tournaments, where large numbers of sets must be purchased and maintained by one organization, expensive traditional sets are not usually used. For these situations, table boards are usually used instead of floor boards, and are either made of a lower-cost wood such as spruce or bamboo, or are flexible mats made of [[vinyl]] that can be rolled up. In such cases, the stones are usually made of glass, plastic or resin (such as melamine or [[Bakelite]]) rather than slate and shell. Bowls are often made of plastic, sometimes of inexpensive wood. Common "novice" Go sets are all-inclusive kits made of particle board or [[plywood]], with plastic or glass stones, that either fold up to enclose the stone containers or have pull-out drawers to keep stones. In relative terms, these sets are inexpensive, costing US$20–$40 depending on component quality, and thus are popular with casual Go players. Magnetic sets are also available, either as portable travel sets or in larger sizes for educational purposes. ===Playing technique and etiquette=== [[Image:Playing weiqi in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A pair of [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] men demonstrate the traditional technique of holding a stone.]] The traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take one from the bowl, gripping it between the index and middle fingers, with the middle finger on top, and then placing it directly on the desired intersection.<ref name="style">{{Citation | publisher = [[Nihon Ki-in]] | url = http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/lesson/knowledge-e/uchikata-e.htm | title = A stylish way to play your stones | accessdate = 2007-02-24}}</ref> It is considered respectful towards one's opponent to place one's first stone in the upper right-hand corner.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayingTheFirstMoveInTheUpperRightCorner Sensei's Library: Playing the first move in the upper right corner]</ref> It is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal, thus producing a sharp clack. ===Time control=== {{see also|Time control|Byoyomi}} A game of Go may be timed using a [[game clock]]. Formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the 1920s and were controversial.<ref>Bozulich 2001 pp. 92–93</ref> Adjournments and [[sealed move]]s began to be regulated in the 1930s. Go tournaments use a number of different time control systems. All common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game, but they vary on the protocols for continuation (in ''overtime'') after a player has finished that time allowance.<ref group="nb">Roughly, one has the time to play the game and then a little time to finish it off. Time-wasting tactics are possible in Go, so that ''sudden death'' systems, in which time runs out at a predetermined point however many plays are in the game, are relatively unpopular (in the West).</ref> The most widely used time control system is the so called ''[[byoyomi]]''<ref group="nb">Literally in Japanese ''byōyomi'' means 'reading of seconds'.</ref> system. The top professional Go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks. Two widely used variants of the byoyomi system are:<ref name="Byoyomi">{{Citation | publisher = European Go Federation | url = http://www.eurogofed.org/egf/tourrules.htm | title = EGF General Tournament Rules | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> *''Standard byoyomi'': After the main time is depleted, a player has a certain number of time periods (typically around thirty seconds). After each move, the number of full time periods that the player took (possibly zero) is subtracted. For example, if a player has three thirty-second time periods and takes thirty or more (but less than sixty) seconds to make a move, they lose one time period. With 60–89 seconds, they lose two time periods, and so on. If, however, they take less than thirty seconds, the timer simply resets without subtracting any periods. Using up the last period means that the player has lost on time. *''Canadian byoyomi'': After using all of their main time, a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time, such as twenty moves within five minutes.<ref name="Byoyomi"/><ref group="nb">Typically, players stop the clock, and the player in overtime sets his/her clock for the desired interval, counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach, so as not to become confused. If twenty moves are made in
