Its purpose is to regulate the services provided by [[optician]]s and [[Optometry|optometrist]]s ([[ophthalmic optician]]s). The stated function of the GOC is "''to protect the public and promote high standards of professional conduct and education amongst opticians''". Opticians and optometrists must be registered with the GOC in order to continue to practise in the UK. It also maintains a register of companies who carry on business as opticians. The GOC can take action against opticians who are deemed "unfit to practise" and also against people or companies who break the terms of the Opticians Act. The GOC was in the news at the end of September to the start of October 2005 after bringing charges against [[eBay]] UK for "''‘aiding and abetting’ sales of contact lenses without the involvement of a qualified optician.''"{{Fact|date=April 2007}} ==See also== [[CHRE]] ==External links== *[http://www.optical.org/ Official website] *[http://www.optical.org/index_files/news_room/documents/2005-09-28GOCprosecuteseBay.pdf GOC press release - "General Optical Council prosecutes eBay for illegal contact lens sales"] *[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4292740.stm BBC News Online article regarding eBay charges] [[Category:British professional bodies]] [[Category:Vision]] [[Category:Optometry]] [[Category:National Health Service]] {{Medical regulation in the United Kingdom}} {{NHS-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14940</id> <title>General linear model</title> <text>{{distinguish|generalized linear model}} The ''general linear model'' (GLM) is a statistical [[linear model]].

The errors are usually assumed to follow a [[multivariate normal distribution]]. If the errors do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, [[generalized linear models]] may be used to relax assumptions about '''Y''' and '''U'''. The general linear model incorporates a number of different statistical models: [[ANOVA]], [[ANCOVA]], [[MANOVA]], [[MANCOVA]], ordinary [[linear regression]], [[t-test]] and [[F-test]]. If there is only one column in '''Y''' (i.e., one dependent variable) then the model can also be referred to as the [[multiple regression]] model (multiple linear regression). Hypothesis tests with the general linear model can be made in two ways: [[multivariate]] or as several independent [[univariate]] tests. In multivariate tests the columns of '''Y''' are tested together, whereas in univariate tests the columns of '''Y''' are tested independently, i.e., as multiple univariate tests with the same design matrix. == Applications == An application of the general linear model appears in the analysis of multiple [[brain scan]]s in scientific experiments where '''Y''' contains data from brain scanners, '''X''' contains experimental design variables and confounds. It is usually tested in a univariate way (usually referred to a ''mass-univariate'' in this setting) and is often referred to as [[statistical parametric mapping]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.460020402 | author = K.J.
