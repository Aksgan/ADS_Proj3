is known as the [[sidereal month]]. However, during one sidereal month, the Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. This is known as the [[synodic month]], and corresponds to what is commonly called the [[lunar month]]. [[Image:Solar eclipse types.svg|left|thumb|'''A''' Total eclipse in the umbra.<br/>'''B''' Annular eclipse in the antumbra. <br/>'''C''' Partial eclipse in the penumbra]] The Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its [[ascending node]], and vice versa at its descending node. However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a [[retrograde motion]], due to the action of the Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the [[draconic month]]. Finally, the Moon's perigee is moving forwards in its orbit, and makes a complete circuit in about 9 years. The time between one perigee and the next is known as the [[anomalistic month]]. The Moon's orbit intersects with the ecliptic at the two nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months apart, and there will always be at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months. This means that in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five. However, some are visible only as partial eclipses, because the umbra passes above Earth's north or south pole, and others are central only in remote regions of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctic]].<ref>{{Cite book|first=F.|last= Espenak |title=Fifty Year Canon of Solar Eclipses: 1986–2035 |publisher=NASA RP-1178 |year= 1987 |location=Greenbelt, MD|isbn=093334645X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first=J.|last= Meeus|coauthors= C.

The Earth is also rotating from west to east, but the umbra always moves faster than any given point on the Earth's surface, so it almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth (there are some rare exceptions to this which can occur during an eclipse of the [[midnight sun]] in Arctic or Antarctic regions, for example on [[Solar eclipse of June 10, 2021|June 10]] and [[Solar eclipse of December 4, 2021|December 4]], 2021). The width of the track of a central eclipse varies according to the relative apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon. In the most favourable circumstances, when a total eclipse occurs very close to perigee, the track can be over 250 km wide and the duration of totality may be over 7 minutes. Outside of the central track, a partial eclipse can usually be seen over a much larger area of the Earth.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Eclipse |publisher=MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568140/Eclipse.html}}</ref> ==Occurrence and cycles== [[Image:Total Solar Eclipse Paths- 1001-2000.gif|thumb|300px|Total Solar Eclipse Paths: 1001–2000.

Espenak |title=World Atlas of Solar Eclipse Paths |url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEatlas/SEatlas.html}}</ref>]] Total solar eclipses are rare events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average,<ref>{{Cite web|title=NASA Eclipse Home Page |publisher=NASA |url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/eclipse.html }}</ref> it has been estimated that they recur at any given place only once every 370 years, on average. The total eclipse only lasts for a few minutes at that location, as the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700 km/h. Totality can never last more than 7 min 31 s, and is usually much shorter: during each [[millennium]] there are typically fewer than 10 total solar eclipses exceeding 7 minutes. The last time this happened was [[Solar eclipse of June 30, 1973|June 30, 1973]] (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a [[Concorde]] aircraft were able to stretch totality to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until [[Solar eclipse of June 25, 2150|June 25, 2150]]. The longest total solar eclipse during the 8,000-year period from 3000 BC to 5000 AD will occur on [[Solar eclipse of July 16, 2186|July 16, 2186]], when totality will last 7 min 29 s.<ref>{{Cite book|first=F.R.|last= Stephenson |title=Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year= 1997 |page=54|isbn=0521461944}}</ref> For comparison, the longest eclipse of the 21st century occurred on [[Solar eclipse of 22 July 2009|July 22, 2009]] and lasted 6 min 39 sec. If the date and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is possible to predict other eclipses using [[eclipse cycle]]s. Two such cycles are the [[Saros cycle|Saros]] and the [[Inex]]. The Saros cycle is probably the best known and one of the most accurate eclipse cycles. The Inex cycle is itself a poor cycle, but it is very convenient in the classification of eclipse cycles. After a Saros cycle finishes, a new Saros cycle begins one Inex later, hence its name: in-ex. A Saros cycle lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that after this period a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a shift of 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude. A Saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends at the opposite polar region. A Saros (series) lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 central.<ref>{{Cite web|author=F.
