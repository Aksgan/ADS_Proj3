put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen and countrywomen. John Adams, writing to [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1776, agreed with some [[Classical antiquity|classical]] Greek and Roman thinkers in that "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics." He continued: <blockquote> "There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public Passion must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they must pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures, Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society."<ref name=Rahe1994>Adams quoted in Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution. Volume: 2'' (1994) P. 23.</ref> </blockquote> For women, "[[republican motherhood]]" became the ideal, exemplified by [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]]; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation. Thomas Paine's best-seller pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence, by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.<ref>Ferguson, ''The Commonalities of Common Sense'' (2000) pp. 465–504</ref> [[Dissenter|Dissenting]] (i.e. Protestant, non-[[Church of England]]) churches of the day were the "school of democracy”<ref name=Bonomi>Bonomi, p. 186, Chapter 7 “Religion and the American Revolution</ref> President [[John Witherspoon]] of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Hebrew Bible.

For the British, policy makers saw these laws as necessary to rein in colonial subjects who, in the name of economic development that was designed to benefit the home nation, had been allowed near-autonomy for too long. ====1733–1763: Navigation Acts, Molasses Act and Royal Proclamation==== [[Image:Map of territorial growth 1775.svg|thumb|alt=Eastern North America in 1775.

That is, American merchants were not allowed to trade with the French, Dutch or Spanish empires. Britain implemented mercantilism through the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, "Then and there the child Independence was born."<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref> In 1762, Patrick Henry argued the [[Parson's Cause]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where the legislature had passed a law and it was vetoed by the king.
