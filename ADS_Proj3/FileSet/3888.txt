Instead of addressing the target host directly they must address the SOCKS proxy and ask it to connect to the target host.

It is a powerful program that is used in [[integrated circuit]] and board-level design to check the integrity of [[circuit design]]s and to predict [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] behavior. == Introduction == Integrated circuits, unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts, are impossible to [[breadboard]] before manufacture. Further, the high costs of [[Photomask|photolithographic masks]] and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built.
