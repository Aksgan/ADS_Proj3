With application service automation operations teams can transform manual, error-prone application service tasks into reliable, repeatable and timely processes to gain control over application packaging, deployment, change, troubleshooting, recovery and auditing. Application service automation enables the simple modeling of application workflows, including tiers and dependencies and executes these across any heterogeneous data center environment - physical, virtual and cloud. By simplifying operational complexity and eliminating application configuration errors Application Service Automation enables heightened uptime while reducing the time and cost of servicing applications. Automated application deployment is considered a subset of application service automation. ==References== <!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.jumpsoft.net/ JumpCenter Automation Platform] * [http://www.noliosoft.com/ Nolio Automation Center] * [http://www.xebialabs.com/deployit-automated-deployment-java-applications XebiaLabs Deployit] * [http://documents.bmc.com/products/documents/10/45/91045/91045.pdf BMC Service Automation] * [https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&cp=1-11-271-273%5E14730_4000_100__ HP Service Automation] ==See also== * [[Application service management]] * [[Application performance management]] * [[System administration]] <!--- Categories ---> {{DEFAULTSORT:Application Service Automation}} [[Category:System administration]] [[Category:Performance management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2254</id> <title>Apricot Portable</title> <text>[[Image:Apricot portable.png|thumb|300px|Apricot Portable]] '''Apricot Portable''' was [[Apricot Computers]]' attempt at a [[portable computer]], first released in 1984. It had a 3.5" [[floppy drive]], 4.77 MHz CPU and 256 KiB [[RAM]]. It was the first computer to use an 80-column/25-line [[LCD]] and [[speech recognition]] for input/output. The speech recognition software held 4096 words, with only 64 available at a given time. It was also unique in the way that it had an infrared link between it and the keyboard; this was relatively new at the time. However, if an object blocked the infrared beam, communications would be cut off. The Apricot also featured a somewhat [[Macintosh|Mac]]-like graphical interface. It was originally priced at £1965. ==External links== *[http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=492 ACT Apricot Portable at the OLD-COMPUTERS.COM Museum] {{Compu-hardware-stub}} [[Category:Apricot Computers]] [[es:Apricot Portable]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2258</id> <title>Aptosid</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=July 2010}} {{lowercase}} {{Refimprove|date=April 2010}} {{Infobox OS | name = aptosid | logo = [[Image:sidux logo fred.svg|150px]] <!--| screenshot = [[Image:Sidux-2010-01.png|300px]] | caption = Screenshot of sidux 2010-01 („Ύπνος“), showing the desktop--> | website = [http://aptosid.com/ aptosid.com] | developer = aptosid-team around Stefan Lippers-Hollmann (slh) | family = [[Unix-like]] | source_model = [[Free and open source software]] | released = {{Start date|df=yes|2006|11|24}} | frequently_updated = yes | language = multilingual | latest_release_version = ([[Rolling release]]) | latest_release_date = Installation CD aptosid 2010-03 Apate "Ἀπάτη" <ref name='current release'>{{Cite web| url = http://aptosid.com/index.php?module=news&func=display&sid=17 | title = Release Notes: aptosid 2010-03}}</ref> | kernel_type = [[Monolithic kernel|Monolithic]] ([[Linux kernel|Linux]]) | userland = [[GNU Core Utilities|GNU]] | supported_platforms = [[x86]], [[amd64]] | ui = [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|KDE Plasma Desktop]] or [[Xfce]] and [[Fluxbox]] available by default | updatemodel = [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] (front-ends available) | package_manager = [[dpkg]] (front-ends available) | license = [[GNU General Public License]] and others. | working_state = Active (Replaces sidux See http://sidux.com/) }} '''aptosid''' is a desktop-oriented [[operating system]] based on the "unstable" branch of [[Debian]], which uses the codename ''Sid''. It was known as '''sidux''' until September 2010. The distribution consists of a [[Live CD]] (bootable CD-ROM) for the [[x86]] architecture installable to a hard drive through a graphical installer. The goal of the distribution is to provide a stable, easy-to-use and cutting-edge [[Free and open source software|free and open source]] operating system.<ref name='linux.com 2008 article'>{{Cite web| url = http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/149400 | title = Sidux grows on you | accessdate = 2010-05-27 | last = Linton | first = Susan | date = 2008-10-08 | publisher = [[Linux.com]] | quote = The developers strive for an easy-to-install and easy-to-use modern Debian derivative}}</ref><ref name='sidux wiki intro'>{{Cite web| url = http://sidux.com/index.php?module=Wikula&tag=welcome | title = Welcome to the sidux wiki | accessdate = 2010-05-27 | date = 2006-12-09 | publisher = [http://sidux.com sidux.com] | quote = We love Debian sid (aka "unstable") and believe in its innovative power.}}</ref> sidux was maintained by a team of developers including former [[Kanotix]] developer Stefan Lippers-Hollmann (slh). Initial administration was managed by ''The sidux Foundation, Inc.'' located in the [[United States]]. The Berlin, Germany based non-profit organization [http://sidux-ev.de ''sidux e.V.''] was administering and supporting the project. Due to disagreement between sidux e.V. and the sidux developers, all development of sidux has been halted in summer 2010 until September 2010. The entire project has been renamed as '''aptosid''', announced on 2010-09-11. aptosid is a direct upgrade from sidux. The first time a user runs an apt-get dist-upgrade in sidux, they are asked if they want their repositories changed to the new aptosid site and the system will be seamlessly upgraded to aptosid. ==Features== aptosid and sidux are based on Debian's most modern branch, sid. They include a manual<ref name='sidux manual'>{{Cite web| url = http://manual.aptosid.com/ | title = The aptosid Operating System Manual | accessdate = 2010-11-14 | publisher = [http://manual.aptosid.com aptosid.com]}}</ref> and a collection of tools and scripts to make desktop administration easier. One of aptosid's and sidux's more notable features, unlike most other Linux distributions, they utilize a true [[Rolling release|'rolling-release-cycle']], and thus continue to remain current. Users can update all of the system's packages via the command 'apt-get dist-upgrade'. Through this model, there should not, in theory, ever be a need to overwrite a aptosid or sidux system by installing an entirely new version. Other Linux distributions that use the rolling release model include [[Arch Linux]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]. ===Live CD - DVD - USB=== Each release comes as a [[Live CD]] or [[Live DVD]], booting to a graphical desktop without installation. On the Live CD a USB installer is provided to create a [[Live USB]] system, but the [[Live USB]] can be created easily from the [[Live CD]] ISO file.<ref name='liveusb'>{{Cite web| title = How to make a Live USB from the Live CD ISO file | date = 2010-05-25 | url
