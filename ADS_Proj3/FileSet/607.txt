Specialist|title=Encapsulation and Carpet Cleaning (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2002-10-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref> Encapsulation also avoids the drying time of carpet shampoos, making the carpet immediately available for use.<ref name=dry/> The use of encapsulation to create a crystalline residue that can be immediately vacuumed (as opposed to the dry powder residue of [[wet cleaning]] systems, which generally requires an additional day before vacuuming) has recently become an accepted method for commercial and residential carpet maintenance.<ref name=ics2/> ===Bonnet=== After [[club soda]] mixed with cleaning product is deposited onto the surface as mist, a round buffer or "bonnet" scrubs the mixture with rotating motion. This industry machine resembles a floor buffer, with an absorbent spin pad that attracts soil and is rinsed or replaced repeatedly. The bonnet method is not strictly dry-cleaning and involves significant drying time, and usually only addresses the top third of carpet, making it a quick solution rather than a deep cleaning of dirt or odor as considered suitable for valuable carpet.<ref name=dry/> To reduce pile distortion, the absorbent pad should be kept well-lubricated with cleaning solution. When there is a large amount of foreign material below the carpet backing, extraction with a wet process may be needed. The spin-bonnet method may not be as capable of sanitizing carpet fibers due to the lack of hot water, but a post-cleaning application of an antimicrobial agent is used to make up for this. Compared to steam cleaning, the small amounts of water required with spin-bonnet carpet cleaning favor water-conservation considerations. ==Wet-cleaning== Wet-cleaning systems naturally require drying time, which has led to customer fears and concerns about very slow drying, the risk of discoloration returning during drying, and odors, bacteria, fungi, molds, and mildews. Balancing the need for rapid drying (attributable to lower flow rate through the cleaning jets of a spray system) and the need to remove the most soil (attributable to higher flow rate) is a key technique that must be mastered by carpet-cleaning technicians.<ref name=ics3/> Pretreatments similar to those in dry-cleaning and "very low moisture" systems are employed, but require a longer dwell time of 15 to 20 minutes, because of lower amounts of carpet agitation. Ideal pretreatments should rinse easily and leave dry, powdery, or crystalline residue that can be flushed without contributing to resoiling.<ref name=ics4>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7741213_ITM|title=Pre- and Post-Cleaning Carpet Treatments: As you meander down the aisles of your supplier's showroom, you are presented with a wide array of products designed for such specialized purposes as spot removal, odor control or correction, color correction, and sanitizing (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref> ===Steam cleaning=== [[File:Carpet Cleaning Machine Rug Doctor.jpg|thumb|right|A carpet cleaning machine.]] {{details|Hot water extraction}} In high-pressure [[hot water extraction]] ("[[steam cleaning]]"),<ref name=ics5/> after preconditioning with an [[alkalinity|alkaline]] agent, agitation with a grooming [[brush]], and appropriate dwell time, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (such as a wand) passes over the surface several times to thoroughly rinse out all preconditioner, residue, and particulates, and, using an [[acetic acid]] solution, to restore neutral fiber [[pH scale|pH]]. The acid rinse thus neutralizes the alkaline residues, and can contribute to softening cleaned fabrics.<ref name=ics4/> Rather than soaps, the steam-cleaning system uses detergent-based solutions that dry to a powder or crystal.<ref name=ics2/> The surface is dried to avoid saturation, typically taking 3â€“4 hours if done correctly; inexperienced carpet-cleaning companies sometimes overwet carpeting, leading to [[mold]] and recurring [[stain]]s (arising from the "wicking" effect, whereby deeper soils are water-driven upward along carpet fibers, thus reconstituting visible stains). Some carpet-cleaning solutions are [[carbonation|carbonated]] to dissolve organic material more effectively. Beyond these treatments, antistaining and antisoiling products can be applied by the carpet owner, and have for this reason become recognized in the carpet-cleaning industry as some of its biggest profit centers.<ref name=ics4/> Extraction is by far the most important step in this process. Since the hot-water extraction method uses much more water than other methods like bonnet or shampoo cleaning, proper extraction is critical to avoid oversaturation. When carpet is saturated, there is a risk that soils and residue from deep in the carpet fiber and backing will "wick" up to the surface, resulting in browning, or the carpet layers may delaminate. Hot-water extraction generally involves slower drying times, lower production rates, and more labor-intensive processes than dry carpet cleaning.<ref name=ics5/> Drying time may also be decreased by extra use of fans, air conditioning, and/or outdoor ventilation.<ref name=ics3/> Older surfaces, such as double jute-backed carpets and loose rugs with natural foundation yarns, could shrink after a wet treatment, leading to suppositions that wet-cleaning could also remove wrinkles. However, this notion is antiquated and this method could also occasionally tear seams or uproot strips. Newer carpets, such as with synthetic backing and foundation yarns, do not shrink, and they smooth easily; in such carpets, wrinkles indicate an underlying problem, such as adhesive, that may need a certified carpet inspector to determine.<ref name=ics2/> ===Shampoo=== Wet shampoo cleaning with rotary machines, followed by thorough wet vacuuming, was widespread until about the 1970s, but industry perception of shampoo cleaning changed with the advent of encapsulation.<ref name=ics/> Hot-water extraction, also regarded as preferable, had not been introduced either. Wet shampoos were once formulated from [[coconut oil]] soaps;<ref name=ics2/> wet shampoo residues can be foamy or sticky, and steam cleaning often reveals dirt unextracted by shampoos.<ref name=ics/> Since no rinse is performed, the powerful residue can continue to collect dirt after cleaning, leading to the misconception that carpet cleaning can lead to the carpet getting "dirtier faster" after the cleaning.<ref name=sm/><ref name=ics2/> When wet-shampoo chemistry standards converted from coconut oil soaps to synthetic detergents as a base, the shampoos dried to a powder, and loosened dirt would attach to the powder components, requiring vacuuming by the consumer the day after cleaning.<ref name=ics2/> ==Household processes== Other household carpet-cleaning processes are much older than industry standardization, and have varying degrees of effectiveness as supplements to the more thorough cleaning methods accepted in the industry. ===Vacuum=== {{details|Vacuum cleaner}} [[Vacuum cleaner]]s use air [[pump]]s to create partial [[vacuum]]s to [[suction|suck]]
