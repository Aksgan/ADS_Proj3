properly reflect the input, and indeed may not correspond to either a logically high or low voltage. ==Logic voltage levels== [[Image:Hobby frequency counter.jpg|thumb|220px|Hobbyist frequency counter circuit built almost entirely of TTL logic chips.]] {{main|logic level}} The two states of a wire are usually represented by some measurement of an electrical property: [[Electric potential|Voltage]] is the most common, but [[Electric current|current]] is used in some logic families. A threshold is designed for each logic family. When below that threshold, the wire is "low," when above "high." Digital circuits establish a "no man's area" or "exclusion zone" that is wider than the tolerances of the components. The circuits avoid that area, in order to avoid indeterminate results. It is usual to allow some tolerance in the voltage levels used; for example, 0 to 2 volts might represent logic 0, and 3 to 5 volts logic 1. A voltage of 2 to 3 volts would be invalid, and occur only in a fault condition or during a logic level transition. However, few logic circuits can detect such a condition and most devices will interpret the signal simply as high or low in an undefined or device-specific manner. Some logic devices incorporate [[schmitt trigger]] inputs whose behaviour is much better defined in the threshold region, and have increased resilience to small variations in the input voltage. The levels represent the binary integers or logic levels of 0 and 1. In active-high logic, "low" represents binary 0 and "high" represents binary 1. Active-low logic uses the reverse representation. {| class="wikitable" |+ Examples of binary logic levels: !Technology !! L voltage !! H voltage !!

Digital signal processing and [[analog signal processing]] are subfields of [[signal processing]]. DSP includes subfields like: [[audio signal processing|audio]] and [[speech signal processing]], sonar and radar signal processing, sensor array processing, spectral estimation, statistical signal processing, [[digital image processing]], signal processing for communications, control of systems, biomedical signal processing, seismic data processing, etc. The goal of DSP is usually to measure, filter and/or compress continuous real-world analog signals. The first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form, by ''sampling'' it using an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC), which turns the analog signal into a stream of numbers. However, often, the required output signal is another analog output signal, which requires a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC). Even if this process is more complex than analog processing and has a [[discrete signal|discrete value range]], the application of computational power to digital signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as [[error detection|error detection and correction]] in transmission as well as [[data compression]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Digital Signal Processing: Instant access | author = James D.

Today there are additional technologies used for digital signal processing including more powerful general purpose [[microprocessor]]s, [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs), [[Digital Signal Controller|digital signal controllers]] (mostly for industrial apps such as motor control), and [[stream processing|stream processors]], among others.<ref>{{cite book | title = Digital Signal Processing and Applications | author = Dag Stranneby and William Walker | edition = 2nd ed. | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2004 | isbn = 0750663448 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NKK1DdqcDVUC&pg=PA241&dq=called+digital+signal+processor+hardware+application-specific+integrated+circuit+general-purpose+microprocessors+field-programmable+gate+arrays+dsp+asic+fpga+stream&as_brr=3&ei=cA0mSLWwB4qIswOEvsC5DQ&sig=EwJs3lv92Kai7Xw0i2XG9UpBVuA }}</ref> == DSP domains == In DSP, engineers usually study digital signals in one of the following domains: [[time domain]] (one-dimensional signals), spatial domain (multidimensional signals), [[frequency domain]], [[autocorrelation]] domain, and [[wavelet]] domains. They choose the domain in which to process a signal by making an informed guess (or by trying different possibilities) as to which domain best represents the essential characteristics of the signal. A sequence of samples from a measuring device produces a time or spatial domain representation, whereas a [[discrete Fourier transform]] produces the frequency domain information, that is the [[frequency spectrum]]. Autocorrelation is defined as the [[cross-correlation]] of the signal with itself over varying intervals of time or space. == Signal sampling == {{Main|Sampling (signal processing)}} With the increasing use of [[computer]]s the usage of and need for digital signal processing has increased. In order to use an analog signal on a computer it must be digitized with an analog-to-digital converter. Sampling is usually carried out in two stages, [[discretization]] and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. In the discretization stage, the space of signals is partitioned into [[equivalence class]]es and quantization is carried out by replacing the signal with representative signal of the corresponding equivalence class. In the quantization stage the representative signal values are approximated by values from a finite set. The [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] states that a signal can be exactly reconstructed from its samples if the [[sampling frequency]] is greater than twice the highest frequency of the signal; but requires an infinite number of samples . In practice, the sampling frequency is often significantly more than twice that required by the signal's limited bandwidth. A digital-to-analog converter is used to convert the digital signal back to analog. The use of a digital
