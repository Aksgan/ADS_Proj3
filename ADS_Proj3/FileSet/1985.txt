totally determined by the societal environment (see below). Further critics, learning from the broadly-defined [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] tradition, criticize the ''Homo economicus'' model as ignoring the inner conflicts that real-world individuals suffer, as between short-term and long-term goals (''e.g.,'' eating chocolate cake and losing weight) or between individual goals and societal values. Such conflicts may lead to "irrational" behavior involving inconsistency, psychological paralysis, neurosis, and/or psychic pain. Further irrational human behaviour can occur as a result of habit, laziness, mimicry and simple obedience. Although studying economics tends to make graduates slightly ''less'' like Homo economicus (e.g. having a lower defection rate in [[Prisoner's dilemma]] experiments)<ref> {{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=Robert |last2=Gilovich |first2=H.T. |last3= Regan |first2=D.T. |year= 1993 |month= |title= Does Studying Economics Inhibit Cooperation? |journal= Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume= 7 |issue= 2 |pages= 159–171 |url= http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/economics_frank/frank.html |accessdate= 2010-05-22 |quote= for students in general there is a pronounced tendency toward more cooperative behavior with movement toward graduation, a trend that is conspicuously absent for economics majors. }} </ref> this evolution is slower than for students of other disciplines. == Responses == {{Unreferenced|date=December 2008}} Economists tend to disagree with these critiques, arguing that it may be relevant to analyze the consequences of enlightened [[Rational egoism|egoism]] just as it may be worthwhile to consider altruistic or social behavior. Others argue that we need to understand the consequences of such narrow-minded greed even if only a small percentage of the population embraces such motives. [[Free rider problem|Free riders]], for example, would have a major negative impact on the provision of [[public good]]s. However, economists' supply and demand predictions might obtain even if only a significant minority of market participants act like ''Homo economicus''. In this view, the assumption of ''Homo economicus'' can and should be simply a preliminary step on the road to a more sophisticated model. Yet others argue that ''Homo economicus'' is a reasonable approximation for behavior within market institutions, since the individualized nature of human action in such social settings encourages individualistic behavior. Not only do market settings encourage the application of a simple cost/benefit calculus by individuals, but they reward and thus attract the more individualistic people. It can be difficult to apply social values (as opposed to following self-interest) in an extremely competitive market; a company that refuses to pollute (for example) may find itself bankrupt. Defenders of the ''Homo economicus'' model see many critics of the dominant school as using a [[straw man]] technique. For example, it is common for critics to argue that real people do not have cost-less access to infinite information and an innate ability to instantly process it. However, in advanced-level theoretical economics, scholars have found ways of addressing these problems, modifying models enough to more realistically depict real-life decision-making. For example, models of individual behavior under [[bounded rationality]] and of people suffering from [[envy]] can be found in the literature. It is primarily when targeting the limiting assumptions made in constructing undergraduate models that the criticisms listed above are valid. These criticisms are especially valid to the extent that the professor asserts that the simplifying assumptions are true and/or uses them in a propagandistic way. The more sophisticated economists are quite conscious of the empirical limitations of the ''Homo economicus'' model. In theory, the views of the critics can be combined with the ''Homo economicus'' model to attain a more accurate model. ==Homo sociologicus== Comparisons between economics and sociology have resulted in a corresponding term '''Homo sociologicus''' (introduced by German Sociologist [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] in 1958), to parody the image of human nature given in some sociological models that attempt to limit the social forces that determine individual tastes and social values. (The alternative or additional source of these would be [[biology]].) Hirsch ''et al.'' say that ''Homo sociologicus'' is largely a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' upon which societies and cultures write values and goals; unlike ''economicus,'' ''sociologicus'' acts not to pursue selfish interests but to fulfill social roles<ref>Hirsch, Paul, Stuart Michaels and Ray Friedman. 1990.
