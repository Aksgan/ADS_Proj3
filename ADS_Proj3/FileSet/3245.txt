to an agreement in 1940 to provide MAGIC on alternating days, and try to draw up some vague guidelines for which team handled what traffic. Complicating matters was that the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and even the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] also had radio-intercept operations. The result was that much of the MAGIC was wasted. There was no efficient process for assessing and organizing the intelligence, or getting it to its proper end users. This was a dangerous problem as the time was rapidly approaching when that data would be a matter of life and death. ==Attack on Pearl Harbor== In the dark hours of the morning of 7 December 1941, the [[U.S. Navy]] communications intercept station at [[Fort Ward (Washington)|Fort Ward]] on [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]], picked up a radio message being sent by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] government to the Japanese embassy in [[Washington DC]]. It was the last in a series of 14 messages that had been sent over the previous 18 hours. The messages were decrypted by a [[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE]] analogue machine at OP-20-G and passed to the SIS for translation from Japanese, early on the morning of [[December 7]]. Army Colonel [[Rufus S. Bratton]] and Navy Lieutenant Commander [[Alvin Kramer]] independently inspected the decrypts. They both became alarmed. The decrypts instructed the Japanese ambassador to Washington to inform the US Secretary of State, [[Cordell Hull]], at 1:00 PM Washington time that negotiations between the [[US]] and [[Japan]] were ended. The embassy was then to destroy their [[cipher]] machines. This sounded like war, and although the message said nothing about any specific military action, Kramer also realized that the sun would be rising over the expanses of the central and western Pacific by that time. The two men both tried to get in touch with Army Chief of Staff General [[George C. Marshall]]. After some agonizing delays, Marshall got the decrypts and methodically examined them. He realized their importance and sent a warning to field commanders, including Major General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii. However, Marshall was reluctant to use the telephone because he knew that telephone scramblers weren't very secure and sent it by less direct channels. Due to various constraints and bumblings, Short got the message many hours after the Japanese bombs had smashed the [[US Navy]]'s fleet at anchor in [[Pearl Harbor]]. ==After Pearl Harbor== As [[Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)|Japanese advances in the Philippines]], the possibility of an invasion of Hawaii, and the increasing demand for intelligence, OP-20-G undertook two courses of action: *the staff and services of <small>CAST</small> were progressively transferred to a newly-formed US-[[Australia]]n-British station, <small>[[FRUMEL]]</small> in [[Melbourne]], Australia.<ref name="ibiblio.net">[http://www.ibiblio.net/hyperwar////PTO/Magic/COMINT-CoralSea/PartOne.html Parker, Frederick D.

The specifications provides for access to raw, [[interpolated]] and [[aggregate data]] (data with calculations). OPC Historical Data Access, also known as OPC HDA, is used to exchange archived process data. This is in contrast to the [[OPC Data Access]] (OPC DA) specification that deals with real-time data. OPC technology is based on client / server architecture. Therefore, an OPC client, such as a trending application or spreadsheet, can retrieve data from an OPC compliant data source, such as a historian, using OPC HDA. Similar to the [[OPC Data Access]] specification, OPC Historical Data Access also uses Microsoft's [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] to transport data. [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] also provides OPC HDA with full security features such as user authentication and authorization, as well as communication encryption services. OPC HDA Clients and Servers can reside on separate PCs, even if they are separated by a firewall. To do this, system integrators must configure DCOM properly as well as open ports in the firewall. If using the Windows firewall, users only need to open a single port. ==See also== *[[OLE for process control]] *[[OPC Foundation]] *[[OPC Data Access]] ==External links== *[http://www.opcfoundation.org OPC Foundation] {{standard-stub}} [[Category:Automation]] [[Category:Computer and telecommunication standards]] [[Category:Consortia]] [[Category:Microsoft application programming interfaces]] [[Category:Software components]] [[pl:OPC Historical Data Access]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26920</id> <title>OPIE user interface</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = Open Palmtop Integrated Environment | logo = | screenshot = [[Image:opie 1 2 launcher.png]] | caption = | author = | developer = Opie Team | released = | latest release version = 1.2.5 | latest release date = 12
