polyester mat, seams sealed by locally melting the asphalt with heat, hot mopping of asphalt, or adhesive. Lends itself well to most applications. ** Built-Up Roof - Multiple plies of salt saturated organic felt or coated fiberglass felts. Plies of felt are adhered with hot asphalt, coal tar pitch or adhesive. Although the roof membrane can be left bare, it is typically covered with a thick coat of the water-proofing material and covered with gravel. The gravel provides protection from ultra-violet degradation, stabilizes the temperature changes, protects surface of the roof and increases the weight of the roof system to resist wind blow-off. ** [[Textile|Fabric]] [[Image:Eastern michigan University indoor practice field with polyester roof.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Eastern Michigan University|Eastern Michigan U.]] indoor practice facility with air-supported [[polyester]] roof]] *** [[polyester]]. *** [[PTFE]], (synthetic fluoropolymer) embedded in [[fibreglass]]. * [[Metal roof]]ing.

The term ''rootkit'' is a [[concatenation]] of [[Superuser|"root"]] (the traditional name of the privileged account on [[Unix]] operating systems) and the word "kit" (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term "rootkit" has negative connotations through its association with malware.<ref name="McAfee1"/> Typically, an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] installs a rootkit on a computer after first obtaining root-level access, either by exploiting a known vulnerability or by obtaining a password (either by [[Password cracking|cracking]] the encryption, or through [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]]). Once a rootkit is installed, it allows an attacker to mask the ongoing intrusion and maintain privileged access to the computer by circumventing normal [[authentication]] and [[authorization]] mechanisms. Although rootkits can serve a variety of ends, they have gained notoriety primarily as [[malware]], hiding applications that appropriate computing resources or steal passwords without the knowledge of administrators and users of affected systems. Rootkits can target [[firmware]], a [[hypervisor]], the [[kernel (computing)|kernel]], or—most commonly—user-mode applications. Rootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternate, trusted operating system; behavioral-based methods; signature scanning; difference scanning; and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only alternative. ==History== [[File:RootkitRevealer.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of RootkitRevealer, showing the files hidden by the [[Extended Copy Protection]] rootkit]] The first documented [[computer virus]] to target the [[Personal computer|PC]] platform, discovered in 1986, used cloaking techniques to hide itself: the [[Brain (computer virus)|Brain virus]] intercepted attempts to read the [[boot sector]], and redirected these to elsewhere on the disk, where a copy of the original boot sector was kept.<ref name="McAfee1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/threat_center/wp_akapoor_rootkits1_en.pdf|title=Rootkits, Part 1 of 3: The Growing Threat|publisher=[[McAfee]]|date=2006-04-17|accessdate=2010-08-16|format=PDF}}{{broken link|date=December 2010}}</ref> Over time, [[DOS]]-virus cloaking methods became more sophisticated, with advanced techniques including the [[hooking]] of [[INT 13|interrupt 13]] [[application programming interface|application-programming interface]] (API) calls to hide unauthorized modifications to files.<ref name="McAfee1"/> The term ''rootkit'' or ''root kit'' originally referred to a maliciously-modified set of administrative tools for a [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] that granted "[[superuser|root]]" access.<ref name="Symantec">{{Cite paper|url=http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/windows.rootkit.overview.pdf|title=Windows Rootkit Overview| publisher=[[Symantec]] |date=2006-03-26|accessdate=2010-08-17 | format=PDF }}</ref> If an intruder could replace the standard administrative tools on a system with a rootkit, the intruder could obtain root access over the system whilst simultaneously concealing these activities from the legitimate [[system administrator]].

The modified compiler would detect attempts to compile the Unix "login" command and generate altered code that would accept not only the user's correct password, but an additional password known to the attacker. Additionally, the compiler would detect attempts to compile a new version of the compiler, and would insert the same exploits into the new compiler.
