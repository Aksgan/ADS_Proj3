DaimlerChrysler''=== {{Main|SCO v. DaimlerChrysler}} In December [[2003]], SCO demanded that some UNIX licensees certify certain issues regarding their use of Linux. [[DaimlerChrysler]], a former UNIX user and current Linux user, did not respond to this demand. On March 3, 2004 SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their UNIX license agreement by failing to respond to the certification request. Almost every claim SCO made has been ruled against in summary judgment.<ref>Not dismissed, see the [http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/DCHearing-2.pdf hearing transcript, page 15]</ref> The last remaining issue, that of whether DaimlerChrysler made a timely response, was dismissed by agreement of SCO and DaimlerChrysler in December 2004. SCO retains the right to continue this case at a future date, providing it pays legal fees to DaimlerChrysler. ==Other issues and conflicts== ===SCO announces that it will not sue its own customers=== On June 23, 2003, SCO sent out a letter announcing that it would not be suing its own Linux customers.<ref>[http://www.caldera.com/scosource/letter_to_partners.html The SCO Group, Inc. | Scosource | Letter_to_partners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the letter, it states: :"SCO will continue to support our SCO Linux and OpenLinux customers and partners who have previously implemented those products and we will hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding Linux." ===SCO and SGI=== {{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}} In August 2003, SCO presented two examples of what they claimed was illegal copying of copyrighted code from UNIX to Linux. One of the examples ([[Berkeley Packet Filter]]) was not related to original UNIX code at all. The other example did, however, seem to originate from the UNIX code and was apparently contributed by a UNIX vendor, Silicon Graphics. However, an analysis by the Linux community later revealed that: * The code originated from an even older version of UNIX which at some point was published by Caldera (the same Caldera which later became SCO) thus making any claim of copyright infringement shaky. * The code did not do anything. It was in a part of the Linux kernel that was written in anticipation of a Silicon Graphics architecture that was never released. * It had already been removed from the kernel two months earlier. * The contested segment was small (80 lines) and trivial. ===SCO and BayStar Capital=== In October [[2003]], [[BayStar Capital]] and [[Royal Bank of Canada]] invested USD$50 million in The SCO Group to support the legal cost of SCO's Linux campaign. Later it was shown that BayStar was referred to SCO by [[Microsoft]], whose proprietary [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system competes with Linux. In 2003, BayStar looked at SCO on the recommendation of [[Microsoft]], according to Lawrence R. Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar Capital: "It was evident that Microsoft had an agenda".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE1DB173AF931A15757C0A9629C8B63&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=TECHNOLOGY; Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=April 22, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> On April 22, 2004, ''The New York Times'' (p.
