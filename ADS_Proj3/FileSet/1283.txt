are the use of [[liquid nitrogen]] for cooling the [[CMOS]]-based CPUs of the computer. The ETA10 successfully met the company's initial goals (10 [[GFLOPS]]), with some models achieving a cycle time of about 7 ns, which was considered rapid by the standard of the mid-1980s. The planned 1987 follow-on was supposed to be designated Cyber 250 or ETA30, as in 30 GFLOPS. ETA was eventually reincorporated back into CDC, and ETA ceased operations April 17, 1989. ==Operating systems and applications== The ETA10 series could run either ETA's [[EOS (operating system)|EOS]] [[operating system]], which was widely criticized for various problems, or a port by Lachman Associates, a software personnel firm, of [[Unix|UNIX]] [[System V]] (Release 3). While EOS suffered a reputation for poor quality, ETA's UNIX was better received by customers. Use of the ETA10 was rather complicated, and required all programs be loaded via attached [[Apollo Computer]] [[workstation]]s. The program would then run once, and to run again would require re-loading from the Apollo. The ETA10 itself had no graphical console or [[local network]] interface, and all visualization of resulting data was performed by separate workstations after being retrieved from the Apollos. Programming for the ETA10 series could be done in [[FORTRAN]], [[C (programming language)|C]], or [[assembly language]]. ===Criticism=== Despite eventual adoption of [[UNIX]], poorly developed system software remained one flaw of the ETA10 line. According to one description of the system: :Without NSF funding, the von Neumann center could be doomed. "I donâ€™t think we can function without federal support," says Cohen. Even if the center does operate at a vastly reduced level, its machines continue to be plagued by software problems. The NSF review panel found that the ETA10 suffered a software failure once every 30 hours, and that its ability to run programs on more than one of its eight processors at any one time was poor. Although its hardware is still considered state-of-the-art, the overall package is an "extremely immature computer system," the panel concluded. Anderson, Christopher (Nov. 27, 1989). NSF Supercomputer Program Looks Beyond Princeton Recall. ''The Scientist'' '''3''' (23), p. 2. ([http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1989/nov/anderson_p2_891127.html]). It is a mistake to believe that ETA's demise was based solely on operating system choice or existence. The [[Fortran]] compiler (ftn200) had not changed from the CDC205. This compiler retained vendor-specific programming performance features (known as the Q8* subroutine calls) in an era when supercomputer users were realizing the necessity of source code portability between architectures. Additionally, the compiler optimizations were not keeping up with existing technology as shown by the Japanese supercomputer vendors as well as the newer minisupercomputer makers and competition at Cray Research. In general, computer hardware manufacturers prior and up to that period tended to be weak on software. Libraries and available commercial and non-commercial (soon to be called [[open-source]]) applications help an installed base of machine. CDC was relatively weak in this area. It is worth noting that some of the best operating systems that CDC provided to customers were productized versions of an OS written by [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratories]]. According to NASA, the hardware was very poorly designed, and failed to complete any acceptance tests at AMES. See: [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970012375_1997015894.pdf A History of the ETA-10Q Acceptance Tests at NAS] for a much less misleading discussion on criticism than seen above. This one event is considered amongst CDC insiders to be the downfall of ETA, which folded as a result of NASA saying no (and in a domino effect DOD, etc). ==Models== The ETA10-F and ETA10-G (7 ns clock cycle) were the highest-performing members of the ETA10 line, and used liquid nitrogen cooling to achieve rapid cycle times. Less-costly air-cooled versions were later offered, such as the two-processor ETA10-Q (19 ns clock cycle), and the ETA10-P, which was also called "'''Piper'''". Any of the ETA10 models could be built in either single- or multi-processor configurations. ==Performance== Between the highest-performing, liquid-nitrogen cooled models (ETA10-E, G, ''etc.'') and the cheaper, air-cooled models (ETA10-P, Q, ''etc.''), the ETA10 line spanned a 27:1 performance range. Peak performance on the top-of-the-line models reached 10 GFLOPS. According to [[LINPACK]] [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]], an ETA10 with a single processor achieved 52 [[MFLOPS]] on 100^2 LINPACK. ==Description== The ETA10 was a [[multiprocessor]] system that supported up to eight CPUs. Each CPU was similar to that of a two-lane Cyber 205. One of the main innovations of the ETA10 was how the CPU was implemented: the CPU was made of 250 [[CMOS]] [[gate array]] [[integrated circuit]]s mounted on a 44-layer [[printed circuit board]] (PCB). Each gate array contained 20,000 [[Logic gate|gates]] and was fabricated using 1.25-[[micrometre]] (&mu;m) technology that was accessible from the [[VHSIC]] program at Honeywell. In contrast, mainstream commercial technology at the time was in the 3 to 5 &mu;m range. CMOS circuitry, which was not typically used in vector supercomputer CPUs at the time, was chosen because of the high density achievable, which reduces both the on-chip and off-chip delay. The CPU delays were managed through careful tuning of each PCB manufactured in conjunction with the logic technology and incorporated two key technologies known as [[JTAG]] and [[BIST]]. The gate arrays were designed using a combination of internally developed simulator and placement tools, and one of the first commercial [[electronic design automation]] tools (an application for schematic capture) from [[Mentor Graphics]]. Prior to the use of schematic capture at ETA, designers used textual [[netlist]]s to describe the interconnection of the logic circuits. However, CMOS circuitry at that time was significantly slower than that of [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] circuitry, especially the [[emitter-coupled logic]] that was widely used in vector supercomputer CPUs at the time. To compensate for this, the CPU was immersed in -196.15 &deg;C [[liquid nitrogen]] for cooling. Although such cooling could potentially speed up the CMOS logic by a factor of four, in practice the liquid nitrogen cooling yielded an approximately twofold speed increase over air-cooled systems. However, because liquid nitrogen cooling yielded only marginal performance benefits, none of the ETA10 systems used such cooling for either the local or shared memories. It
