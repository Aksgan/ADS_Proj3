The Apple I was [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s first product, demonstrated in April 1976 at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in Palo Alto, California. ==History== The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of $666.66,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-5937610.html|title=Video: Wozniak: $666.66 seemed like a good idea|date=2005-11-07|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> because Wozniak liked repeating digits<ref name="iWoz">[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, Steven]]: "[[iWoz]]", page 180.

Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully assembled circuit board containing about 60+ chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply transformers, power switch, ASCII keyboard, and composite video display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at a cost of $75. [[Image:Woz notebook.png|thumb|left|Excerpt from the later Apple II 'Red' manual, including [[Steve Wozniak]]'s handwritten diagrams for the definition of shape tables]] The Apple I's built-in [[computer terminal]] circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and an inexpensive [[television set]]. Competing machines such as the [[Altair 8800]] generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a [[ASR33|teletypewriter machine]]. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977 the price was dropped to $475.<ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2703 April 1977 Price List | Applefritter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the [[Apple II]] in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.<ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2715 Bill of Sale | Applefritter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Apple had dropped the Apple 1 from its price list by October 1977, officially discontinuing it.<ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2707 October 1977 Price List | Applefritter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As of 2008, an estimated 30 to 50 Apple I computers are still known to exist, making it a very rare [[collectable|collector's item]]. An Apple I reportedly sold for $50,000 USD at auction in 1999, with another apparently selling in 2009 for $17,500; however, a more typical price for an Apple I is in the $14,000&ndash;$16,000 range. In November 2009 the Apple I with serial number 82 was listed on eBay with a starting bid of $50,000 but it is unreported as to whether the computer was actually sold on that occasion. However, in November 2010, this same Apple I (with serial number 82) sold for $178,000 ($213,600 including the 'buyer's premium') at Christie's auction house in London<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11825954 BBC News 24 November 2010 00:48]</ref> , making it by far the highest price paid for this model to date, at £133,250 ($210,000). The high value of this particular example is likely due to the
