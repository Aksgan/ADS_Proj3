as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British.<ref>Crow and Tise, ''The Southern Experience in the American Revolution'' (1978) p. 157-9</ref> Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and controlled the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] coastline. In 1780 they launched a fresh invasion and [[Siege of Charleston|took Charleston]] as well. A significant victory at the [[Battle of Camden]] meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, hoping the Loyalists would rally to the flag. Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army. Behind them much of the territory they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic [[guerrilla war]], fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the gains the British had previously made.<ref>Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)</ref> ====Yorktown 1781==== [[File:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|alt=The siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, paving the way for the end of the American Revolutionary War|The siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, marking effective British defeat]] {{Main|Siege of Yorktown}} The southern British army marched to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet which would take them back to New York.<ref>Harvey p.493-95</ref> When that fleet was defeated by a French fleet at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], the southern British army became trapped at Yorktown.<ref>Harvey p.502-06</ref> In October 1781 under a combined siege by the French and Continental armies under Washington, the British, under the command of General Cornwallis, surrendered their second army of the war.

They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782-83.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''The French Navy and American Independence'' (1975) p. 248</ref> The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible ''coup d'état''. The unrest among officers of the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.<ref>Richard H.

The British abandoned the Indian allies living in this region; they were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. Issues regarding boundaries and debts were not resolved until the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795.<ref>Miller (1948), pp. 616–48</ref> Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their business flourished. ===Impact on Britain=== Losing the war and the 13 colonies was a shock to the British system. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's fiscal-military state when it discovered it suddenly faced powerful enemies, with no allies, and dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption. The result was a powerful crisis, 1776-1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting [[Charles James Fox]] (the leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]]), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the [[French Revolution]] with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case.<ref>William Hague, ''William Pitt the Younger'' (2004)</ref><ref>Jeremy Black, ''George III: America’s Last King''(2006)</ref> ==Immediate aftermath== After the war finally ended in 1783, there was a period of prosperity, with the entire world at peace. The national government, still operating under the Articles of Confederation was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into the new lands, and Vermont, Kentucky and Tennessee became states in the 1790s.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds.
