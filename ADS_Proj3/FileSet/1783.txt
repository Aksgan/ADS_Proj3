The service was introduced in 2007. Prior to that Google used a [[SYSTRAN]] based translator<ref>[http://searchengineland.com/google-translate-drops-systran-for-home-brewed-translation-12502 Google Translate Drops Systran For Home Brewed Translation] 23/12/2007 , Barry Schwartz , ''searchengineland.com''</ref> which is used by other translation services such as [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]], [[AOL]], and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]]. ==Features and limitations== The service limits the number of paragraphs, or range of technical terms, that will be translated. It is also possible to enter searches in a source language that are first translated to a destination language allowing you to browse and interpret results from the selected destination language in the source language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/ |title=Google Translate |accessdate=2009-01-24 |publisher=Google }}</ref> For some languages, users are asked for alternate translations such as for technical terms, to be included for future updates to the translation process. Text in a foreign language can be typed, and if "Detect Language" is selected, it will not only detect the language but also translate it into English by default. Google Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. While it can help the reader to understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations. Some languages produce better results than others. As of 2010, French to English translation is very good;<ref name="tr1">[http://www.tcworld.info/index.php?id=175 Comparison of online machine translation tools] 6/2010 , Ethan Shen , ''www.tcworld.info''</ref> however, rule-based machine translations perform better if the text to be translated is shorter; this effect is particularly evident in Chinese to English translations.<ref name="tr1"/> Texts written in the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Devanagari]], [[Cyrillic]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic]] scripts can be transliterated automatically from phonetic equivalents written in the [[Latin alphabet]]. === Browser integration === A number of [[List of Firefox extensions#Google|Firefox extensions]] exist for Google services, and likewise for Google Translate, which allow right-click command access to the translation service. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=Google+Translate |title=Search Add-ons :: Add-ons for Firefox |accessdate=2009-08-07 |publisher=Mozilla }}</ref> An extension for Google's Chrome browser also exists;<ref>[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=en Google Translate by chrome.translate.extension] ''chrome.google.com''</ref> in February 2010, Google translate was integrated into the standard Google Chrome browser for automatic webpage translation.<ref>[http://www.ghacks.net/2010/02/07/google-translate-integrated-in-google-chrome-5/ Google Translate Integrated In Google Chrome 5]</ref><ref>[http://stuff.techwhack.com/8388-google-chrome-5-translate Google Chrome 5 features an integrated Google Translate service] 15/2/2010 , ''stuff.techwhack.com''</ref> ===Android version=== Created by Google Inc.
