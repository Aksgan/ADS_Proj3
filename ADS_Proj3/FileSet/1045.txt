Forrester]</ref> The programmer, Richard Bennett, chose to implement a system (SIMPLE - "Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations") that took coded equations as symbolic input and computed solutions. SIMPLE became the proof-of-concept for DYNAMO: rather than have a specialist programmer "hard-code" a special-purpose solver in a general purpose programming language, users could specify a system's equations in a special simulation language and get simulation output from one program execution. ==Design goals== DYNAMO was designed to emphasize the following: * ease-of-use for the industrial dynamics modeling community (who were not assumed to be expert programmers); * immediate execution of the compiled model, without producing an intermediate object file; and * providing graphical output, with [[line printer]] and [[pen plotter]] graphics. Among the ways in which DYNAMO was above the standard of the time, it featured [[Dimensional analysis|units checking]] of numerical types and relatively clear error messages. ==Impact and Issues== Apart from its (indirectly-felt) public impact in environmental issues raised by the controversy over ''Limits to Growth'', DYNAMO was influential in the history of discrete-event simulation even though it was essentially a package for continuous simulation specified through [[difference equations]].<ref>"A History of Discrete Event Simulation Programming Languages", Richard E.
