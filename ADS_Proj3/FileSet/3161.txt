generated by multiple systems, such as the limbic system, with conflicting priorities is a debated issue within neuroeconomics, and remains an area of active research.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> === Social decision making === Social situations offer a useful way for understanding more complex forms of decisions, which may better approximate many of our real-life choices.<ref name="sciencemag.org">Sanfey,A. (2007). Social Decision-Making: Insights from Game Theory and Neuroscience. Science , 318, 5850. Retrieved from: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5850/598</ref> The research on social decision making in neuroeconomics aims to answer the question of what does our brains choose to focus on when faced with a social situation. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying social decision making is the central focus of this line of research.<ref name="neuroeconomics.duke.edu"/> Neuroeconomics uses various tools in examining social decision making. From economics, it uses the models and tasks of [[game theory]] which attempts to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations in which an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others. Psychological findings and tools from cognitive psychology and social psychology are also used. Finally, imaging techniques from neuroscience are used to observe neural activity in different brain structures. By integrating various tools and fields, theoretical models of how we make decisions in a rich, interactive environment can be advanced.<ref name="sciencemag.org"/> ==Methodology== [[Behavioral economics]] experiments record the subject's decision over various design parameters and use the data to generate formal models that predict performance. Neuroeconomics extends this approach by adding observation of the nervous system to the set of explanatory variables. The goal of neuroeconomics is to inform the creation and contribute another layer of data to the testable hypotheses of these models{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. ===Neural recording techniques=== In neuroeconomic experiments, brain scans can be performed using [[fMRI]], [[Positron Emission Tomography|PET]] or other [[functional neuroimaging]] tools in order to compare the roles of the different brain areas that contribute to economic decision-making.<ref name="pmid16216680">{{cite journal |author=Kenning P, Plassmann H |title=Neuroeconomics: an overview from an economic perspective |journal=Brain Res. Bull. |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=343–54 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16216680 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.07.006 }}</ref> Other experiments measure ERP ([[event-related potential]]s, or use [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]) and MEG ([[magnetoencephalograms]]) to measure the timecourses of different brain events.<ref name="pmid16216680"/> Direct recordings of neuronal activity and [[neurotransmitter]] concentrations in monkeys and in humans can also be carried out. In addition, knowledge of brain activity can invite causal experiments in which choices are actually influenced by exogeneous causal manipulations. (This is important from the point of view of standard economic theory, because in standard theory choices only change when preferences, income, prices, or information change; so any other variable which influences choice must be interpreted in those terms.) For example, TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), lesions to brain areas ("the lesion method"), pharmacological interventions, and simpler exogeneous variations like cognitive load and priming can all potentially influence choices. ==Experiments== In a typical behavioral economics experiment, a subject is asked to make a series of economic decisions. For example, a subject may be asked whether they prefer to have 45 cents or a gamble with a 50% chance of one dollar and 50% chance of nothing. The experimenter will then measure different variables in order to determine what is going on in the subject's brain as they make the decision. Some authors have demonstrated that Neuroeconomics' tools may be useful not only to describe experiments involving rewarding but may also be applied in order to describe the psychological behavior of common psychiatric syndromes involving addiction as well as delusion.

Several universities are conducting direct research on the field, such as New York University, Duke University, and George Mason University.<ref>[https://files.nyu.edu/avs265/public/whatisneuroeconomics.html Neuroeconomics]</ref> Furthermore, some programs actually offer a degree in Neuroeconomics. Claremont Graduate University is the first institution to offer a PhD in Neuroeconomics; it is ranked as one of the best Neuroeconomics institutes in the United States.<ref>[https://files.nyu.edu/avs265/public/reviewofneuroeconomicprograms.html Here is a Review of Neuroeconomic Programs in the United States]</ref> Caltech now (c 2007) has a Behavioral and Social Neuroscience (BSN) PhD in either CNS or HSS,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/ss/postdocs |title=Caltech: Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher=Hss.caltech.edu |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> mixing economic theory, neurobiology, computational neuroscience,dynamic causal modeling and neuroscientific techniques.
