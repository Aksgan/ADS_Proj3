their patents on smaller corporations. However, it is not possible to completely avoid patented technology, because no mechanism for avoiding patent-related risk exists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===SME disadvantage=== *Software patents may affect [[open source]] and [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) that do not have a large defensive [[patent portfolio]]. ** The number of patents filed is not a measure of inventiveness. The value to society should not be measured by inventiveness. ** Open source and small to medium companies might believe they are inventive in creating new ideas and software, but may be blocked from doing so by an existing patent on one of the algorithms they desire to use, originally created another person, that ends up blocking all uses without a proper license.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===Certain ideas are not patentable=== *Granting a patent on an idea when it is not sufficiently offset by a balanced disclosure of an associated method of manufacture of material goods will harm society. It only prevents use of the idea without the corresponding benefit to society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} *For a software or computer-implemented inventions to be patented, it needs to be disclosed in a manner sufficient clear and complete for [[person skilled in the art|one skilled in the art]] to [[reduction to practice|reduce it to practice]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ** Since all software are just descriptions of ideas, it is not clear which software can be inventions and which cannot.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ** All software can be reduced to practice trivially by running it in a computer, but the courts are undecided about how this affects patentability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ** Source code for software is the preferred form for making modifications to the software, so it would seem that "sufficiently clear" should mean "source code for the invention is disclosed".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} *Pure mathematical algorithms are not patentable in the United States (see [[State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group|State Street decision]]). Similar conditions for patentability apply in other jurisdictions, such as Japan and Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===Software patents are not useful=== *Some patent disclosures in the software field are not readable to some programmers; they are neither used nor useful as a source of technical information.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-5076320.html |title=Software patents need shelter from the storm |publisher=ZDNet - Tech News}}</ref> Though a skilled programmer usually has little trouble generating code to solve a problem when presented with a detailed algorithm for the solution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===Patent examination is too slow=== *For 2005, the projected average pendency for patent applications in the "Computer Architecture, Software & Information Security" department of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was 3 and a half years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/annual/2005/060404_table4.html |title=Table 4: Patent Pendency Statistics |publisher=United States Patent Office}}</ref> *In Europe, the average time taken to grant a patent in any field of technology was almost 4 years in 2005,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://annual-report.european-patent-office.org/2005/business_report/patent_process/index.en.php#pru |title=The patent process |publisher=European Patent Office}}</ref> with the computer related fields probably being greater than the average. By the time patent applications issue as patents, the inventions claimed therein will be perceived to be already in the public domain. This hurts inventors who see their inventions copied without permission, investors who fail to earn a suitable return on the salaries they paid to inventors and the public, which is faced with the uncertain prospects as to exactly what inventions are in the public domain and which inventions will be covered by a pending patent application.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} **Patents may be very different from the published applications, so the published application may only serve as a guide to the final scope of protection.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===Purchase of existing patents=== *Software patents allow investment companies to purchase patents from others and generate lawsuits to collect revenue off the monopoly granted by the patent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2005/jun/20/comment.comment |title=Patent absurdity] |last=Stallman |first=Richard |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2005-06-20 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> Some believe it to be offensive that a company that does not create software might benefit from a patent for software. Others believe that these patents are generally purchased by highly speculative investors from software producing companies that were looking for investments (e.g., companies having financial trouble, companies moving out of a particular business area, etc.) and thereby provide needed capital investment into the software industry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/mar07/4943 |title=Hooray for the Patent Troll! |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |last=Rubin |first=Steven |month=March | year=2007 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> *These investment companies are sometimes referred to by the derogatory terms "patent parasites" or, more commonly, [[patent trolls]] and are a consequence of the possible high damage awards that litigation in the US may provide, not of software patents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=116783&d=122&h=24&f=46 |title=Beware of the troll|publisher=The Lawyer|date=2005-09-26|accessdate=2007-07-27 |last=Macdonald |first=Morag}}</ref> == U.S. Court Cases == === Bilski === {{Main|In re Bilski}} The most prominent case believed to decide the future of software patents is currently being decided upon by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. [[In re Bilski|Bilski]], as the case is commonly known, deals with the legality of patenting business methods. Bilski and his partner Warsaw applied for and were denied a patent for their business method of hedging risks in commodities trading.<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/go/com/sol/2007-1130bilski_joint_appendix.pdf Appendix of I re Bernard L.

The patent examiner rejected the patent on the grounds that it was not implemented in a specific apparatus and was purely abstract in nature.<ref name="BPAI2008">[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/dcom/bpai/its/fd022257.pdf BPAI decision rejecting the patent application] (retrieved December 21, 2008).</ref> Bilski brought the rejection to the patent office's appeals board who affirmed the rejection, although citing the error of the examiner for basing his analysis on the technological arts. The case was then heard [[en banc]] in front of the US Federal Circuit Court and the rejection was again affirmed, with Bilski's patent request failing the so-called "machine-transformation" test. The case was heard by the US Supreme Court on November 9, 2009 and issued an opinion on appeal (as ''[[Bilski v.
