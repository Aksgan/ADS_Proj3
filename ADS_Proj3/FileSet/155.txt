The term '''allative''' is generally used for the [[lative case]] in the majority of languages which do not make finer distinctions. ==Finnish language== In the [[Finnish language]], the allative is the fifth of the locative [[declension|cases]], with the basic meaning of "onto". Its ending is ''-lle'', for example ''pöytä'' (table) and ''pöydälle'' (onto the top of the table). In addition, it is the logical complement of the [[adessive case]] for referring to "being around the place". For example, ''koululle'' means "to the vicinity of the school". With time, the use is the same: ''ruokatunti'' (lunch break) and ''... lähti ruokatunnille'' ("... left to the lunch break"). Some actions require the case, e.g. ''kävely'' - ''mennä kävelylle'' "a walk - go for a walk". The other locative cases in Finnish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] are: *[[Inessive case]] ("in") *[[Elative case]] ("out of") *[[Illative case]] ("into") *[[Adessive case]] ("on") *[[Ablative case]] ("from off of") ==Baltic languages== In the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language]]s the allative had been used dialectally as an innovation since the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]], but it is almost out of use in modern times. Its ending in Lithuanian is ''-op'' which was shortened from ''-opi'', whereas its ending in Latvian is ''-up''. In the modern languages the remains of the allative can be found in certain fixed expressions that have become [[adverb]]s, such as '''Lit.''' ''išėjo Dievop'' ("gone to God", i.e. died), ''velniop!'' ("to hell!"), ''nuteisti myriop'' ("[[death sentence|sentence to death]]"), ''rudeniop'' ("towards autumn"), ''vakarop'' ("towards the evening") , '''Lat.''' ''mājup'' ("towards home"), ''kalnup'' ("uphill"), ''lejup'' ("downhill"). ==Greek== In [[Mycenaean Greek]], an [[enclitic]] ''-de'' ending is used to denote an allative.<ref>Ventris, Michael and John Chadwick. ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek''</ref> This ending survives into [[Ancient Greek]] in words such as {{Unicode|''Athē&#769;naze''}},<ref>{{LSJ|*)aqh{{=}}nai|Ἀθῆναι|ref}}</ref> from accusative {{Unicode|''Athē&#769;nās''}} + ''-de''. ==Accusative== The [[Latin]] accusative of towns and small islands is used for motion towards,<ref>Allen and Greenough, sect. 427</ref> like the allative case. ==References== {{reflist}} {{Grammatical cases}} {{Ling-morph-stub}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Allative Case}} [[Category:Grammatical cases]] [[br:Troad allativel]] [[bg:Алатив]] [[ca:Cas al·latiu]] [[cs:Allativ]] [[de:Allativ]] [[es:Caso adlativo]] [[eo:Alativo]] [[fr:Allatif]] [[it:Allativo]] [[hu:Allativus]] [[mk:Алатив]] [[nl:Allatief]] [[no:Allativ]] [[nn:Allativ]] [[pl:Allatyw]] [[pt:Caso alativo]] [[ru:Аллатив]] [[fi:Allatiivi]] [[sv:Allativ]] [[vec:Ałativo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1514</id> <title>Allegro library</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Allegro | screenshot = [[Image:Allegro-logo.png|160px]] | caption = Logo | developer = Allegro developers | latest release version = 4.4.1.1 | latest release date = {{release date|2010|03|03}} | latest preview version = 5.0.0 RC 4 | latest preview date = {{release date|2010|12|31}} | operating system = [[Cross-platform]] | genre = [[Multimedia]] and [[Video game|Games]] [[Software development kit|SDK]] | license = Allegro 4: [[Giftware]] Allegro 5: [[Zlib license|zlib]] | website = http://alleg.sourceforge.net [http://www.allegro.cc/ http://www.allegro.cc] }} '''Allegro''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] [[software library]] for [[video game]] development. <ref>{{cite book | last = Harbour | first = Jonathan | authorlink = | title = Game Programming All in One, Second Edition | publisher = Course Technology PTR | series = | year = 2004 | doi = | isbn = 1592003834}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book | last = Steinke | first = Lennart | authorlink = | title = Spielprogrammierung | publisher = BHV Verlag | series = | year = 2003 | doi = | isbn = 3826680758 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite book | last = P.

As of version 4.0, programs that use the library work on [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[BeOS]], [[Mac OS X]], and various [[Unix-like|Unix-like systems]] with (or without) [[X Window System]], abstracting their [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) into one portable interface. There is also an independent port of Allegro on [[AmigaOS 4]]. The library is written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and designed to be used with C or [[C++]]. It comes with extensive documentation and many examples. ==Addons== The community of Allegro users have contributed several library extensions to handle things like scrolling tile maps and import and export of various file formats (e.g. [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[JPEG]] images, [[MPEG]] video, [[Ogg]], [[MP3]], [[Impulse Tracker|IT]], [[S3M (file format)|S3M]], [[XM (mod format)|XM music]], [[TrueType|TTF]] [[typeface|fonts]], and more). There are also bindings for several programming languages available, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]] and others. Allegro can be used in conjunction with [[OpenGL]] by using the library ''AllegroGL'' which extends Allegro's functionality into OpenGL and therefore the hardware. ==History== Initially standing for "'''A'''tari '''L'''ow-'''Le'''vel '''G'''ame
