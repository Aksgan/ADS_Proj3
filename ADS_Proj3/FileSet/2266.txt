used in this way. Application of any fluid will disturb the paper surface fibers or sizing. Fumes created from heating iodine crystals will develop the writing, which will appear brown because the iodine sticks preferentially to the disturbed areas of the paper. Exposing the paper to strong sunlight will return the writing to its invisible state, as will using a bleach solution. Slightly dampening paper with a sponge or by steam and then drying it before writing a message, will prevent writing from being developed by this method. But overdoing dampening will result in telltale paper cockling. ===Disappearing inks=== Inks that are visible for a period of time without the intention of being made visible again are called disappearing inks. Disappearing inks typically rely on the chemical reaction between [[thymolphthalein]] and a basic substance such as sodium hydroxide. Thymolphthalein, which is normally colorless, turns blue in solution with the base. As the base reacts with carbon dioxide (always present in the air), the pH drops below 10.5 and the color disappears.<ref>[http://www.uwm.edu/~tholme/fun/disink.htm Disappearing Ink<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref> Pens are now also available that can be erased simply by swiping a special pen over the original text. Disappearing inks have been used in gag squirtguns, for limited-time secret messages, for security reasons on non-reusable passes, and for fraudulent purposes.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3870/is_4_18/ai_84455433 Bad sign - Newswatch - disappearing ink used in fraud - Brief Article | CFO: Magazine for Senior Financial Executives | Find Articles at BNET<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tv.com/exhibit-a/schemes-and-dreams/episode/880177/recap.html Exhibit A: Schemes and Dreams Recap - TV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Modern relevance of invisible ink messages== As an indication of security, most inks mentioned above were already known by the end of [[World War I]]. However, in 1999 the [[U.S.]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] successfully requested that a 1940's technical report on invisible ink remained exempt from mandatory [[declassification]], based on the claim that invisible ink was still relevant to [[national security]].<ref>[http://www.fas.org/sgp/news/1999/06/spt062399.html]</ref> The report thus remains classified.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/13/news/cl-9673 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=The Very Visible Battle Over Invisible Ink | first=Bill | last=Miller | date=2001-06-13 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Former MI-6 agent Richard Tomlinson alleges that ''Pentel Rolling Writer'' rollerball pens were extensively used by MI-6 agents to produce secret writing (invisible messages) while on missions.<ref>Tomlinson, Richard: The Big Breach: From Top Secret to Maximum Security, pg 44.
