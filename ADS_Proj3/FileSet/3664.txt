longer possible, due to the [[no-cloning theorem]], which forbids the creation of identical copies of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. So a single qubit can not be repeated three times as in the previous example, as any measurement of the qubit will change its [[wave function]]. Nevertheless, in a quantum computer, there is another method, which is called the three qubits bit flip code. It uses entanglement and syndrome measurements, and can perform the similar results to the repetition code. [[Image:Quantum error correction of bit flip using three qubits.svg‎|350px|thumb|right|[[Quantum circuit]] of the bit flip code]] Let <math>|\psi\rangle = \alpha_0|0\rangle + \alpha_1|1\rangle</math> be an arbitrary qubit. The first step of the three qubit bit flip code is to entangle the qubit with two other qubits using two [[Controlled NOT gate|CNOT gates]] with input <math>|0\rangle</math>.<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Michael A. Nielsen]] and [[Isaac L. Chuang]] | title = Quantum Computation and Quantum Information | journal = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000}} </ref> The result will be <math>|\psi'\rangle= \alpha_0 |000\rangle + \alpha_1|111\rangle. </math> This is just a tensor product of three qubits, and different from cloning a state. Now these qubits will be sent through a channel <math>E_{\text{bit}}</math> where we assume that at most one bit flip may occur. For example, in the case where the first qubit were be flipped, the result would be <math>|\psi'_r\rangle=\alpha_0|100\rangle + \alpha_1|011\rangle</math>. To diagnose bit flips in any of the three possible qubits, syndrome diagnosis is needed, which includes four projection operators: <math>P_0=|000\rangle\langle000|+|111\rangle\langle111|</math> <math>P_1=|100\rangle\langle100|+|011\rangle\langle011|</math> <math>P_2=|010\rangle\langle010|+|101\rangle\langle101|</math> <math>P_3=|001\rangle\langle001|+|110\rangle\langle110|</math> It can be obtained: <math>\langle\psi'_r|P_0|\psi'_r\rangle = 0</math> <math>\langle\psi'_r|P_1|\psi'_r\rangle = 1</math> <math>\langle\psi'_r|P_2|\psi'_r\rangle = 0</math> <math>\langle\psi'_r|P_3|\psi'_r\rangle = 0</math> So it will be known that the error syndrome corresponding to <math>P_1</math>. This three qubits bit flip code can correct one error if at most one bit-flip-error occurred in the channel. It is similar to the three bits repetition code in a classical computer. ==The sign flip code== [[Image:Quantum error correction of phase flip using three qubits.svg|450px|thumb|right|[[Quantum circuit]] of the phase flip code]] Flipped bits are the only kind of error in classical computer, but there is another possibility of an error with quantum computers, the sign flip. Through the transmission in a channel the relative sign between <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math> can become inverted. For instance, a qubit in the state <math>|-\rangle=(|0\rangle-|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}</math> may have its sign flip to <math>|+\rangle=(|0\rangle+|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}.</math> The original state of the qubit <math>|\psi\rangle = \alpha_0|+\rangle+\alpha_1|-\rangle</math> will be changed into the state <math>|\psi'\rangle = \alpha_0|+++\rangle+\alpha_1|---\rangle.</math> In the Hadamard basis, bit flips become sign flips and sign flips become bit flips. Let <math>E_\text{phase}</math> be a quantum channel that can cause a most one phase flip. Then the bit flip code from above can recover <math>|\psi\rangle</math> by transforming into the Hadamard basis before and after transmission through <math>E_\text{phase}</math>. ==The Shor code== The error channel may induce either a bit flip, a sign flip, or both. It is possible to correct for both types of errors using one code, and the Shor code does just that. In fact, the Shor code corrects arbitrary single-qubit errors. [[Image:Shore code.svg‎|500px|thumb|right|[[Quantum circuit]] of the Shor code]] Let <math>E</math> be a quantum channel that can arbitrarily corrupt a single qubit. The 1st, 4th and 7th qubits are for the sign flip code, while the three group of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are designed for the bit flip code. With the Shor code, a qubit state <math>|\psi\rangle=\alpha_0|0\rangle+\alpha_1|1\rangle</math> will be transformed into the product of 9 qubits <math>|\psi'\rangle=\alpha_0|0_S\rangle+\alpha_1|1_S\rangle</math>, where : <math>|0_S\rangle=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}(|000\rangle + |111\rangle) \otimes (|000\rangle + |111\rangle) \otimes (|000\rangle + |111\rangle)</math> : <math>|1_S\rangle=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}(|000\rangle - |111\rangle) \otimes (|000\rangle - |111\rangle) \otimes (|000\rangle - |111\rangle)</math> If a bit flip error happens to a qubit, the syndrome analysis will be performed on each set of states (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9), then correct the error. If the three bit flip group (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are considered as three inputs, then the Shor code circuit can be reduced as a sign flip code. This means that the Shor code can also repair sign flip error for a single qubit<ref>{{cite journal | last = W.Shor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter W. Shor | title = Scheme for reducing decoherence in quantum computer memory | journal = AT&T Bell Laboratories | url = http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v52/pR2493 | year = 1995 }} </ref>. The Shor code also can correct for any arbitrary errors (both bit flip and sign flip) to a single qubit. If an error is modeled by a unitary transform U, which will act on a qubit <math>|\psi\rangle</math>, then <math>U</math> can be described in the form : <math>U=c_0I+c_1\sigma_x+c_2\sigma_y+c_3\sigma_z</math> where <math>c_0</math>,<math>c_1</math>,<math>c_2</math>, and <math>c_3</math> are complex constants, I is the identity, and the [[Pauli matrices]] are given by : <math>\sigma_x=\biggl( \begin{matrix} 0&1\\1&0 \end{matrix} \biggr);</math> : <math>\sigma_y=\biggl( \begin{matrix} 0&-i\\i&0 \end{matrix} \biggr);</math> : <math>\sigma_z=\biggl( \begin{matrix} 1&0\\0&-1 \end{matrix} \biggr)</math> If U is equal to I, then no error occurs. If <math>U=\sigma_x</math>, a bit flip error occurs. If <math>U=\sigma_z</math>, a sign flip error occurs. If <math>U=i\sigma_y</math> then both a bit flip error and a sign flip error occur. Due to linearity, it follows that the Shor code can correct arbitrary 1-qubit errors. ==General codes== In general, a ''quantum code'' for a [[quantum channel]] <math>\mathcal{E}</math> is a subspace <math>\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{H}</math>, where <math>\mathcal{H}</math> is the state Hilbert space, such that there exists another quantum channel <math>\mathcal{R}</math> with <math> (\mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{E})(\rho) = \rho \quad \forall \rho = P_{\mathcal{C}}\rho P_{\mathcal{C}}, </math> where <math>P_{\mathcal{C}}</math> is the [[orthogonal projection]] onto <math>\mathcal{C}</math>. Here <math>\mathcal{R}</math> is known as the ''correction operation''. ==Models== Over time, researchers have come up with several codes: * [[Peter Shor]]'s 9-qubit-code, a.k.a. the [[Shor code]], encodes 1 logical qubit in 9 physical qubits and can correct for arbitrary errors in a single qubit. * [[Andrew Steane]] found a code which does the same with 7 instead of 9 qubits, see [[Steane code]]. * [[Raymond Laflamme]] found a class of 5-qubit codes which do the same, which also have the property of being [[fault-tolerant]]. * A generalisation of this concept are the [[CSS code]]s, named for their inventors: [[A. R. Calderbank]], [[Peter
