him at Ragnar Anchorage.) Doral appears again on Cylon-occupied [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]] curiously monitoring the situation developing between Sharon and [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]]. He initially decides that Sharon cannot be trusted, and orders Number Six to deal with her. Once Doral discovers that Sharon is pregnant, he states the child is a miracle, and must be protected at all costs. The discovery also leads to his suggesting a major tactical change, although the details of this new plan, as well as whatever changes were made from the original, have as yet to be clearly defined in the series. The Doral Cylons seem to act more covertly, having an unassuming "average" appearance in order to better blend in with more trivial background matters instead of taking more noticeable positions of authority and purpose. He seems to have a position of authority among the Cylons, acting as overseer, and having a hand behind their decision making and tactical planning. This personalization is contradicted, however, in the special TV movie "[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]," in which a copy of Cavil berates a confused Doral copy (wearing clothing nearly identical to the first copy encountered by the Colonials) for his lack of disguise and caution while wandering the halls of Galactica. A later scene shows a small group of Doral copies assigned to menial labor on occupied Caprica, doing work they complain is below them and should be handled by centurions. Likewise, in the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]," a copy of Doral can be seen serving drinks to other humanoid Cylons. These scenes seem to imply the Doral models are of lower intelligence than other Cylon models, and possess less authority. The Doral Cylons appear to be more fanatical, militant and cold-hearted than the other humanoid Cylons encountered thus far, short of the often vile, overtly vicious [[Brother Cavil]]. They calmly discuss the genocide of mankind (stating on one occasion "They [humans] would have destroyed themselves anyway. They deserve what they got."), and unhesitatingly conducting (on at least one occasion) a suicide bombing aboard ''Galactica''<ref>[[Litmus (Battlestar Galactica)|Litmus]]</ref>. On the other hand, Doral was highly critical of the human suicide bombers in "[[Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)|Occupation]]" who inflicted Cylon casualties and fatalities, lambasting them for a 'lack of nobility'. In "[[Torn(Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]" a Number Eight accuses Doral of "barely even being able to say [God's] name." == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [[BattlestarWiki:Number Five|Number Five]] at the [[Battlestar Wiki]]. {{GalacticaCharacters}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Doral, Aaron}} [[Category:Cylons]] [[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]] [[Category:Fictional cyborgs]] [[Category:Fictional robots]] [[Category:Fictional clones]] [[fr:Numéro Cinq (Battlestar Galactica)]] [[pl:Aaron Doral]]</text> </page> <page> <id>672</id> <title>Abated</title> <text>:''See also, [[Abatement]].''

The site offers a protected and nurturing environment where these children can overcome the social isolation often associated with having such challenges, and connect with friends, mentors, homework tutors and job search coaches. The site was founded in 1991 by [[Arlette Lefebvre|Dr. Arlette Lefebvre]] (aka "Dr. Froggie") from the [[Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and Brian Hillis with the goal of helping to inspire children to feel good about themselves, to understand that there are others who have faced (and overcome) similar challenges, and to provide the social networks and skills required to help them integrate more fully into their communities. Membership is open to kids of all ages and their families and caregivers, and is free of charge. Members are manually screened and verified prior to being given access to the site, and all public messages on the site are monitored by police-screened volunteers. ==External links== * [http://www.ablelink.org/ Ability Online] [[Category:Bulletin board systems]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] {{website-stub}} {{toronto-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>687</id> <title>Ability Plus</title> <text>[[Image:AbilityPlus3 0.png|thumb|alt=Screen shot of Ability Plus 3.0|Screen shot of Ability Plus 3.0]]'''Ability Plus''' is an integrated software package written for DOS in the early 80s. Development ceased in 1995 with the last build made in November 1997. It was succeeded by Ability Office on Windows, described below. Ability combined write, spreadsheet, database, graphing and communication functions in a single interface called the Library Screen. The main modules were written from the ground up to share as much code as possible so that, for example, a field in the write or database module would call on the same recalculation engine as the spreadsheet and the display and print routines were common to all. Despite lack of development for over a decade, Ability Plus 3.0, the last version, will still run quite happily under a [[Windows 7]] command prompt. ==Marketing History== Xanaro Technologies, in Toronto, Ontario, initially sought to market Ability<ref name="xanaro">[http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Business/IBM-Office-System-May-Outstrip-Competition-DDB-Left-Holding-Atari-IOU.html faqs.org], Business abstract 1984.</ref> in 1984. After a business reorganization at the request of the investors, the product was taken over by Migent Inc, Incline Village, Nevada, around 1984/85 and released as Ability 1.2 in 1985. A new version called Ability Plus was released in 1987 by Migent, that saw the product translated into a French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and other European languages. Around this time in Europe, Ability 1.2 and Ability Plus 1.0 were widely bundled with the [[Amstrad 1512]] and 1640 personal computers. In 1987 Ability Plus won the Barclays Bank British Micro Computing Award. Migent Inc had several products, including the first "pocket modem", but fell into financial difficulty for reasons largely unrelated to Ability (for example, see Migent vs [[Ashton-Tate]]<ref name="emeraldbay">[http://corphist.computerhistory.org/corphist/view.php?s=documents&id=899&PHPSESSID=ccd241...

Migent (UK) Ltd, based in London, continued for a few more years, eventually closing in 1991. Later on in 1991, a
