Each is responsible for a different speciality within the medical field. They are general charged with supervising the training of doctors within that speciality, although that responsibility has been somewhat taken over by the [[Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board]] in recent years. The medical royal colleges include: *[[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (Established 1800<ref name="estdate">{{cite web | title = History of the Academy | publisher = [[Academy of Medical Royal Colleges]] | url = http://www.aomrc.org.uk/pages/history.htm | accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>) *[[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (Est. 1505<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of Physicians]] (Est. 1518<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College Of Paediatrics and Child Health|Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health]] (Est. 1996<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] (Est. 1930<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of General Practitioners]] (Est. 1952<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of Anaesthetists]] (Est. 1992<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of Radiologists]] (Est. 1975<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] (Est. 1971<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of Pathologists]] (Est. 1970<ref name="estdate"/>) *[[Royal College of Ophthalmologists]] (Est. 1988<ref name="estdate"/>) The medical royal colleges are represented by the [[Academy of Medical Royal Colleges]]. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.aomrc.org.uk Academy of Medical Royal Colleges] [[Category:Health organisations in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:British medical associations]] [[Category:British professional bodies]] [[Category:Health and medicine related organisations in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Royal Colleges]] [[es:Colegio Médico]] [[fr:Ordre des médecins]] {{UK-med-org-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>23947</id> <title>Medical ultrasonography</title> <text>{{About|using ultrasound to image the human body|imaging of animals in research|Preclinical imaging}} {{Redirect|Sonography|the tactile alphabet called "sonography"|Night writing}} {{Mergefrom|Ultrasound#Diagnostic sonography|date=April 2010}} '''Diagnostic sonography''' ('''ultrasonography''') is an [[ultrasound]]-based diagnostic [[medical imaging|imaging]] technique used for visualizing subcutaneous body structures including [[tendons]], [[muscles]], joints, vessels and internal organs for possible pathology or [[lesion]]s. [[Obstetric ultrasonography|Obstetric sonography]] is commonly used during [[pregnancy]] and is widely recognized by the public. In physics, the term "ultrasound" applies to all [[acoustic energy]] (longitudinal, [[mechanical wave]]) with a frequency above the audible range of human hearing. The audible range of sound is 20 hertz-20 kilohertz. Ultrasound is frequency greater than 20 kilohertz. ==Diagnostic applications== {{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}} [[Image:Head-3D.jpg|thumb|right|Orthogonal planes of a 3 dimensional sonographic volume with transverse and coronal measurements for estimating fetal cranial volume.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://jdm.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/5/205 |title="Foetal Biometry: Vertical Calvarial Diameter and Calvarial Volume ".

The choice of frequency is a trade-off between spatial resolution of the image and imaging depth: lower frequencies produce less resolution but image deeper into the body. Sonography (ultrasonography) is widely used in [[medicine]]. It is possible to perform both [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and therapeutic procedures, using ultrasound to guide interventional procedures (for instance [[biopsy|biopsies]] or drainage of fluid collections). [[Sonographer]]s are medical [[professional]]s who perform scans for diagnostic purposes. Sonographers typically use a hand-held probe (called a transducer) that is placed directly on and moved over the patient. Sonography is effective for imaging soft tissues of the body. Superficial structures such as [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[testes]], [[breast]] and the [[neonatal]] brain are imaged at a higher [[frequency]] (7-18 MHz), which provides better axial and lateral [[Angular resolution|resolution]]. Deeper structures such as liver and kidney are imaged at a lower frequency 1-6 MHz with lower axial and lateral resolution but greater penetration. Medical sonography is used in the study of many different systems: {| class="wikitable" |- ! System ! Description !
