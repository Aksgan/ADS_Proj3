The stem need not be identical to the [[morphological root]] of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. [[Algorithm]]s for stemming have been studied in [[computer science]] since 1968. Many [[search engine]]s treat words with the same stem as [[synonym]]s as a kind of [[query broadening]], a process called '''conflation'''. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as '''stemming algorithms''' or '''stemmers'''. ==Examples== A stemmer for [[English language|English]], for example, should identify the [[string literal|string]] "cats" (and possibly "catlike", "catty" etc.) as based on the root "cat", and "stemmer", "stemming", "stemmed" as based on "stem". A stemming algorithm reduces the words "fishing", "fished", "fish", and "fisher" to the root word, "fish". ==History== The first ever published stemmer was written by Julie Beth Lovins in 1968.<ref>Julie Beth Lovins (1968). Development of a stemming algorithm. Mechanical Translation and Computational Linguistics '''11''':22–31.</ref> This paper was remarkable for its early date and had great influence on later work in this area. A later stemmer was written by [[Martin Porter]] and was published in the July 1980 issue of the journal ''Program''. This stemmer was very widely used and became the de-facto standard algorithm used for English stemming. Dr. Porter received the [[Tony Kent Strix award]] in 2000 for his work on stemming and information retrieval. Many implementations of the Porter stemming algorithm were written and freely distributed; however, many of these implementations contained subtle flaws. As a result, these stemmers did not match their potential. To eliminate this source of error, Martin Porter released an official [http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/ free-software implementation] of the algorithm around the year 2000. He extended this work over the next few years by building [[Snowball programming language|Snowball]], a framework for writing stemming algorithms, and implemented an improved English stemmer together with stemmers for several other languages. ==Algorithms== There are several types of stemming algorithms which differ in respect to performance and accuracy and how certain stemming obstacles are overcome. ===Brute-force algorithms=== [[Brute-force search|Brute force]] stemmers employ a [[lookup table]] which contains relations between root forms and inflected forms. To stem a word, the
