definition different in these two modes, though 3D pilots may configure their models to be much more responsive. ==Construction== Construction is typically of plastic, glass-reinforced plastic, aluminium or carbon fiber. Rotor blades are typically made of wood, fiberglass or carbon fiber. Models are typically purchased in kit form from one of about a dozen popular manufacturers and take 5 to 20 hours to completely assemble. These model helicopters contain many moving parts analogous to those on full-size helicopters, from the [[Swashplate (helicopter)|swashplate]] to [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]] and everything in between. The construction of helicopters has to be more precise than for fixed-wing model aircraft, because helicopters are susceptible to even the smallest of vibrations, which can cause problems when the helicopter is in flight. Additionally, the small size and low weight of R/C helicopters and their components means that control inputs, especially cyclic (pitch and roll) can have a very fast response, and cause a rotation rate much faster than the equivalent input might produce on a full-size aircraft. In some cases, this quick response can make the model unnecessarily difficult to fly. For this reason, most model helicopters do not use the (simpler) Bell rotor head design, but instead use the Hiller design with a [[Helicopter_rotor#Stabilizer_bar|flybar]], or Bell-Hiller mixing, the former providing a much greater degree of stability, and the latter mixing the quick response of the Bell system with the stability of the Hiller design. Some models use the simple Bell design, but this is limited mainly to scale models that are more challenging to fly, or models using advanced electronic stabilizing equipment. To reduce mechanical complexity and increase precision of the control of the [[swashplate]] some model helicopters use [[Cyclic/collective pitch mixing]]. ==Competition== Aerobatic helicopter flying has historically followed the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] rules, which for helicopters are labelled F3C. These include a predetermined routine of hovering and aerobatics. An advanced form of RC helicopter flying is called 3D. During [[3D flying]], helicopters perform advanced [[aerobatics]], sometimes in a freestyle form, or in a predetermined set of moves drawn up by the organisers of the competition. There are a number of 3D competitions around the world, two of the best known being the [[3D Masters]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the eXtreme Flight Championship (XFC) in the [[USA]]. ==Commercial applications== Although RC helicopters are generally used by hobbyists for recreational purposes, they are sometimes used in applications such as low altitude [[aerial photography]], filming, policing, and remote observation or inspection. Some companies make RC helicopters specifically for these uses. Recent (2006) FAA regulations grounding all commercial RC model flights have been upgraded to require formal FAA certification before permission to fly at any altitude in USA.

Either an X-ray machine or a radioactive source ([[Ir-192]], [[Co-60]], or in rare cases [[Cs-137]]) can be used as a source of photons. [[Neutron radiographic testing]] (NR) is a variant of radiographic testing which uses [[neutron]]s instead of photons to penetrate materials. This can see very different things from X-rays, because neutrons can pass with ease through lead and steel but are stopped by plastics, water and oils. Since the amount of radiation emerging from the opposite side of the material can be detected and measured, variations in this amount (or intensity) of radiation are used to determine thickness or composition of material. Penetrating radiations are those restricted to that part of the electromagnetic spectrum of wavelength less than about 10 [[nanometre]]s. == Inspection of welds == The beam of radiation must be directed to the middle of the section under examination and must be normal to the material surface at that point, except in special techniques where known defects are best revealed by a different alignment of the beam. The length of [[weld]] under examination for each exposure shall be such that the thickness of the material at the diagnostic extremities, measured in the direction of the incident beam, does not exceed the actual thickness at that point by more than 6%. The specimen to be inspected is placed between the source of radiation and the detecting device, usually the film in a light tight holder or cassette, and the radiation is allowed to penetrate the part for the required length of time to be adequately recorded. The result is a two-dimensional projection of the part onto the film, producing a latent image of varying densities according to the amount of [[radiation]] reaching each area. It is known as a radiograph, as distinct from a photograph produced by light. Because film is cumulative in its response (the exposure increasing as it absorbs more radiation), relatively weak radiation can be detected by prolonging the exposure until the film can record an image that will be visible after development. The radiograph is examined as a [[Negative (photography)|negative]], without printing as a positive as in photography. This is because, in printing, some of the detail is always lost and no useful purpose is served. Before commencing a radiographic examination, it is always advisable to examine the component with one's own eyes, to eliminate any possible external defects. If the surface of a weld is too irregular, it may be
