In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a [[function (mathematics)|function]] among a well-defined class that closely matches ("approximates") a target function in a task-specific way. One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions [[approximation theory]] is the branch of [[numerical analysis]] that investigates how certain known functions (for example, [[special function]]s) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, [[polynomial]]s or [[rational function]]s) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.). Second, the target function, call it ''g'', may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points of the form (''x'', ''g''(''x'')) is provided. Depending on the structure of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] and [[codomain]] of ''g'', several techniques for approximating ''g'' may be applicable. For example, if ''g'' is an operation on the [[real number]]s, techniques of [[interpolation]], [[extrapolation]], [[regression analysis]], and [[curve fitting]] can be used. If the codomain{{clarify|date=December 2010}} of ''g'' is a finite set, one is dealing with a [[statistical classification|classification]] problem instead. To some extent the different problems (regression, classification, [[fitness approximation]]) have received a unified treatment in [[statistical learning theory]], where they are viewed as [[supervised learning]] problems. ==See also== *[[Radial basis function network]] *[[Fitness approximation]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Function Approximation}} [[Category:Statistical models]] [[Category:Machine learning]] [[Category:Statistical approximations]] {{mathanalysis-stub}} {{statistics-stub}} [[hr:Aproksimacija funkcija]] [[sr:Апроксимација функција]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14375</id> <title>Functional data analysis</title> <text>'''Functional data analysis''' is a branch of [[statistics]] that analyzes data providing information about curves, surfaces or anything else varying over a continuum. The continuum is often time, but may also be spatial location, wavelength, probability and etc. The data may be so accurate that error can be ignored, may be subject to substantial [[measurement error]], or even have a complex indirect relationship to the curve that they define. For example, measurements of the heights of children over a wide range of ages have an error level so small as to be ignorable for many purposes, but daily records of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] at a [[weather station]] are so variable as to require careful and sophisticated analyses in order to extract something like a mean precipitation curve. However these curves are [[Estimation theory|estimated]], it is the assumption that they are intrinsically smooth that often defines a functional data analysis. In particular, functional data analyses often make use of the information in the slopes and curvatures of curves, as reflected in their derivatives. Plots of first and second derivatives as functions of t, or plots of second derivative values as functions of first derivative values, may reveal important aspects of the processes generating the data. As a consequence, curve estimation methods designed to yield good derivative estimates can play a critical role in functional data analysis. Models for functional data and methods for their analysis may resemble those for conventional multivariate data, including linear and nonlinear [[regression model]]s, [[principal components analysis]], and many others. But the possibility of using derivative information greatly extends the power of these methods, and also leads to purely functional models such as those defined by [[differential equation]]s, often called [[dynamical systems]]. ==See also== * [[Data analysis]] * [[Functional analysis]] == Further reading == * Ramsay, J.

This has led to a renaming of the theory to Functional Discourse Grammar (FDG). This type of grammar is quite distinct from [[systemic functional grammar]] as developed by [[Michael Halliday]] and many other linguists since the 1970s. The notion of "function" in FG generalizes
