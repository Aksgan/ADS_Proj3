non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered. === Many-sorted first-order logic === A generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one '''sort''' of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort. One example of many-sorted logic is for planar [[Euclidean geometry]]. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation ''E'' which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the [[Euclidean plane]], the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation ''E''(''p'',''l'') holds if and only if point ''p'' is on line ''l''. == Higher-order predicate logics == A formal language for [[higher-order logic|higher-order predicate logic]] looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc. All of these types of variables can be quantified. There are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. '''Full semantics''' require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. '''Henkin semantics''', which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain ''D'', a collection of subsets of ''D'', a collection of functions from ''D'' to ''D'', etc. The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic. == Non-classical interpretations == The interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of [[non-classical logic]] (such as [[intuitionistic logic]]), and in the study of modal logic. Interpretations used to study non-classical logic include [[topological model]]s, [[Boolean valued model]]s, and [[Kripke model]]s. [[Modal logic]] is also studied using Kripke models. == Intended interpretations == Many formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended be the set of natural numbers. However, there are always other''' unintended interpretations''' in which either the domain of discourse or the non-logical symbols are not given their intended meanings. In the context of [[Peano arithmetic]], the intended interpretation is called the '''standard model of arithmetic'''. It consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are [[isomorphic]] to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the [[Peano axioms]]. There are also [[Peano axioms#Nonstandard models|non-standard models of the Peano axioms]], which contain elements not correlated with any natural number. == Other concepts of interpretation == There are other uses of the term "interpretation" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages. In model theory, a structure ''A'' is said to interpret a structure ''B'' if there is a definable subset ''D'' of ''A'', and definable relations and functions on ''D'', such that ''B'' is isomorphic to the structure with domain ''D'' and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain ''D'' that is used, but rather ''D'' modulo an equivalence relation definable in ''A''. For additional information, see [[Interpretation (model theory)]]. A theory ''T'' is said to interpret another theory ''S'' if there is a finite [[extension by definition]]s ''T''&prime; of ''T'' such that ''S'' is contained in ''T''&prime;. == See also == *[[Herbrand interpretation]] *[[Interpretation (model theory)]] *[[Logical system]] *[[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]] *[[Modal logic]] *[[Model (abstract)]] *[[Model theory]] *[[Satisfiable]] == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/#4 Stanford Enc.
