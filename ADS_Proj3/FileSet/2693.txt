He was homosexual, as was at least one of his brothers, three of whom committed suicide, with Wittgenstein and the remaining brother contemplating it too. Those who knew him described him as tortured and domineering: [[Richard Rorty]] writes that he took out his intense self-loathing on everyone he met. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to pursue philosophy, and famously embraced the wife of philosopher [[G.E. Moore]] when he learned she was working in a jam factory—doing something useful, in Wittgenstein's eyes.<ref>For the list of others in Vienna at that time, see Duffy, Bruce.

The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the relationship between propositions and the world, and saw the aim of philosophy as correcting misconceptions about language through logical abstraction. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the conclusions of the ''Tractatus'', and provided a detailed account of the many possible uses of ordinary language, calling language a series of interchangeable [[language-game]]s in which the meaning of words is derived from their public use. Despite these differences, similarities between the early and later periods include a conception of philosophy as a kind of therapy, a concern for ethical and religious issues, and a literary style often described as poetic. [[Terry Eagleton]] called him the philosopher of poets and composers, playwrights and novelists.<ref>For ethical and religious themes, see Barrett, Cyril.
