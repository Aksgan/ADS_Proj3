The numbers displayed in parentheses next to each category indicate the number of placemarks belonging to that category. Basic functions also allow users to link to a corresponding [[Wikipedia]] article, add an address, or specify whether a polygon outlines a building (as opposed to a parcel of land). === Pictures === Users also can add up to seven pictures to each tag by selecting ''Add/Manage Photos'' from the placetag's menu. This opens a dialog box, allowing the user to upload a photo from their computer or the internet. === Languages === Location tagging is fully multi-lingual, meaning that there is no need to create separate tags for different languages. If a place is described in multiple languages, the user can navigate to other language pages by clicking on the link at the bottom of the window. Currently a total of 101 languages are supported, and 100% of the interface has been translated into 56 languages. Most of the languages (except Chinese) use [[ISO 639-1]] naming conventions.<ref name="ISOcode">{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/forum/?t=2823&goto=55070#goto55070|title=Wikimapia forum: ISO letters|publisher=wikimapia.org|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> Registered users can help translate the WikiMapia interface at a special page (http://wikimapia.org/translate/). ===Linear features=== Wikimapia also allows users to add "linear features", meaning roads, railroads, ferry lines, and rivers. The interface allows users to specify the size of the road (major highway, side street, dirt road, etc.), to indicate one-way streets, and to provide a brief description. It also allows users to describe intersections and tunnels. The railroad and ferry line interfaces are similar to the one used for roads. The river-marking tool is somewhat more complex, as there are secondary lines that can be used to define the river's shoreline. The roads feature is also used to populate a drop-down list of nearby street names in a tag's address box. === Wikimapia API === In December 2009 Wikimapia launched an [[API]] for non-commercial use.<ref>[http://blog.wikimapia.org/node/19]</ref> === Watchlists === WikiMapia also allows registered users to set up watchlists to monitor changes on certain areas of the map. Users can define the size and location of each watched region and save it under a unique name. ===WikiMapia forum=== In addition to the Messaging system, which runs from the map screen, WikiMapia also operates a forum, which was launched in October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikimapia.org/faq.htm |title= WikiMapia FAQ|accessdate = 2007-11-14|date = 2006-10-08}}</ref> Although a separate wiki User Guide exists, most of WikiMapia's policy discussions take place at the forum. ===User statistics=== There is a user statistics and ranking board which automatically ranks users based on their contributions. However, user statistics has no impact on a user's user-level. == User accounts and levels == Optional user accounts were introduced in October 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimapiablog.blogspot.com/2006/10/registration-started.html|title= Registration started|author = Koriakine, Alexandre|accessdate = 2007-11-14|date = 2006-10-08}}</ref> User levels and permissions have evolved over time in response to the need to control vandalism or abuse. As explained in the WikiMapia FAQ, there are three user-levels. *'''User Level 0 (UL0)''': Level 0 is the default user level assigned to all new users. UL0 are able to add places, edit existing places, and use the personal messaging system. New users are temporarily prevented from posting in the forum. *'''User Level 1 (UL1)''': Users are automatically upgraded to UL1 after a few days. In addition to the regular UL0 functions, UL1 users are able to change polygons (place outlines), add roads, add rivers, add railroads, delete places, and contribute to the forum. The vast majority of Wikimapia contributors fall into this category. *'''User Level 2 (UL2)''': A few hundred registered WikiMapia users have been granted Level 2 access. UL2 permissions include functions which are vital to maintaining site security (such as the ability to initiate ban proceedings on vandals) and anti-vandalism efforts on the map itself (such as the ability to delete a greater number of tags, to protect tags against editing by unregistered users, and to quick-delete certain tags). === UL2 status === UL2 status may be one of the most misunderstood aspects of WikiMapia's hierarchy, in part, because the process of promotion remains mysterious to most new users.<ref name="Forum_UL2_question">{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/forum/?t=1957&goto=34231|title=Forum Topic: Pitr|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref> Level 2 permissions are granted solely at the discretion of WikiMapia Administrators (or site owners), and have
