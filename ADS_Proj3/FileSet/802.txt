functionality when interacting with C++ code. This is because reflection cannot provide as much information about the code as it can for C# and VB.net ===J#=== [[J sharp|J#]] runs a distant fourth in terms of adoption. J# is a language primarily designed to ease the transition of Java applications to the .NET framework; it allows developers to leave much of their Java or J++ code unchanged while still running it in the .NET framework, thus allowing them to migrate small pieces of it into another .NET language, such as C#, individually. J# does not receive the same level of updates as the other languages, and does not have the same level of community support. For example, Visual Studio 2005 Team System supports automatic generation of Unit Tests in C#, VB.Net, and C++, but excludes J#. J# has been discontinued and is not included in Visual Studio 2008 or newer versions, since the existing J# feature set largely meets customer needs and usage of J# is declining. ===Additional .NET languages=== {{Main|List of CLI languages}} All .NET languages compile down to [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), which contains rich metadata and is functionally and logically equivalent to the original .NET language code. For these reasons, while it is possible to code directly in CIL, it is rarely done. The equivalency of CIL to .NET language code permits tools such as [[.NET Reflector]] to transform a .NET assembly into source code that is nearly identical to the original source. [[Obfuscated code|Code obfuscators]] are often used to guard against this, and operate by directly modifying the CIL of an assembly in order to make it difficult or impossible to de-compile to a higher level .NET language. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/czz35az4(v=VS.100).aspx Microsoft Visual Studio Language Equivalents 2003-2010] *[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/522xhsa3(vs.80).aspx Microsoft VSTO Programming with Visual Basic Versus C#] *[http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/vbnet_c__difference.asp CodeProject VB vs C#] *[http://www.harding.edu/USER/fmccown/WWW/vbnet_csharp_comparison.html Syntactical differences between C# and VB.NET] *[http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/convert/csharp-to-vb/ Free online C# to VB.NET code converter] *[http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/convert/vb-to-csharp/ Free online VB.NET to C# code converter] *[http://www.all4dotnet.com/convertcode.aspx Free online .Net code converter - VB.NET to/from C#] *[http://blog.gadodia.net/extension-methods-in-vbnet-and-c/ Extension Method Handling - C# vs VB.NET] {{DotNET}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Comparison Of C Sharp And Visual Basic .Net}} [[Category:Articles with example BASIC code]] [[Category:Articles with example C Sharp code]] [[Category:Programming language comparisons]] [[Category:.NET framework]] [[Category:BASIC programming language family]] [[fa:مقایسه سی‌شارپ و ویژوال بیسیک دات‌نت]] [[ko:비주얼 베이직 닷넷과 C 샤프의 비교]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7156</id> <title>Comparison of Microsoft Windows versions</title> <text>{| class="wikitable" align="right" style="font-size: 85%; text-align: center; margin-left: 1em" |- ! style="background-color:#BC8F8F;" | Desktop market share for November 2010<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-ww-monthly-201011-201012-bar | title = StatCounter Operating System Market Share | date = 2010-12-12}} Courtesy of StatCounter, a web analytics company which obtains its data from [http://gs.statcounter.com/faq#methodology an average of 15 billion hits per month, by people from all over the world onto their 3 million+ member sites].</ref> |- | style="background-color:#FFF8DC;" | '''Total Windows - 91.9%''' |- | style="background-color:#FFE4C4;" | [[Windows XP]] - 51.4% |- | style="background-color:#FFE4A5;" | [[Windows 7]] - 24.5% |- | style="background-color:#FFE4A5;" | [[Windows Vista]] - 16.0% |- | style="background-color:#FFE4C4;" | Non-Windows - 8.1% |- |} '''[[Microsoft Windows]]''' is the name of several families of computer software operating systems by [[Microsoft]].
