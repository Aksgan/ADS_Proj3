Software]]), invented the idea for Spy Sweeper. Behind the scenes, Kevin Thomas and Richard Koontz (Webroots ACE programmer) worked hard on developing Spy Sweeper, despite being at odds with the CEO at the time (David Moll). Richard, working from home on off hours, finished Spy Sweeper and the initial version was finally released in September 2004. At this time, neither Kevin Thomas or Richard Koontz have ever received credit for the invention of Spy Sweeper. In October 2006, Webroot released Spy Sweeper with [[AntiVirus]], which includes removal and protection of [[computer virus]]es . The anti-virus component is based on an anti-virus product made by the software vendor [[Sophos]]. In June 2007 version 5.5 was released, which included the ability to scan [[email attachment]]s, and an improved [[user interface]]. W2000 users cannot upgrade from V5.5. In October 2008 version 6.0 was released. The product has won many awards in the press <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webroot.com/En_US/about-press-room-reviews-and-awards-awards-spysweeper.html| title=Spy Sweeper Awards| publisher=Spy Sweeper's official site| accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref>, and was the first [[anti-spyware]] product to receive "Checkmark" certification from the testing company [http://www.westcoastlabs.com/checkmark/ West Coast Labs] <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.westcoastlabs.com/checkmark/productList/?vendorID=46| title=Webroot Named First Recipient of Anti-Spyware Checkmark Certification in New Testing Category| publisher=Spy Sweeper's official site| date=2006-02-14| accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref>.

Spyce is [[free software]], distributed under a [[BSD-style licence]], with some additional restrictions about documentation notices<ref>[http://spyce.sourceforge.net/docs/license.html Spyce - Python Server Pages (PSP)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. ==Common Spyce Embedding Methods== Since Python uses indentation to determine the beginning and end of a block, Spyce includes several ways to embed Python [[source code|code]]. Shown below are the three most common ways. Spyce supports [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]/[[JavaServer Pages|JSP]]-style [[delimiter]]s ('''<%''' and '''%>''') as well as double braces (''"'' and ''"'') 1. Python 'chunks' (multiple Python statements with traditional [[indentation]]): <pre> It's <b>[[\ from time import asctime, localtime print asctime(localtime()) ]]</b> right now! </pre> or <pre> It's <b><%\ from time import asctime, localtime print asctime(localtime()) %></b> right now! </pre> 2. Individual statements within delimiters (indentation not required): [[for x in xrange(3): { ]] <nowiki><b>Hello, </b></nowiki> [[} ]] or <% for x in xrange(3): { %> <nowiki><b>Hello, </b></nowiki> <% } %> 3. Expressions evaluation <nowiki><b>I am [[= 5*3 ]] years old.</b></nowiki> or <nowiki><b>I am <%= 5*3 %> years old.</b></nowiki> The techniques above can be freely mixed and embedded in any [[HTML]] document. Any legal Python code can be embedded and any Python module can be imported, which makes it especially suited for writing very robust applications (using [[exception handling]] and [[unit test]]ing single modules individually). ==Features== Some other features include custom tags (ala JSP), spyce [[lambda function|lambda]]s and [[active handler]]s (reminiscent of ASP). ==Requirements== Spyce brings Python's standard library and the programming language itself to the web. The minimum requirement is a working Python installation (it ships with a standalone web server written in Python that can be used during development), although it can be used in conjunction with several web servers such as Apache and IIS in a variety of ways. Configuration is done using Python modules that are imported by the web server during initialization, so all that is really required to get started with Spyce is basic knowledge of Python. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[mod_python]] * [http://www.neotitans.com/resources/python/spyce-tips-and-techniques.html Spyce Tips and Techniques] {{Application frameworks}} ==References== <references /> ==External links== * [http://spyce.sourceforge.net/ http://spyce.sourceforge.net/] (Official website) * [http://www.neotitans.com/resources/python/spyce-tips-and-techniques.html Spyce tips and techniques] [[Category:Free computer programming tools]] [[Category:Python programming language]] {{compu-lang-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>35445</id> <title>Spykee</title> <text>'''Spykee''' is a robotic toy made by [[Erector]]/[[Meccano]]. It contains a [[USB]] [[webcam]], microphone and speakers. Controlled by computer locally or over the internet, the owner can move the robot to various locations within range of the local router, take pictures and video, listen to surroundings with the on-board microphone and play sounds/music or various built-in recordings (Robot laugh, laser guns, etc.) through the speaker. Spykee has a WiFi connectivity to let him access the Internet using both ad-hoc and infrastructure modes. The electronics inside Spykee were built by a French start-up called [http://wave-storm.com/ WaveStorm]. == Introduction == The Spykee robot was conceived in 2006 http://www.spykeeworld.com/spykee/US/index.html and began shipping in the United States in late 2008. == Assembly == Spykee is marketed for children ages 8 and up and claims to require 1.5 hours installation time. A review of Amazon.com product reviews indicates the actual assembly time is longer. == Modifications == Spykee is compatible with other Meccano set parts. At least one owner has modified Spykee to be able to move its "head" (and thus its webcam) up and down. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN_9rkovW6s Advertised as an open-source robot, it is unfortunate that no [[API]] or [[SDK]] has been officially released. However, http://spykee.duskofsolace.com is an unofficial wiki containing information on how to access Linux on Spykee. There is information on how the hardware works and there are new unofficial firmwares, that mainly addresses issues on accessing linux and have the capability of mounting network or usb partitions in linux. As of May 2010 (possibly earlier), the full source code for the robot firmware, as well as documentation, has been made available, see: http://www.spykeeworld.com/spykee/US/freeSoftware.html A home made robot daemon open source project (named Phobos Daemon) is available on spykeewiki as well. The aftermarket daemon supports all the basic functionality of Spykee and has additional features. As of october 2010 exists an application to control this robot from an Android Smartphone. http://www.aspykee.com == On-lines Reviews == http://www.robotreviews.com/reviews/spykee-spy-robot-review http://tech.spotcoolstuff.com/gadget/review-erector-spykee-spy-robot [[Category:Entertainment robots]] [[Category:Toys of the 2000s]] [[cs:Spykee]] [[fr:Meccano Spykee]] [[no:Meccano spykee]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35446</id> <title>Spynot</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Merge|Anonymous proxy|date=August 2009}} '''SpyNOT''' is a [[World Wide Web]]-based anonymous [[Proxy server|proxy]], developed by Glyde Internet, that allows a user to [[Internet privacy#Surf anonymously|surf the Web anonymously]].
