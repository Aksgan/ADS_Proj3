More popular midrange equipment includes cardstock, a [[laminate]]d [[particle board]], or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass. More expensive traditional materials are still used by many players. The most expensive Go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells. ===Traditional equipment=== ====Boards==== The [[Go equipment#Board|Go board]] (generally referred to by its Japanese name ''goban'') typically measures between {{convert|45|and|48|cm|abbr=on}} in length (from one player's side to the other) and {{convert|42|to|44|cm|abbr=on}} in width. Chinese boards are slightly larger, as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match. The board is not square; there is a 15:14 ratio in length to width, because with a perfectly square board, from the player's viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board. The added length compensates for this.<ref name="EquipSize">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 142–143</ref> There are two main types of boards: a table board similar in most respects to other game boards like that used for chess, and a floor board, which is its own free-standing table and at which the players sit. The traditional Japanese ''goban'' is between {{convert|10|and|18|cm|abbr=on}} thick and has legs; it sits on the floor (see picture to right).<ref name="EquipSize"/> It is preferably made from the rare golden-tinged [[Torreya nucifera|Kaya]] tree (''Torreya nucifera''), with the very best made from Kaya trees up to 700 years old. More recently, the related [[Torreya californica|California Torreya]] (''Torreya californica'') has been prized for its light color and pale rings, as well as its less expensive and more readily available stock. The natural resources of Japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slow-growing Kaya trees; both ''T. nucifera'' and ''T. californica'' take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size, and they are now extremely rare, raising the price of such equipment tremendously.<ref name="EquipWood"/> As Kaya trees are a protected species in Japan, they cannot be harvested until they have died. Thus, an old-growth, floor-standing Kaya ''goban'' can easily cost in excess of US$10,000 with the highest-quality examples costing more than $60,000.<ref name=kayaprice>{{citation | url=http://www.kiseido.com/clearance.htm | title = Kiseido clearance sale}} lists the regular price for a Shihomasa Kaya Go Board with legs ({{convert|20.4|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}} thick) as $60,000+</ref> Other, less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both Chinese and Japanese dimensions include [[Thujopsis|Hiba]] (''Thujopsis dolabrata''), [[Katsura tree|Katsura]] (''Cercidiphyllum japonicum''), [[Agathis|Kauri]] (''Agathis''), and Shin Kaya (various varieties of [[spruce]], commonly from Alaska, Siberia and China's [[Yunnan Province]]).<ref name="EquipWood">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 143–149</ref> So-called ''Shin Kaya'' is a potentially confusing merchant's term: ''shin'' means "new", and thus ''shin kaya'' is best translated "faux kaya", because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to Kaya.<ref name="EquipWood"/> ====Stones==== A full set of Go stones (''goishi'') usually contains 181 black stones and 180 white ones; a 19×19 grid has 361 points, so there are enough stones to cover the board, and Black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first. Traditional Japanese stones are double-convex, and made of [[clam]]shell (white) and [[slate]] (black).<ref name="EquipStones">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 150–153</ref> The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in [[Wakayama Prefecture]] and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam; however, due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of this clam, the stones are most often made of shells harvested from [[Mexico]].<ref name="EquipStones"/> Historically, the most prized stones were made of [[jade]], often given to the reigning emperor as a gift.<ref name="EquipStones"/> In China, the game is traditionally played with single-convex stones<ref name="EquipStones"/> made of a composite called [[Yunzi]]. The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by [[sintering]] a proprietary and trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds. This process dates to the Tang Dynasty and, after the knowledge was lost in the 1920s during the [[Chinese Civil War]], was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state-run Yunzi company. The material is praised for its colors, its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as [[melamine]], and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate/shell. The term "yunzi" can also refer to a single-convex stone made of any material; however, most English-language Go suppliers will specify Yunzi as a material and single-convex as a shape to avoid confusion, as stones made
