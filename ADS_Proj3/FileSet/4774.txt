made within a given time frame.<ref>{{harv|Ebersbach|2008|p=20}}</ref> Some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts ("[[Internet bot|bots]]").<ref>{{harv|Ebersbach|2008|p=54}}</ref> From the change log, other functions are accessible in most wikis: the [[Changelog|revision history]] shows previous page versions and the [[diff]] feature highlights the changes between two revisions. Using the revision history, an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article. The diff feature can be used to decide whether or not this is necessary. A regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the "Recent Changes" page and, if it is an unacceptable edit, consult the history, restoring a previous revision; this process is more or less streamlined, depending on the wiki software used.<ref>{{harv|Ebersbach|2008|p=178}}</ref> In case unacceptable edits are missed on the "recent changes" page, some wiki engines provide additional content control. It can be monitored to ensure that a page, or a set of pages, keeps its quality. A person willing to maintain pages will be warned of modifications to the pages, allowing him or her to verify the validity of new editions quickly.<ref>{{harv|Ebersbach|2008|p=109}}</ref> A watchlist is a common implementation of this. Some wikis also implement "patrolled revisions," in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark some edits as not vandalism. A "flagged revisions" system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed.<ref>{{citation|title=Wikipedia's Labor Squeeze and its Consequences|publisher=Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law|author=Goldman, Eric|volume=8}}</ref> ===Searching=== Most wikis offer at least a title [[search algorithm|search]], and sometimes a [[Full text search|full-text search]]. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as [[PmWiki]], use [[flat file]]s.<ref name=Augar>{{citation|title=Teaching and learning online with wikis|author=Naomi Augar, Ruth Raitman and Wanlei Zhou|publisher=Beyond the comfort zone|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.133.1456&rep=rep1&type=pdf|year=2004}}</ref> MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]] in the early 2000s to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external [[Web search engine|search engines]] such as [[Google Search]] can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions in order to obtain more precise results. However, a search engine's indexes can be very out of date (days, weeks or months) for many websites. ===Trustworthiness=== Critics of publicly editable wiki systems argue that these systems could be easily tampered with, while proponents argue that the community of users can catch malicious content and correct it.<ref name="Britannica"/> Lars Aronsson, a data systems specialist, summarizes the controversy as follows: {{quote|Most people, when they first learn about the wiki concept, assume that a Web site that can be edited by anybody would soon be rendered useless by destructive input. It sounds like offering free spray cans next to a grey concrete wall. The only likely outcome would be ugly graffiti and simple tagging, and many artistic efforts would not be long lived. Still, it seems to work very well.<ref name="ebersbach10"/>|}} High editorial standards in medicine have led to the idea of expert-moderated wikis.<ref>{{citation|title=Introducing Web 2.0: wikis for health librarians|author=Barsky, Eugene; Giustini, Dean|date= 2007-12|publisher=Journal of the Canadian Health Libraries Association|url=https://dspace.library.ubc.ca/handle/2429/497}}</ref> Some wikis allow one to link to specific versions of articles, which has been useful to the scientific community, in that expert peer reviewers could analyse articles, improve them and provide links to the trusted version of that article.<ref>{{citation|title=Wiki ware could harness the Internet for science|author=Kevin Yager|publisher=Nature|date=16 March 2006|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7082/full/440278a.html}}</ref> Noveck points out that "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation." On controversial topics that have been subject to disruptive editing, a wiki may restrict editing to registered users.<ref name=Noveck/> ===Security=== The open philosophy of most wikis, allowing anyone to edit content, does not ensure that every editor is well-meaning. Vandalism can be a major problem. In larger wiki sites, such as those run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], [[vandalism]] can go unnoticed for a period of time. Wikis by their very nature are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as "[[troll (Internet)|trolling]]". Wikis tend to take a ''[[soft security]]''<ref name="soft security">{{Citation|url=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity |title=Soft Security|accessdate=2007-03-09|publisher=[[UseModWiki]]|date=2006-09-20 }}</ref> approach to the problem of vandalism; making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage. Larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism and JavaScript enhancements that show characters that have been added in each edit. In this way vandalism can be limited to just "minor vandalism" or "sneaky vandalism", where the characters added/eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and users do not pay much attention to them. The amount of vandalism a wiki receives depends on how open the wiki is. For instance, some wikis allow unregistered users, identified by their [[IP address]]es, to edit content, whilst others limit this function to just registered users. Most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account,<ref>{{harv|Ebersbach|2008|p=108}}</ref> but give registered users additional editing functions; on most wikis, becoming a registered user is a short and simple process. Some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools. For example, on the [[English Wikipedia]], registered users can only rename pages if their account is at least four days old. Other wikis such as the [[Portuguese Wikipedia]] use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement, granting extra tools after the user has made a certain number of edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor. Basically, "closed up" wikis are more secure and reliable but grow slowly, whilst more open wikis grow at a steady rate but result in being an easy target for vandalism. A clear example of this would be that of Wikipedia and [[Citizendium]]. The first is extremely open, allowing anyone with a computer and internet access to edit it, making it grow rapidly, whilst the latter requires the users' real name and a [[biography]] of themselves, affecting the growth of the wiki but creating an almost "vandalism-free" ambiance.
