Hard drives with S.M.A.R.T.-reported average temperatures below 27 °C (80.6 °F) had higher failure rates than hard drives with the highest reported average temperature of 50 °C (122 °F), failure rates at least twice as high as the optimum S.M.A.R.T.-reported temperature range of 36 °C (96.8 °F) to 47 °C (116.6 °F).<ref name=google/> [[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]], [[Serial attached SCSI|SAS]], and [[Fibre Channel|FC]] drives are typically more expensive and are traditionally used in [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[disk array]]s, whereas inexpensive ATA and SATA drives evolved in the [[home computer]] market and were perceived to be less reliable. This distinction is now becoming blurred. The [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF) of SATA drives is usually about 600,000 hours (some drives such as [[Western Digital Raptor]] have rated 1.4 million hours MTBF),<ref>[http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-701284.pdf WD VelociRaptor Drive Specification Sheet (PDF)]</ref> while SCSI drives are rated for upwards of 1.5 million hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} However, independent research indicates that MTBF is not a reliable estimate of a drive's longevity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storagemojo.com/?p=383|title=Everything You Know About Disks Is Wrong|publisher=StorageMojo|date=February 20, 2007|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> MTBF is conducted in laboratory environments in test chambers and is an important metric to determine the quality of a disk drive before it enters high volume production.
