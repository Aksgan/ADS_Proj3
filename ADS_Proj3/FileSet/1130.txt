presented evidence to the [[Health Select Committee]] at the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on the challenges faced by the profession. The DLA was instrumental in setting up the Dental Technicians Education and Training Advisory Board (DTETAB), which is now known as the [[Dental Technologists Association]] (DTA). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the emergence of the [[Medical Devices Directive]] and the introduction of Quality Systems to the industry. The DLA worked to establish an industry-led standard and the first example of this was a system based on BS 5750 called the Certification Authority for Dental Laboratories and Suppliers (CADLAS), which is still operating as AMTAC MEDICA and is now audited to ISO9002. With the lessons learned in setting up CADLAS, a new system called the Dental Appliance Manufacturers Audit Scheme (DAMAS) was launched in 1998. This is based around ISO 9000 and also addresses the Medical Devices Regulations (MDR). By now the Association membership had risen to over 900 and the association moved into new offices at Arboretum Gate in February 1997. There have been many changes since 2000, including the retirement of Bill Courtney and appointment of Richard Daniels as Chief Executive. Membership has passed the 1,000 mark, and the DLA is building a profile as a campaigning organisation with appearances across the media. == Offices == In May 2001 the Association moved to their current offices on Wollaton Road, [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] in [[Nottingham]]. == Logo == The DLA logo is circular in shape with the initials "DLA" in the middle. == Current activities == The DLA's current projects include: *DAMAS *Occupational standards for technicians *Training trainers (lab owners) *Business advice systems *Business seminars *Health & safety advice *Employment advice *Materials non-conformance reporting *British Standards (including sports mouthguards) *Statutory Registration of technicians *Lobbying for ringfenced fees for NHS work *Running conferences, exhibitions and seminars *Regional meetings and roadshows *European affairs concerning laboratories *IDEA - Inspiring Dental Education & Advice The DLA is a member of the [[British Dental Health Foundation]] (BDHF), the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] (RoSPA) and the Federation of European Dental Laboratory Owners (FEPPD). ==Events== ===Dental Technology Show=== Dental Technology Show (DTS) at the [[Ricoh Arena]] in [[Coventry]] on 9 - 10 May 2008. ===Orthodontic Technicians Association Conference=== In recent years the association has built links with the [[Orthodontic Technicians Association]] (OTA) and the DLA is represented at the OTA annual conference. == Council == The DLA Council is the governing body of the association and is elected by the members.

The "War Office Seal" was created in 1778 and the Emblem was developed out of the seal and approved in 1974. ==History== The Army Seal was used originally during the American Revolution to authenticate documents. It displayed the designation "War Office," which was synonymous with Headquarters of the Army, and the Roman date MDCCLXXVIII (1778) the first time it was used. It remained unchanged until 1974, when the War Office banner was replaced with "Department of the Army" and the date was changed to 1775, the year in which the Army was established. The seal embodies the Army's ideals of loyalty, vigilance, perseverance, truth, courage, zeal, fortitude, remembrance, determination, constancy, achievement, dignity, and honor. The changes were legislated by the [[National Security Act of 1947]], and authorized by Section 3011, [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10, United States Code]]. Prior to the establishment of the "Department of the Army Emblem," there was no official display item to identify the Army. The Seal had traditionally been used to authenticate documents only and was not authorized for public display. In recognizing the need to provide a display item, The [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] approved the emblem design as the official emblem to represent the Army on January 29th, 1974. ==Description== [[Image:Seal of the US Department of the Army.svg|thumb|350px|right|The '''Department of the Army Emblem''']] The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|Army Institute of Heraldry]] describes the War Office Seal as follows: :In the center is a Roman [[cuirass]] below a vertical unsheathed sword, point up, the [[pommel]] resting on the neck opening of the cuirass and a [[Phrygian cap]] supported on the sword
