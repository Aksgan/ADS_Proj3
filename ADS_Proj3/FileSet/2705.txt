then to Oxford to see [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into "Storey's End," at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he was scared of dying in hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan was at first afraid of him, but they became very close.<ref name=archivefinalyears>[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre11.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Final Years"], Cambridge Wittgenstein archive, accessed 8 September 2010. *Also see Malcolm, Norman. ''A Memoir''. Oxford University Press, p. 79ff.</ref> By the beginning of 1951 it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Normal Malcolm that month to say, "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once & and that mental life can cease before the rest does."<ref>Malcolm, Norman. ''A Memoir''. Oxford University Press, p. 79ff.</ref> In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other manuscripts were later published as ''[[Remarks on Colour]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]''.<ref name=archivefinalyears/> He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April, 13 days before his death: "An extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been ''absolutely'' certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up.&mdash;Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks & it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now."<ref name=Malcolm80>Malcolm, Norman. ''A Memoir''. Oxford University Press, pp. 80–81.</ref> He began work on his final manuscript, MS 177, on 25 April 1951; the last entry was on 27 April: [[File:Wittgenstein Gravestone.jpg|thumb|200px|Wittgenstein's grave at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]] ]] <blockquote>If someone believes that he has flown from America to England in the last few days, then, I believe, he cannot be making a mistake.<p> And just the same if someone says that he is at this moment sitting at a table and writing.<p> But even if in such cases I can’t be mistaken, isn't it possible that I am drugged? If I am and if the drug has taken away my consciousness, then I am not now really talking and thinking. I cannot seriously suppose that I am at this moment dreaming. Someone who, dreaming, says "I am dreaming," even if he speaks audibly in doing so, is no more right than if he said in his dream "it is raining," while it was in fact raining. Even if his dream were actually connected with the noise of the rain.<ref name=archivefinalyears/></blockquote> It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and became very ill that evening; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, "Good!". Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life." Norman Malcolm writes that this was a strangely moving utterance, given how unhappy his life seems to have been.<ref name=Malcolm80/> Four of his former students arrived at his bedside&mdash;Ben Richards, Elizabeth Anscombe, Yorick Smythies, and Maurice O'Connor Drury. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics, and at the latter's request, a Dominican monk, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. He was given a Catholic burial at [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|St. Giles's Church]], Cambridge. Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do.<ref name=Monk576>Monk, pp. 576–580.</ref> ==1953: Publication of the ''Philosophical Investigations''== {{Main|Philosophical Investigations|Language-game|Private language argument}} [[File:Duckrabbit.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration of a "duckrabbit," discussed in the ''Philosophical Investigations'', section XI, part II]] The ''[[Blue and Brown Books|Blue Book]]'', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contains seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language, and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language. The ''Philosophical Investigations'' was published in two parts in 1953. Most of the 693 numbered paragraphs in Part I were ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called "language gone on holiday."<ref>PI, §23.</ref> Philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. Wittgenstein describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language&mdash;the language of the ''Tractatus''&mdash;where all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.<ref>PI, §107.</ref> Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the "rough ground" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved:
