MOD files use the “.MOD” [[file extension]], except on the [[Amiga]] where the original trackers instead use a “mod.” prefix scheme, e.g. “mod.echoing”{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. A MOD file contains a set of ''instruments'' in the form of [[sampling (music)|sample]]s, a number of ''patterns'' indicating how and when the samples are to be played, and a list of what patterns to play in what order. == History == The first version of the format was created by Karsten Obarski for use in the [[Ultimate Soundtracker]]; [[tracker (music software)|tracker]] software released for the [[Amiga]] computer in 1987[http://www.soundtracker.org/]. The format has since been supported by hundreds of [[List of Amiga music format players|playback programs]] and dozens of [[List of audio trackers|other trackers]]. The original version of the MOD format featured four channels of simultaneous audio playback, corresponding to the capabilities of the [[original Amiga chipset#Paula|original Amiga chipset]], and up to 15 instruments. Later variations of the format have extended this to up to 32 channels and 31 instruments. The format was designed to be directly playable on the Amiga without additional processing: for example, samples are stored in 8-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] format ready to be played on the Amiga [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]], and pattern data is not packed. Playback required very little [[CPU]] time on an Amiga, and many games used MOD files for their [[video game music|background music]]. A common misconception is that the [[magic number (programming)|magic number]] "M.K." in the 0x438 offset of MOD files are the initials of Mahoney and Kaktus, two prominent Amiga demosceners at the time, who played an important part in the popularity of the format. They in fact stand for the initials of [[Michael Kleps]] a.k.a. Unknown / DOC, another important developer of the format.<ref>[http://io.debian.net/~tar/debian/xmp/xmp-2.7.1/docs/formats/Ultimate_Soundtracker-format.txt Ultimate Soundtracker module format description], by Michael Schwendt, 1997; distributed in the source of the [http://packages.debian.org/stable/xmp xmp] module player; published at io.debian.net</ref> {{demoscene}} After the Amiga's production ceased, the MOD format has had continued popularity in the [[Demoscene]] and as background music for [[independent video games]] and [[Chiptune]]s. It is not uncommon to hear MOD music in [[keygen]]s as well. == Format overview == A pattern is typically represented in a sequencer [[user interface]] as a table with one column per channel, thus having 4 columns; one for each Amiga hardware channel. Each column has 64 rows. A cell in the table can cause something to happen on its column's channel when its row's time is reached: * Start an instrument playing a new note in this channel at a given volume, possibly with a special effect applied on it * Change the volume or special effect being applied to the current note * Change pattern flow; jump to a specific song or pattern position or loop inside a pattern * Do nothing; any existing note playing in this channel will continue to play An instrument is a single sample along with an optional indication of which portion of the sample can be repeated to hold a sustained note. == Timing == In the original MOD file the minimum time frame was 0.02 seconds, or a "[[vertical synchronization|vertical blanking]]" (VSync) interval, because the original software used the VSync timing of the monitor running at 50 Hz (for [[PAL]]) or 60 Hz (for [[NTSC]]) for timing. The rate at which pattern data is played is defined by a ''speed setting''. Each row in the pattern data lasts one vertical blanking (or 0.02 seconds) times the current speed setting. The speed setting varied from 1 to 255. In later versions of the format, the vertical blanking was replaced with an adjustable time period staying in the range [0.01, 0.078] seconds. The old speed setting command was replaced with a new one that was used to change both the old speed setting and the new adjustable time period. Unfortunately, some of the old functionality was broken, because the new speed setting command had an identical code value to the old command. Values in the range [1, 31] were interpreted as the old speed settings, but other values were regarded as modifications to the adjustable time period. Hence, values in the range [32, 255] used in some old songs broke in new versions of the player.
