in part: "No party shall sell or distribute in interstate commerce a Covered [[Demodulator]] Product that does not comply with the Demodulator Compliance Requirements and Demodulator Robustness Requirements." According to the rule, hardware must "actively thwart" piracy. The rule's Demodulator Compliance Requirements insists that all HDTV demodulators must "listen" for the flag (or assume it to be present in all signals). Flagged content must be output only to "protected outputs" (such as [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] and [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] ports with [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] encryption), or in degraded form through [[analog (signal)|analog]] outputs or [[digital]] outputs with visual resolution of 720x480 pixels ([[Enhanced-definition television|EDTV]]) or less. Flagged content may be recorded only by "authorized" methods, which may include tethering of recordings to a single device. Since broadcast flags could be activated at any time, a viewer who often records a program might suddenly find that it is no longer possible to save their favorite show. This and other reasons lead many to see the flags as a direct affront to [[consumer rights]]. Particularly troubling to [[open source]] developers are the Demodulator Robustness Requirements. Devices must be "robust" against user access or modifications so that someone could not easily alter it to ignore the broadcast flags that permit access to the full digital stream. Since open-source [[device driver]]s are by design user-modifiable, a PC [[TV tuner card]] with open-source drivers would not be "robust", not if we assume that a majority of users has the expertise required to modify the driver's source code, create a functioning build environment, and compile and install the modified driver. It is unclear whether binary-only drivers would qualify. Since any binary driver can be decompiled and recompiled using publicly available software such as [[Interactive Disassembler|IDA]], if binary drivers were held to the same theoretical stance as open source drivers are above, they would probably not qualify. Projects could also be affected at the application level. In theory it would likely be illegal for open-source projects such as the [[MythTV]] project, which creates [[personal video recorder]] (PVR) software, to interface with digital television demodulators. Some companies currently manufacturing devices, such as the pcHDTV devices intended for the [[Linux]] market, would likely be forced to halt production. This portion of the rule also effectively prevents individuals from building their own high-definition television sets and receiving devices. (It may seem far-fetched to a layman, but there have been many instances in the past where engineers have built their own analog TVs, and it follows that some people would wish to continue such pursuits in the digital age. The technologies used will most likely be centered around [[software-defined radio]], fast [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADCs]] and [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] chips - tools with so generic use their availability can not be effectively restricted.) The [[GNU Radio]] project already successfully demonstrated that purely software-based demodulators can exist and the hardware rule is not fully enforceable. == Current status == In [[American Library Association v. FCC]], 406 F.3d 689 (D.C. Cir. 2005)<ref>http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200505/04-1037b.pdf</ref>, the [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]] ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority in creating this rule. The court stated that the Commission could not prohibit the manufacture of [[computer]] or video hardware without copy protection technology because the FCC only has authority to regulate transmissions, not devices that receive communications. While it is always possible that the Supreme Court could overturn this holding, the more likely reemergence of the broadcast flag is in legislation of the [[United States Congress]] granting such authority to the FCC. On May 1, 2006, Sen. [[Ted Stevens]] inserted a version of the Broadcast Flag into the Communications, Consumer’s Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stevens, Ted|authorlink=Ted Stevens|title=Communications, Consumer’s Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006|url=http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/06telcom.pdf|date=2006-05-01|accessdate=2006-07-07|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> On June 22, 2006 Sen. [[John E. Sununu]] offered an amendment to strike the broadcast and radio flag,<ref name=bill4>[http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/475 Sen.John E. Sununu amendment]</ref> but this failed and the broadcast-flag amendment was approved by the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce committee]]. Nonetheless, the overall bill was never passed, and thus died upon adjournment of the 109th Congress in December 2006. On May 18, 2008, [[News.com]] reported that [[Microsoft]] had confirmed that current versions of [[Windows Media Center]] shipping with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] family of operating systems adhered to the use of the broadcast flag, following reports of users being blocked from taping specific airings of [[NBC]] programs, mainly [[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|American Gladiators]] and [[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]. A Microsoft spokeperson said that Windows Media Center adheres to the "rules set forth by the FCC", even though no legislation actually requires following such rules.<ref name=wmc1>[http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9946780-7.html?tag=nefd.riv Microsoft confirms Windows adheres to broadcast flag]</ref> == Related broadcast flag technologies == === Radio broadcast flag and RIAA === With the coming of digital radio, the recording industry is attempting to change the ground rules for copyright of songs played on radio. Currently, over the air (i.e. broadcast but not Internet) radio stations may play songs freely but [[RIAA]] wants Congress to insert a radio broadcast flag. On April 26, 2006, Congress held a hearing over the radio broadcast flag. Among the witnesses were musicians [[Anita Baker]] and [[Todd Rundgren]]. === European Broadcast Flag === At present there is no equivalent signal defined in the European [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] standards. However, there have been recent moves in the DVB to define such a flag for use on clear-to-air television broadcasts. While this will probably include a "do not redistribute" bit similar to the American approach, a modified ATSC ''Broadcast Flag'' data stature will probably not be used by the Europeans, as the ATSC structure probably cannot be extended to meet their needs. European public service broadcasters are more likely to push for additional signals to indicate that content should ''not'' be encrypted in receiver devices, and that such receivers should also ''ignore'' any revocations while playing the specific content item.
