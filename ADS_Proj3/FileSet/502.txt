Schenck</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}} '''Bradley W. Schenck''' is an [[United States|American]] [[artist]] and [[game designer]]. Schenck's art is widely recognized for its strong themes and rigorous structure applied to [[fantastic]] subjects that is reminiscent of the work of members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. His work has been strongly influenced by traditional [[Celtic art]] and the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Nonetheless, while his style contains elements and motifs from these styles, Schenck has developed a style which includes a wide range of elements from art both classic and modern which he executes with his own strong sense of line and space. ==Early work== Schenck began his work as an artist at an early age, as a result of moving out of his parents home to live on his own at the age of 14. He had a strong network of friends that assisted him through his connections in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] and the role playing game community. He also had a strong work ethic and was stubbornly self-reliant. Some of Schenck's earliest published work can be found in the [[Arduin]] role playing game book ''Welcome to Skull Tower''. Schenck's early work can often be identified by his artist's signature "Morno" or the sigil of the moon with an inscribed letter 'M.' All of the art in this volume was produced by Schenck except for a couple of pieces produced by [[Erol Otus]]. Schenck's work also appeared in other role playing game publications of the day. His early work displays Schenck's strong sense of scene composition, dramatic shading, and effective use of line weight. However, at this point there is still some uncertainty in his execution of form. This changed rapidly, however, as the work presented in ''The Runestaff'' and various publications of the Society for Creative Anachronism in the early 1980s attests. His control over form, particularly of people, had improved dramatically. During this time his command of further detail in his work grew with each piece produced. For example, with one piece he became unsatisfied with an idealized presentation of the [[moon]]. He reworked the piece after researching the actual appearance of the moon in different phases to present the moon in the piece with a realistic appearance which also bore the stamp of his personal style. During this time his artist signature changed to his monogram: 'BWS'. Much of his work during this time was sold at science fiction conventions and private auctions. Among the most popular of his pieces were watercolors of line art originals. During this time, his pieces often presented moody scenes of stylized Celts in dramatic landscapes, as opposed to his earlier compositions of fairly conventionalized high fantasy motifs. The character expressed in his human forms also became deeper and more expressive, evoking a strong sense of the artist's emotion. ==Introduction to computers== Schenck is widely known for his computer art. His introduction to computers was through a [[Commodore VIC-20]] computer in 1982. While the graphics of this system were far too crude for Schenck to consider using it as a tool of visual art, Schenck still managed to express himself artistically through it. Using the [[BASIC]] programming language, Schenck first entered, then debugged a computer role playing game. Once it was functional, Schenck added additional characters and events to the game expressive of his personal style of irreverence. A poison gas trap from the original game was replaced with flatulent rats, and a conventional wizard character was replaced with Bufo, a wizard with a malevolent attitude and magical abilities that were frequently ineffective. The game was further modified and renamed as Ratquest later. Schenck's modifications were retained and embellished by both Schenck and others, and the game went on to be implemented on a range of different systems including the [[HP 2100]], [[HP 3000]], [[CP/M]], [[Commodore 64]],
