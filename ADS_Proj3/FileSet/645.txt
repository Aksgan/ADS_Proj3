changes between releases, not between the commits). Some [[project maintainer]]s will append a ''.txt'' suffix to the file name. Some [[revision control]] systems are able to generate the relevant information that is suited as a changelog. ==Format== Changelog files are organized by paragraphs, which define a unique change within a function or file. Most changelog files follow the following format: <pre> YYYY-MM-DD John Doe <johndoe@example.com> * myfile.ext (myfunction): my changes made additional changes * myfile.ext (unrelated_change): my changes made to myfile.ext but completely unrelated to the above * anotherfile.ext (somefunction): more changes </pre> Note that between the date and the name, and again between the name and the email address, there are two spaces each. It is common to enclose the email address in < and >. The [[Emacs | Emacs Editor]] creates such entries when creating additional changelog entries. ==Changelogs in Wikis== Most [[Wiki]] software includes ''changelogs'' as a fundamental feature (often called ''history'' in this context). For example, the "history" link at the top of a [[Wikipedia]] entry links to that page's changelog. This feature is vital for complying with the attribution requirements of some copyright licenses. ==Notes== {{reflist}} ==See also== *[[Release notes]] ==External links== * [http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/changelogs/guile-changelogs_3.html Explanations, how to write Changelog entries in open source projects] * [http://www.asp-shareware.org/pad PAD], one of the many changelog techs.

'''Chaos 2''' is a [[robot]] from [[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]], designed and built by self-employed [[mechanic]] George Francis, from [[Ipswich]], and operated by Team Chaos. Twice winner of the UK Robot Wars Championship and the only robot with that distinction, it was the first robot to use its [[flipper]] to throw its opponents out of the [[arena]] altogether. This machine was also the first to defeat [[Hypno-Disc]], in Series 3. Its flipper is considered to be the most powerful in Robot Wars, although it is not as powerful as the catapult-style flipper of Wheely Big Cheese. However, its weapon is superior in terms of [[Mechanical efficiency|efficiency]], but has a limited supply of {{CO2}}, which provides the power for the weapon. The robot has been reincarnated several times over the years, previously appearing as Robot The Bruce and Chaos. Its flipper was also used as a [[self-righting]] mechanism when the robot was inverted, flipping the entire robot over in a half-[[somersault]] so it could continue fighting. Chaos 2 is an inaugural member of the [[Combat Robot Hall of Fame]]. It also has its own [[pullback motor|pullback]] minibot and DVD. == Statistics == [[Image:Chaos2.jpg|thumb|Chaos 2]] {|- |- |Weight: ||84 kg (during its last appearance in Robot Wars Extreme: Series 2) |- |Dimensions: ||38 cm × 92 cm × 72 cm |- |Clearance: ||7 cm |- |Power: ||electric motors |- |Weapons: ||powerful pneumatic [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] powered flipper |} == Battle summary == === Series 3 === ;UK Championship {| class="wikitable" !
