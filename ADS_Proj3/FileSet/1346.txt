Its aims are to promote a high level of education and training of practitioners, professionalism in the engineering profession, and the interests of the profession in the country. In South Africa [[Professional Engineer]]s are recognised by the [[post-nominal]] ''Pr.Eng.'' or ''PrEng'' for engineers holding a [[B.Eng.]], [[B.Sc.]] or B.Sc.Eng. with relevant experience, and by ''Pr.Tech.Eng.'' (Professional [[Engineering technician|Engineering Technologist]]) for engineers holding a [[B.Tech]] with relevant experience and three years of practice; see [[Professional_Engineer#Africa|Professional Engineer: Africa]]. ECSA was established in terms of the Engineering Profession Act, 2000 (Act No. 46 of 2000), although its history dates to the '''South African Council for Professional Engineers''' (SACPE) in 1969. ==External links and references== *[http://www.ecsa.co.za/ ecsa.co.za] [[Category:Engineering societies]] [[Category:Research institutes in South Africa]] {{prof-assoc-stub}} {{SouthAfrica-org-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>12165</id> <title>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</title> <text>{{Infobox Organization |name = Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council |image = EPSRC logo.png |size = 200px |caption = EPSRC logo |abbreviation = EPSRC |formation = 1994 |status = Government agency |purpose = Funding of science and engineering research |location = North Star Avenue, [[Swindon]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] |region_served = UK |membership = |leader_title = Chief Executive |leader_name = David Delpy |main_organ = EPSRC Council |parent_organization = [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills|DIUS]] |affiliations = [[Research Councils UK|RCUK]], [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]], [[UK Space Agency|UKSA]] |budget = £740m |website = [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk EPSRC] }} <!--For fair use rationale see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:EPSRC logo.png#Licensing --> The '''Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council''' ('''EPSRC''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Research Council]] that provides [[UK government|government]] funding for grants to undertake [[research]] and postgraduate degrees in [[engineering]] and the [[physical sciences]] (including [[mathematics]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]]), mainly to [[university|universities]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The head office is in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]] in the same building ([http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/findus/default.htm Polaris House]) that houses the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]], [[Natural Environment Research Council]], [[Research Councils UK]], and the [[UK Space Agency]]. ==History== EPSRC was created in 1994. It was formerly a part of the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC). ==Structure== Former [[Network Rail]]'s chief executive [[John Armitt]] was appointed the Chairman of the EPSRC from 1 April 2007 for four years. He succeeded Dame [[Julia Higgins]]. As of September 2007 the chief executive and deputy chair of EPSRC is [[David Delpy]] FRS, a [[medical physics|medical physicist]] and formerly vice provost at [[University College London]] [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0705/07053002]. ==Functions== In addition to funding academic research projects, the EPSRC also funds [[Doctoral_Training_Centre|Doctoral Training Centres (DTCs)]] (now sometimes also referred to as Centres for Doctoral Training or CDTs). These deliver four-year doctoral training programmes to cohorts of PhD students studying within UK universities, and are funded to target specific areas of research for which there is recognised need. In 2008, the EPSRC has announced funding for 44 new DTCs spanning its entire remit.<ref name=NewDTCs>[http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/PostgraduateTraining/Centres/NewCentres.htm New Centres for Doctoral Training - December 2008], from EPSRC's site</ref><ref name="DTC University">,{{cite web|url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/studentservices/moneymatters/pgstudents.htm|title= UEL - DTC University}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk EPSRC website] * [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk Grants information] * [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/PostgraduateTraining/DoctoralTrainingAccounts/default.htm Doctoral Training Accounts] * [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/PostgraduateTraining/Centres/Background.htm Centres for Doctoral Training] * [http://www.rcuk.ac.uk Research Councils UK] ===Video clips=== * [http://www.youtube.com/user/EPSRCvideo EPSRC YouTube channel] {{Department for Business, Innovation and Skills}} {{Science and technology in the United Kingdom}} [[Category:Science and technology in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Research Councils]] [[Category:Organisations based in Wiltshire]] [[Category:Government agencies established in 1994]] [[Category:Swindon]] [[Category:Engineering organizations]] [[Category:Mathematics organizations]] [[Category:Computer science organizations]] [[Category:Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]</text>
