For example, the set of all numbers <math>x</math> satisfying <math>0 \le x \le 1</math> is an interval which contains <math>0</math> and <math>1</math>, as well as all numbers between them. Other examples of intervals are the set of all real numbers <math>\R</math>, the set of all negative real numbers, and the [[empty set]]. Real intervals play an important role in the theory of [[Integral|integration]], because they are the simplest sets whose "size" or "measure" or "length" is easy to define. The concept of measure can then be extended to more complicated sets of real numbers, leading to the [[Borel measure]] and eventually to the [[Lebesgue measure]]. Intervals are central to [[interval arithmetic]], a general [[numerical method|numerical computing]] technique that automatically provides guaranteed enclosures for arbitrary formulas, even in the presence of uncertainties, mathematical approximations, and [[rounding error|arithmetic roundoff]]. ==Notations for intervals== The interval of numbers between <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, including <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, is often denoted <math>[a,b]</math>. The two numbers are called the ''endpoints'' of the interval. ===Excluding the endpoints=== To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, many writers substitute a parenthesis for the corresponding square bracket. Thus, in [[set builder notation]], : <math> \begin{align} (a,b) &= \{x\in\R\,|\,a<x<b\}, \\{} [a,b) &= \{x\in\R\,|\,a\le x<b\}, \\ (a,b] &= \{x\in\R\,|\,a<x\le b\}, \\{} [a,b] &= \{x\in\R\,|\,a\le x\le b\}. \end{align} </math> Note that <math>(a,a)</math>, <math>[a,a)</math>, and <math>(a,a]</math> denote the empty set, whereas <math>[a,a]</math> denotes the set <math>\{a\}</math>. When <math>a > b</math>, all four notations are usually assumed to represent the empty set. ===The ISO notation=== [[International standard]] [[ISO 31-11]] also defines another notation for intervals, which seems to be more commonly taught in Europe{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and South America. It uses an inwards pointing [[bracket (punctuation)|bracket]] to indicate inclusion of the endpoint, and outwards-pointing bracket for exclusion: : <math> \begin{align} \left]a,b\right[ &= \{x\,|\, a< x < b\}, \\ \left[a,b\right[ &= \{x\,|\, a\le x < b\}, \\ \left]a,b\right] &= \{x\,|\, a< x \le b\}, \\{} [a,b] &= \{ x \,| \,a \le x \le b \} \end{align} </math> Both notations may overlap with other uses of parentheses and brackets in mathematics. For instance, the notation <math>(a,b)</math> is often used to denote an [[tuple|ordered pair]] in set theory, the [[coordinates]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] or [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] in [[analytic geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], or (sometimes) a [[complex number]] in [[algebra]]. The notation <math>[a,b]</math> too is occasionally used for ordered pairs, especially in [[computer science]]. Some authors use <math>]a,b[</math> to denote the complement of the interval <math>(a,b)</math>; namely, the set of all real numbers that are either less than or equal to ''a'', or greater than or equal to ''b''. In countries where numbers are written with a [[decimal comma]], a [[semicolon]] may be used as a separator, to avoid ambiguity. ===Infinite endpoints=== In both styles of notation, one may use an [[infinity (mathematics)|infinite]] endpoint to indicate that there is no bound in that direction. Specifically, one may use <math>a=-\infty</math> or <math>b=+\infty</math> (or both). For example, <math>(0,+\infty)</math> is the set of all positive real numbers, and <math>(-\infty,+\infty)</math> is the set of real numbers. The notations <math>[-\infty,b]</math>, <math>[-\infty,b)</math>, <math>[a,+\infty]</math>, and <math>(a,+\infty]</math> are ambiguous. For authors who define intervals as subsets of the real numbers, those notations are either meaningless, or equivalent to the open variants. In the latter case, the interval comprising all real numbers is both open and closed, <math>(-\infty,+\infty) = [-\infty,+\infty] = [-\infty,+\infty) = (-\infty,+\infty]</math>. ===Integer intervals=== When <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are [[integer]]s, the notation <math>[a\;..\;b]</math>, <math>\{ a\;..\;b \}</math>, or just <math> a\;..\;b </math> is sometimes used to indicate the interval of all ''integers'' between <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, including both. This notation is used in some [[programming language]]s; in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], for example, it is used to define the set of valid [[index (mathematics)|indices]] of a [[Array data type|vector]]. An integer interval that has a finite lower or upper endpoint always includes that endpoint. Therefore, the exclusion of endpoints can be explicitly denoted by writing <math> a\;..\; b-1 </math>, <math> a+1\; ..\; b </math>, or <math> a+1\;..\; b-1 </math>. Alternate-bracket notations like <math>[a\; ..\; b)</math> or <math>\left[a\; ..\; b\right[</math> are rarely used for integer intervals. ==Terminology== An '''open interval''' does not include its endpoints, and is indicated with parentheses. For example <math>(0,1)</math> means greater than 0 and less than 1. Conversely, a '''closed interval''' includes its endpoints, and is denoted with square brackets. For example <math>[0,1]</math> means greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. A '''degenerate interval''' is any [[singleton set|set consisting of a single real number]]. Some authors include the empty set in this definition. An interval that is neither empty nor degenerate is said to be '''proper''', and has infinitely many elements. An interval is said to be '''left-bounded''' or '''right-bounded''' if there
