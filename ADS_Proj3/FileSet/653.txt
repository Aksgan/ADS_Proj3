After working as a civil engineer on dam, canal and bridge projects throughout Europe for many years, he was appointed superintendent of the [[École nationale des ponts et chaussées]] (School of Bridges and Roads) in 1830, a position he held until 1836. He became an inspector in the [[Corps of Bridges and Roads (France)|Corps des Ponts]] (Corps of Bridges) from which he retired in 1851, dedicating himself to private research thereafter. ==Work == [[Image:Minard.png|275px|thumb|right|Charles Minard's [[flow map]] of Napoleon's March]] [[Image:Minard-carte-viande-1858.png|thumb|275px|Minard's map using [[pie chart]]s to represent the cattle sent from all around [[France]] for consumption in [[Paris]] (1858).]] ===Information graphics=== Minard was a pioneer of the use of graphics in engineering and statistics. He is famous for his ''Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l'Armée Française dans la campagne de Russie 1812-1813'', a [[flow map]] published in 1869 on the subject of [[Napoleon]]'s disastrous [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|Russian campaign of 1812]]. The graph displays several variables in a single [[two-dimensional]] image: * the army's location and direction, showing where units split off and rejoined * the declining size of the army (note e.g. the crossing of the [[Battle of Berezina|Berezina river]] on the retreat) * the low temperatures during the retreat. [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] first called notice to this dramatic depiction of the terrible fate of Napoleon's army in the Russian campaign, saying it "defies the pen of the historian in its brutal eloquence". [[Edward Tufte]] says it "may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn"<ref>[[Edward R. Tufte]] (2001). ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''. p. 40</ref> and uses it as a prime example in ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''. And Howard Wainer also identified this as a gem of information graphics, nominating it as the "World's Champion Graph".<ref>Howard Wainer (1984). "How to Display Data Badly".
