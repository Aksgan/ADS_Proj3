The definition of IT operations differ throughout the IT [[industry]], where [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] and individual organizations often create their own custom definitions of such processes and services for the purpose of [[marketing]] their own products. Usually, they include [[management]], envisioning, [[planning]], [[design]], [[implementation]], construction, [[Software deployment|deployment]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[Software verification|verification]], [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]], instantiation, [[Execution (computers)|execution]] and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]. They endeavor to define common processes and procedures, policies, roles, responsibilities, [[terminology]], [[best practices]] and standards for running an enterprise. == See also == * [[IT asset management]] * [[IT service management]] * [[IT governance]] [[Category:Information technology management|Operations]] [[Category:Process management]] {{compu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>18387</id> <title>Infoshop.org</title> <text>{{Infobox Website |name = Infoshop.org |logo = [[Image:Infoshop.org logo.jpg]] |screenshot = |caption = |url = http://www.infoshop.org |commercial = No |type = [[Anarchism|Anarchist]] resource |language = |registration = |owner = [[Alternative Media Project]] |author = [[Chuck Munson]] |launch date = January 1995 |current status = |revenue = |slogan = "kill [[capitalism]] before it kills you" }} '''Infoshop.org''' is an [[anarchist]] website and project of the [[Alternative Media Project]]. == History == Infoshop was founded in January 1995 as the Mid-Atlantic Infoshop by [[Chuck Munson]].<ref name=alas>"[http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2008spain-interviews-chuck Alasbarricadas interviews Infoshop founder, Chuck Munson]", Infoshop.org, 2008-02-20.</ref> Having previously co-founded an online archive of anarchist texts, the [[Spunk Library]], in 1992, Munson established Infoshop as a general resource on anarchism, moving to the domain name Infoshop.org in 1998.<ref name=alas/> Munson reorganized the website as a collective project in 2001, and {{asof|November 2008|lc=on}}, it is run by a core of nine people, supplemented by regular writers and volunteers.<ref name=alas/> Having previously being involved in publishing ''[[Practical Anarchy]]'' magazine, the collective announced plans on launching a quarterly magazine titled ''Infoshop News & Views'' to go "head-to-head against other American leftist magazines".<ref name=alas/> == Features == A prominent feature of the site is Infoshop News, an open publishing newswire similar to that of [[Indymedia]].<ref name=owens/> Initiated in 1997, the news service is one of several thousand [[English language]] publishers carried by [[Google News]].
