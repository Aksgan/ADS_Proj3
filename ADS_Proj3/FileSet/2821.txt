<title>Match report</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}} In [[metadata]], a '''match report''' is a report that compares two distinct [[data dictionary|data dictionaries]] and creates a list of the [[data element]]s that have been identified as [[Semantic equivalence|semantically equivalent]]. == Use of match reports == Match reports are critical for systems that wish to automatically exchange data such as intelligent software agents. If one computer system is requesting a report from a remote system that uses a distinct data dictionary and all of the data elements on the report manifest are included in the '''match report''' the report request can be executed. Match reports are useful if data dictionaries use a metadata tagging system such as the [[UDEF]]. ==See also== *[[Data dictionary]] *[[Data warehouse]] *[[Metadata]] *[[Semantic equivalence]] *[[Universal Data Element Framework]] [[Category:Knowledge representation]] [[Category:Data management]] [[Category:Technical communication]] [[Category:Metadata]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23711</id> <title>Mathematical puzzle</title> <text>'''Mathematical puzzles''' make up an integral part of [[recreational mathematics]]. They have specific rules as do [[multiplayer game]]s, but they do not usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, to solve such a [[puzzle]], the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. Mathematical puzzles require mathematics to solve them. [[Logic puzzle]]s are a common type of mathematical puzzle. [[Conway's Game of Life]] and [[fractals]], as two examples, may also be considered mathematical puzzles even though the solver interacts with them only at the beginning by providing a set of initial conditions. After these conditions are set, the rules of the puzzle determine all subsequent changes and moves. == List of mathematical puzzles == The following categories are not disjoint; some puzzles fall into more than one category. === Numbers, arithmetic, and algebra === * [[Cross-figure]]s or Cross number Puzzle * [[Dyson number]]s * [[Four fours]] * [[Feynman Long Division Puzzles]] * [[Pirate loot problem]] * [[Verbal arithmetic]]s === Combinatorial === * [[Cryptograms]] * [[N-puzzle|Fifteen Puzzle]] * [[Kakuro]] * [[Rubik's Cube]] and other [[Mechanical puzzle#Sequential movement puzzle|sequential movement puzzles]] * [[Sudoku]] * [[Think-a-Dot]] * [[Tower of Hanoi]] === Analytical or differential === * [[Ant on a rubber rope]] : ''See also:'' [[Zeno's paradoxes]] === Probability === * [[Monty Hall problem]] <!--- Not a game ---> === Tiling, packing, and dissection === * [[Bedlam cube]] * [[Conway puzzle]] * [[Mutilated chessboard problem]] * [[Packing problem]] * [[Pentomino]]es tiling * [[Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle]] * [[Soma cube]] * [[T puzzle]] * [[Tangram]] === Involves a board === * [[Conway's Game of Life]] <!--- Not a game ---> * [[Mutilated chessboard problem]] * [[Peg solitaire]] * [[Sudoku]] <!--- Not a game ---> ==== Chessboard tasks ==== * [[Eight queens puzzle]] * [[Knight's Tour]] * [[No-three-in-line problem]] === Topology, knots, graph theory === The fields of [[knot theory]] and [[topology]], especially their non-intuitive conclusions, are often seen as a part of recreational mathematics. * [[Disentanglement puzzle]]s * [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] * [[Water, gas, and electricity]] === Mechanical === {{Main|Mechanical puzzle}} * [[Rubik's Cube]] * [[Think-a-Dot]] === 0-player puzzles === * [[Conway's Game of Life]] <!--- Not a game ---> * [[Flexagon]] <!-- Not a game --> * [[Polyominoes]] ==External links== *[http://mathdl.maa.org/convergence/1/?pa=content&sa=browseNode&categoryId=9 Historical Math Problems/Puzzles] at [http://mathdl.maa.org/convergence/1/ Convergence] [[Category:Recreational mathematics|*]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23718</id> <title>Mathematics</title> <text>{{Dablink|"Maths" and "Math" redirect here.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in ''[[Euclid's Elements]]''. Mathematics continued to develop, for example in China in 300 BC, in India in AD 100, and in the [[Muslim world]] in AD 800, until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that continues to the present day.<ref>Eves</ref> Mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including [[natural science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]], the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as [[statistics]] and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians also engage in [[pure mathematics]], or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.<ref>Peterson</ref> ==Etymology== The word "mathematics" comes from the [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), which means ''learning'', ''study'', ''science'', and additionally came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study", even in Classical times.<ref>Both senses can be found in Plato.
