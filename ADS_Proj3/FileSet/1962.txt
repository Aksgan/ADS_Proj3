build out of large cut blocks, joined with metal cramps. This was a slow expensive and laborious process which limited the number of buildings that could be constructed. The metal cramps have often led to later failure through corrosion. Building structures used a simple beam and column system without vaults or arches, which based strict limits on the spans that could achieved. However the Greeks did construct [[Arch Bridge]]s. Greek mathematics was technically advanced and we know for certain that they employed and understood the principles of [[pulley]]s, which would have enabled them to build gibs and cranes to lift heavy stonework to the upper parts of buildings. Their surveying skills were exceptional, enabling them to set out the incredibly exact optical corrections of buildings like the [[Parthenon]], although the methods used remain a mystery. Simpler decoration, such as fluting on columns was simply left until the drums of the columns were cut in place. The Ancient Greeks never developed the strong mortars which were to become such an important feature of Roman construction. ===Roman construction=== {{See|Roman engineering|Concrete Revolution}} {{wide image|Thermae of Caracalla Panorama.jpg|600px|<center>The [[Baths of Caracalla]], in 2009</center>}} [[File:Roemerkran.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[treadwheel crane]] at [[Bonn]], Germany]] [[File:Pantheon oculus.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon in Rome]] looking up inside the concrete dome.]] In striking contrast to previous cultures, an enormous amount is known about Roman building construction. A very large amount survives, including complete intact buildings like the [[Pantheon, Rome]] and very well preserved ruins at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. We also have the first surviving treatise on architecture by [[Vitruvius]] which includes extensive passages on construction techniques. ====Materials==== The great Roman breakthrough was the development of hydraulic [[lime mortar]]. Previous cultures had used lime mortars but by adding volcanic ash the Romans managed to make a mortar that would harden underwater. This provided them with a cheap material for bulk walling. They used brick or stone to build the outer skins of the wall and then filled the space between with massive amounts of [[concrete]], effectively using the brickwork as permanent shuttering. The concrete, being formed of nothing more than rubble and mortar was cheap and very easy to produce, requiring relatively unskilled labour, enabling the Romans to build huge on an unprecedented scale. They not only used it for walls but also to form [[arch]]es, [[barrel vaults]] and [[dome]]s, which they built over huge spans. The Romans developed systems of hollow pots for making their domes and sophisticated heating and ventilation systems for their thermal baths. Glass was commonly used in windows. ====Organisation of Labour==== The Romans had trade guilds. Most construction was done by slaves or freed men. The use of slave labour undoubtedly cut costs and was one of the reasons for the scale of some of the structures. The Romans placed a considerable emphasis in building their buildings extremely fast, usually within two years. For very large structures the only way this could be achieved was by the application of vast numbers of workers to the task. ====Technology==== [[Vitruvius]] gives details of many Roman machines. The Romans developed sophisticated timber cranes allowing them to lift considerable weights to great heights. The upper limit of lifting appears to have been 100 tonnes. Trajan's column in Rome contains some of the largest stones ever lifted in a Roman building and engineers are still uncertain exactly how it was achieved. ====Outstanding technical Achievements==== A list of the longest, highest and deepest Roman structures can be found at [[List of ancient architectural records]]. Roman building ingenuity extended over [[bridge]]s, [[aqueduct]]s, and covered [[amphitheatre]]s. Their sewerage and water supply works were remarkable and some systems are still in operation today. The only aspect of Roman construction for which very little evidence survives is the form of timber roof structures, none of which are thought to have survives intact. Nevertheless its is generally agreed however that the Romans used triangulated roof trusses as this is the only way they could have covered the immense spans they achieved, the longest exceeding 30 metres (see [[List of ancient roofs]]). ===Medieval construction=== {{See|Medieval technology|Vault (architecture)}} {{multiple image | align = center | direction = horizontal | image1 = Notre Dame dalla Senna crop.jpg | width1 = 234 | alt1 = | caption1 = [[Notre Dame, Paris]] | image2 = Castle Bodiam1 cz.jpg | width2 = 260 | alt2 = | caption2 = Castle Bodiam, [[England]] | image3 = 876MilanoDuomo.JPG | width3 = 226 | alt3 = | caption3 = [[Milan Cathedral]], [[Italy]] }} In the [[Middle Ages]] of Europe [[fortification]]s, [[castle]]s and [[Architecture of cathedrals, basilicas and abbey churches|cathedral]]s were the greatest construction projects. The Roman building techniques were lost. ====Materials==== Most buildings in Northern Europe were constructed of timber until c.1000 AD. In Southern Europe adobe remained predominant. Brick continued to be manufactured in Italy throughout the period 600-1000 AD but elsewhere the craft of brickmaking had largely disappeared and with it the methods for burning tiles. Roofs were largely thatched. Houses were small and gathered around a large communal hall. Monasticism spread more sophisticated building techniques. The [[Cistercians]] may have been responsible for reintroducing brickmaking to the area from Holland, through Denmark and Northern Germany to Poland leading to [[Backsteingotik]]. Brick remained the most popular prestige material in these areas throughout the period. Elsewhere buildings were typically in timber or where it could be afforded, stone. Medieval stone walls were constructed using cut blocks on the outside of the walls and rubble infill, with weak [[lime mortar]]s. The poor hardening properties of these mortars were a continual problem, and the settlement of the rubble filling of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] walls and piers is still a major cause for concern. ====Design==== [[Image:VillardButtressReims.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villard de Honnecourt]]'s drawing of a flying buttress at [[Notre-Dame de Reims|Reims]], ca. AD 1320–1335 ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]])]] There were no standard textbooks on building in the Middle Ages. Master craftsmen transferred their knowledge through apprenticeships and from father to son. Trade secrets were closely guarded, as they were the source of a
