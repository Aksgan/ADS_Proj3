August 21, 1999 (00:00:19 TAI on August 22, 1999). To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584 days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern the modernized GPS navigation message uses a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192 weeks (157 years), thus lasting until the year 2137 (157 years after GPS week zero). === Carrier phase tracking (surveying) === Another method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency times the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about 0.19 meters for the L1 carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge, reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as 2 millimeters. This compares to 3 meters for the C/A code and 0.3 meters for the P code. However, 2 millimeter accuracy requires measuring the total phase—the number of waves times the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. Triple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted. The satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\ \phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\ \ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\ \phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\ \phi_{i,j,k} = \phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\ \Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\ \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\ \Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t </math> , with the values defined as :<math>\ \Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> , :<math>\ \Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> , and :<math>\ \Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> . Also if <math>\ \alpha_{i,j,k}\ and\ \beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then <math>\ ( a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as :<math>\ \Delta^r(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n}) = a \ \Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) + b \ \Delta^r(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> , :<math>\ \Delta^s(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} )= a \ \Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) + b \ \Delta^s(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> , and :<math>\ \Delta^t(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} )= a \ \Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) + b \ \Delta^t(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> . Receiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite 1 with that from satellite 2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |title=Between-Satellite Differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\ \Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}) = \phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}</math> Double differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |title=Double differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> computes the difference of receiver 1's satellite difference from that of receiver 2. This approximately eliminates satellite clock errors. This double difference is: :<math>\begin{align} \Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}))\,&=\,\Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}) &=\,\Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1}) - \Delta^r(\phi_{1,1,1}) &=\,(\phi_{2,2,1} - \phi_{1,2,1}) - (\phi_{2,1,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}) \end{align}</math> Triple differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/636.htm |title=Triple differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> subtracts the receiver difference from time 1 from that of time 2. This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wave lengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is: :<math>\ \Delta^t(\Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math> Triple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example if the position of receiver 1 is known but the position of receiver 2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver 2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs quite possibly will be sufficient to solve for receiver 2's three position components. This may require the use of a numerical procedure.<ref name="NR1">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UQW_VL2H56IC&pg=PA959&lpg=PA959&dq=%22Numerical+Analysis%22+multidimension++root+finding&source=web&ots=PLUUjn-33v&sig=P7btHJELgxmVpNI6_SnYjVZvUJc&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA442,M1 |title=Preview of Root Finding |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> An approximation of receiver 2's position is required to use such a numerical method. This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver 2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver 2 which best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver 2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares. == Other systems == {{Main|Global Navigation Satellite System}} Other satellite navigation systems in use or various states of development include: * {{flagicon|EUR}} [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] – a global system being developed by the [[European Union]] and other partner countries, planned to be operational by 2014 * {{flagicon|CHN}} [[Beidou navigation system|Beidou]] – [[People's Republic of China]]'s regional system, covering Asia and the West Pacific<ref>[[commons:File:China-Japan-South Korea trilateral meeting.png|Beidou coverage]]</ref> * {{flagicon|CHN}} [[COMPASS navigation system|COMPASS]] – People's Republic of China's global system, planned to be operational by 2020<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2010-05/20/content_4222569.htm |title=Beidou satellite navigation system to cover whole world in 2020 |publisher=Eng.chinamil.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/technology/23iht-galileo23.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=chinese%20europe%20galileo&st=cse New York Times]</ref> * {{flagicon|RUS}} [[GLONASS]] – [[Russia]]'s global navigation system * {{flagicon|IND}} [[IRNSS]] – [[India]]'s regional navigation system, planned to be operational by 2012, covering India and Northern Indian Ocean<ref>{{cite
