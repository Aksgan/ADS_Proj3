in the case of a modular AP called ''Module Integrated Models'' (MIM). These integrated models are constructed by choosing generic objects defined in lower level data models (4x, 5x, 1xx, 5xx) and adding specializations needed for the particular application domain of the AP. The common generic data models are the basis for interoperability between APs for different kinds of industries and life cycle stages. In APs with several ''Conformance Classes'' the top data model is divided into subsets, one for each Conformance Class. The requirements of a conformant STEP application are: * implementation of either a [[preprocessor]] or a [[postprocessor]] or both, * using one of the STEP implementation methods STEP-File, STEP-XML or SDAI for the AIM/MIM data model and * supporting one or several conformance classes of an AP. Originally every APs was required to have a companion [[Abstract test suite]] (ATS) (e.g. ATS 303 for AP 203), providing [[Test Purposes]], [[Verdict Criteria]] and [[Abstract Test Cases]] together with example STEP-Files. But because the development of an ATS was very expensive and inefficient this requirement was dropped and replaced by the requirements to have an informal validation report and recommended practises how to use it. Today the recommended practises are a primary source for those going to implement STEP. The ''Application Reference Models'' (ARM) is the mediator between the AAM and the AIM/MIM. Originally its purpose was only to document high level application objects and the basic relations between them. [[IDEF1X]] diagrams documented the AP of early APs in an informal way. The ARM objects, their attributes and relations are mapped to the AIM so that it is possible to implement an AP. As APs got more and more complex formal methods were needed to document the ARM and so EXPRESS which was originally only developed for the AIM was also used for the ARM. Over time these ARM models got very detailed till to the point that some implementations preferred to use the ARM instead of the formally required AIM/MIM. Today a few APs have ARM based exchange formats standardized outside of ISO TC184/SC4: * PLM-Services within the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] for AP 214 * [[ISO 14649]] ''Data model for computerized numerical controllers'' for AP 238 * PLCS-DEXs within [[OASIS (organization)]] for AP 239 There is a bigger overlap between APs because they often need to refer to the same kind of products, product structures, geometry and more. And because APs are developed by different groups of people it was always an issue to ensure interoperability between APs on a higher level. The ''Application integrated constructs'' (AIC) solved this problem for common specializations of generic concepts, primarily in the geometric area. To address the problem of harmonizing the ARM models and their mapping to the AIM the ''STEP modules'' were introduced. They contain a piece of the ARM, the mapping and a piece of the AIM, called MIM. Modules are built on each other, resulting in an (almost) directed graph with the AP and conformance class modules at the very top. The modular APs are: * AP 203, ''Configuration controlled 3D design'', TS and 2nd edition * AP 209, ''Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design'' * AP 210, ''Electronic assembly, interconnect and packaging design'' * AP 221, ''Functional data and schematic representation of process plants'' * AP 236, ''Furniture product data and project data'' * AP 239, ''Product life cycle support'' * AP 241, ''Generic Model for Life Cycle Support of AEC Facilities'' (planned) * AP 242, ''Managed model based 3d engineering'' (under development) The modular editions of AP 209 and 210 are explicit extensions of AP 203. == Coverage of STEP Application Protocols (AP) == The STEP APs can be roughly grouped into the three main areas design, manufacturing and life cycle support. Design APs: * Mechanical: ** AP 201, ''Explicit draughting''. Simple 2D drawing geometry related to a product. No association, no assembly hierarchy. ** AP 202, ''Associative draughting''. 2D/3D drawing with association, but no product structure. ** AP 203, ''Configuration controlled 3D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies''. ** AP 204, ''Mechanical design using boundary representation'' ** AP 207, ''Sheet metal die planning and design'' ** AP 209, ''Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design'' ** AP 214, ''Core data for automotive mechanical design processes'' ** AP 235, ''Materials information for the design and verification of products'' ** AP 236, ''Furniture product data and project data'' ** AP 242, ''Managed model based 3d engineering'' (under development) * Connectivity oriented electric, electronic and piping/ventilation: ** AP 210, ''Electronic assembly, interconnect and packaging design''. The most complex and sohisticated STEP AP. ** AP 212, ''Electrotechnical design and installation''. ** AP 227, ''Plant spatial configuration'' * Ship: ** AP 215, ''Ship arrangement'' ** AP 216, ''Ship moulded forms'' ** AP 218, ''Ship structures'' * Others: ** AP 225, ''Building elements using explicit shape representation'' ** AP 232, ''Technical data packaging core information and exchange'' ** AP 233, ''Systems engineering data representation'' ** AP 237, ''Fluid dynamics'' Manufacturing APs: * AP 219, ''Dimensional inspection information exchange'' * AP 223, ''Exchange of design and manufacturing product information for cast parts'' * AP 224, ''Mechanical product definition for process plans using machining features'' * [[STEP-NC|AP 238 - ''Application interpreted model for computer numeric controllers'']] * AP 240, ''Process plans for machined products'' Life cycle support APs: * AP 239, ''Product life cycle support'' * AP 221, ''Functional data and schematic representation of process plants'' * AP 241, ''Generic Model for Life Cycle Support of AEC Facilities'' (planned) The AP 221 model is very similar to the ISO 15926-2 model, whereas AP 221 follows the STEP architecture and ISO 15926-2 has a different architecture. They both use ISO-15926-4 as their common reference data library or dictionary of standard instances. A further development of both standards resulted in [[Gellish English]] as general product modeling language that is application domain independent and that is proposed as a work item (NWI) for a new standard. The original intent of STEP was to
