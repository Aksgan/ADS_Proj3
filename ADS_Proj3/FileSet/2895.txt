Every Web designer should have a copy.” In the Photoshop CS1 release (version 8) of Photoshop, Adobe included one of his tutorials in the Welcome Screen. Michael Baumgardt has been also a speaker at several of the Photoshop World Conferences [http://www.photoshopworld.com]. In 2004 he published QuarkXPress 6 for Print and Web (Peachpit Press), which was highly praised by Shellie Hall [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321168909], the official Xpress evangelist of Quark. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Bibliography== * 2004 Web Design mit Photoshop 7 (Addison-Wesley) * 2002 QuarkXPress 5 (Addison-Wesley) * 2001 Web Design mit Adobe Photoshop 6 (Addison-Wesley) * 2000 Web Design mit Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (Addison-Wesley) * 2000 Web Design Kreativ mit Video Tutorials auf CD (Springer) * 2000 Adobe Illustrator 9 (Addison-Wesley) * 1999 Web Design Kreativ (Springer) * 1999 Adobe Illustrator 8 (Addison-Wesley) * 1998 Web Design mit Adobe Photoshop 5 (Addison-Wesley) * 1998 QuarkXPress 4 (Addison-Wesley) * 1998 Creative Web Design (Springer, USA) * 1997 Kreatives DTP m.

([http://web.archive.org/web/20080129205055/http://stationq.ucsb.edu/index.html Station Q (archived page - 2008)])</ref> In 1986, he was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] for his work on the [[Poincaré conjecture]]. Freedman and [[Robion Kirby]] showed that an [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''<sup>4</sup>]] manifold exists. Freedman was born into a [[Jewish]] family in Los Angeles. He entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1968, and continued his studies at [[Princeton University]] where he received [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1973 for his doctoral dissertation titled ''Codimension-Two Surgery'', written under the supervision of [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]]. After graduating, Freedman was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He held this post from 1973 until 1975, when he became a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) at Princeton. In 1976 he was appointed assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). He spent the year 1980/81 at IAS, returning to UCSD, where in 1982 he was promoted to professor. He was appointed the Charles Lee Powell chair of mathematics at UCSD in 1985. Freedman has received numerous other awards and honors including [[Sloan Fellowship|Sloan]] and [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s, a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] and the [[National Medal of Science]]. He is an elected member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He currently works at [[Microsoft Station Q]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where his team is involved in the development of the [[topological quantum computer]]. ==Publications== *{{Citation | last1=Freedman | first1=Michael Hartley | title=The topology of four-dimensional manifolds | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214437136 | id={{MathSciNet | id = 679066}} | year=1982 | journal=Journal of Differential Geometry | issn=0022-040X | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=357–453}} * Michael H.
