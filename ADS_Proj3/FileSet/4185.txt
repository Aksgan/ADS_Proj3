here somewhat focuses on how the word applies to data-storage [[Media (communication)|media]]. See [[Disc (disambiguation)]] for other meanings. The earlier word is ''disk'', which came into the [[English language]] in the middle of the 17th century, and (probably following pre-existing words such as ''risk'') it was spelled with a ''k''. The spelling ''disc'' was introduced in the 18th century, following an increasing tendency to base the spelling of words on their roots: in this case the [[Latin]] word ''discus'' and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''δισκος'' (note that ''[[kappa]]'' in Greek is usually [[transliterate]]d by ''c'' rather than ''k''). In the 19th century, ''disc'' became the conventional spelling for [[audio recording]]s made on a flat plate, such as the [[gramophone record]]; this usage gave rise to the modern term ''[[disc jockey]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bartleby.com/61/16/C0521600.html |title= Compact disk |year= 2000 |work= [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |publisher= Bartleby.com}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=December 2010}} Early [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] technicians differentiated between ''disks'' (in-house transcription records) and ''discs'' (the colloquial term for commercial gramophone records, or what the BBC dubbed CGRs).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.btinternet.com/~roger.beckwith/bh/grams/grams_4.htm |title= Test Records |date= 2008-03-12 |accessdate= 2008-06-11 |author=Barry Taylor |publisher= [[BT Group|BTInternet]]}}</ref> By the 20th century, the ''c''-spelling was more popular in [[British English]], while the ''k''-spelling was preferred in [[American English]]. In the 1950s, when the American company [[IBM]] pioneered the first [[hard disk drive]] storage devices, the ''k''-spelling was used. Consequently, in [[computer jargon]] today it is common for the ''k''-spelling to refer mainly to magnetic storage devices (particularly in British English, where the term ''disk'' is sometimes regarded as a contraction of ''[[diskette]]'', a much later word and actually a diminutive of ''disk''). Some latter-day storage device manufacturers prefer the ''c''-spelling. In 1979 the Dutch company [[Philips]], along with [[Sony]], developed the [[compact disc]] medium; here, the ''c''-spelling was chosen. The ''c''-spelling is now used consistently for optical media such as the compact disc and similar technologies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/disc.html |title=Common Errors in English |author=Paul Brians |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |accessdate= 2008-06-11}}</ref> == References == {{Reflist}} == Further reading == {{refbegin}} * [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-disc-and-a-disk.htm What is the Difference Between a Disc and a Disk?], article at wiseGEEK.com * [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2300 Apple Support Document HT2300: What's the difference between a "disc" and a "disk?"] {{refend}} == See also == * [[Spelling]] [[Category:English spelling|Disc]] [[Category:American and British English differences]] [[Category:Computing terminology|Disc]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35349</id> <title>Spiceworks</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | logo = [[Image:Spiceworks logo.png|Spiceworks Inc. logo]] | screenshot = [[Image:spiceworks dashboard.JPG|265px]] | caption = SpiceWorks 5.0 on the "Dashboard" screen. | developer = SpiceWorks, Inc. | released = | frequently_updated = Yes <!-- Release version update?

The spiciness of a given thread would allow Spiceworks Inc. a better view as to what their current users wanted out of the application. This "Spiciness" was represented by a red [[Chili pepper]]. As the Spiceworks Community grew, several updates took place, one of which was the removal of the chilis. Later versions of the Spiceworks Community used generic plus and minus signs to show the "spiciness" of a thread, although this caused new Feature Requests by the Spiceworks Community for the resurgence of the chilis. As of September 12, 2007, Spiceworks has reincorporated the [[Chili pepper]] icon.<ref>[http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2998 Spiceworks - CHILI PEPPERS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. ===SpiceRex=== [[File:Spicerexhead.PNG|50px|left]]SpiceRex is the mascot of the Spiceworks community, showing his face first in a photo contest.<ref>[http://www.unofficialspiceworks.com/2010/03/the-story-off-the-spiceworks-spicerex/ The story of SpiceRex]</ref> It was a big hit with all the community members and on June 2, 2010 was released as the official community mascot along with the tag line "a force to be reckoned with."
