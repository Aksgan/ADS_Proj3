The Jordan curve (drawn in black) divides the plane into an "inside" region (light blue) and an "outside" region (pink).]] In [[topology]], a '''Jordan curve''' is a non-self-intersecting [[Loop (topology)|continuous loop]] in the plane. The '''Jordan curve theorem''' asserts that every Jordan curve divides the plane into an "interior" region bounded by the curve and an "exterior" region containing all far away points, so that any [[path (topology)|continuous path]] connecting a point of one region to a point of the other intersects that loop somewhere. While the statement is intuitively obvious, it takes quite a bit of ingenuity to prove it by elementary means. More transparent proofs rely on the machinery of [[algebraic topology]] and lead to generalisations to higher-dimensional spaces. The Jordan curve theorem is, perhaps, the oldest result in [[set-theoretic topology]] and is named after [[Camille Jordan]], who found the first proof. For a long time, it was generally thought that this proof had been flawed and that the first rigorous proof was due to [[Oswald Veblen]]; however, this view has been challenged by [[Thomas Callister Hales|Thomas Hales]]. == Definitions and the statement of the Jordan theorem == A '''Jordan curve''' or a '''simple closed curve''' in the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''C'' of an [[injective]] [[continuous map]] of a [[circle]] into the plane, ''&phi;'': ''S''<sup>1</sup> &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. A '''Jordan arc''' in the plane is the image of an injective continuous map of a closed interval into the plane. Alternatively, a Jordan curve is the image of a continuous map ''&phi;'': [0,1] &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup> such that ''&phi;''(0) = ''&phi;''(1) and the restriction of ''&phi;'' to [0,1) is injective. The first two conditions say that ''C'' is a continuous loop, whereas the last condition stipulates that ''C'' has no self-intersection points. <blockquote> Let ''C'' be a Jordan curve in the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Then its [[complement (set theory)|complement]], '''R'''<sup>2</sup> \ ''C'', consists of exactly two
