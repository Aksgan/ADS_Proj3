A person's Shusaku number can be determined, as follows: * Shusaku himself has the Shusaku number 0. * Any other Go player has the number 1 + the smallest Shusaku number of the player's opponents (provided at least one opponent has a Shusaku number). For example, if a player has played Shusaku himself, that player would have a Shusaku number of 1. * For all other people, the Shusaku number is undefined. To extend the analogy to [[Erdős number]]s even further, one can define '''Shusaku numbers of the second kind''' to only consider players who have defeated a lower-numbered opponent. That is, only those who have beaten Shusaku would have a Shusaku number of 1, and so forth. ==See also== *[[Erdős number]] *[[Bacon number]] *[[Erdős-Bacon number]] ==External links== *[http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShusakuNumber Sensei's Library: Shusaku Number] <!--Categories--> [[Category:Go]] [[Category:Social networks]] <!--Other languages--> <!--Stubs--> {{go-stub}} [[ja:秀策数]] [[zh:秀策數]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34291</id> <title>Shutdown (computing)</title> <text>{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2010}} {{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}} {{Stack|<!-- Stack begins --> [[Image:Mac OS X power dialog.png|200px|thumb|[[Mac OS X]] power management dialog box.]] [[Image:Windows XP Shutdown.png|200px|thumb|right|[[Windows XP]] shutdown dialog box.]] [[Image:Shutdown Options 7.png|200px|thumb|right|Shutdown options have been moved from a separate dialog box to the [[start menu]], in [[Windows Vista]] and later versions of Microsoft Windows.

After a computer is shut down, main components such as [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]] modules and [[hard disk drive]]s are powered down, although some internal components, such as internal clock, may retain power. ==Implementations== ===Mac OS X=== In [[Mac OS X]] the computer can be shut down by choosing "Shut Down…" from the [[Apple Menu]] or by pressing the power key to bring up the power management dialog box. An administrator may also use the Unix <code>shutdown</code> [[command (computing)|command]] as well. ===Windows=== In [[Microsoft Windows]], a PC or server is shut down by selecting the <tt>Shutdown</tt> item from the [[Start menu]] on the desktop. Options include shutting down the system and powering off, automatically restarting the system after shutting down, or putting the system into [[standby mode|stand-by mode]]. There is also a <code>shutdown</code> command that can be executed within a [[command shell]] window. <tt>shutdown.exe</tt> is the command-line shut down application that can shut down the user's computer or another computer on the user's network. Just like other operating systems, Windows allows to prohibit selected users to shutdown computer. On a Home PC, every user may have the shutdown option, but in network computers, an administrator can revoke the access rights of selected users to shutdown a windows computer. Nowadays there are many software utilities which can automate the task of shutting down a windows computer enabling automatic computer control. The Windows [http://www.shutdown.cc Shutdown] website lists various software utilities to automate the task of shutting down. ===Unix and Linux=== In [[Unix]] and [[Linux]], the <code>shutdown</code> command can be used to turn off or [[Booting|reboot]] a computer. Only the [[superuser]] can shut the system down. One commonly issued form of this command is <code>shutdown -h now</code>, which will shut down a system immediately. Another one is <code>shutdown -r now</code> to reboot. Another form allows the user to specify an exact time or a delay before shutdown: <code>shutdown -h 20:00</code> will turn the computer off at 8:00 PM, and <code>shutdown -r -t 60</code> will automatically reboot the machine within 60 seconds (one minute) of issuing the command. ==See also== * [[Booting]] * [[Halt]] * [[Hibernation (computing)|Hibernation]] * [[Sleep mode]] ==Further reading== * {{Cite web |title = Choices = Headaches |url = http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html |work = Joel on Software |last = Spolsky |first = Joel |authorlink = Joel Spolsky |date = 21 November 2006 |accessdate = 25 August 2010 }} {{Unix commands}} {{Windows commands}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Shutdown (Computing)}} [[Category:Operating system technology]] [[Category:Windows administration]] [[bar:Owafoan]] [[de:Herunterfahren]] [[ko:셧다운]] [[it:Arresto (informatica)]] [[ja:シャットダウン]] [[ru:Выключение вычислительной системы]] [[fi:Sammuttaminen (tietojenkäsittely)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34305</id> <title>Siamese method</title> <text>[[Image:SiameseMethod.gif|thumb|307px|A simple example of the Siamese method.
