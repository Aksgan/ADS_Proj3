up dust and dirt, usually from floors and carpets. Filtering systems or [[cyclonic separation|cyclones]] collect dirt for later disposal. Models include upright (dirty-air and clean-air), canister and backpack, wet-dry and pneumatic, and other varieties. Robotic vacuum cleaners have recently become viable as well. Vacuum-cleaner manufacturers are widespread and include [[Aerus LLC]], [[Bissell Inc.|Bissell]] Carpet Sweepers, [[Black & Decker DustBuster]], [[Dirt Devil]], [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]], [[Electrolux]], [[Eureka (vacuum cleaner)|Eureka]], [[Goblin Vacuum Cleaners]], [[the Hoover Company]], the [[Kirby Company]], [[Nilfisk-Advance]], [[Numatic International Limited]], the [[Oreck Corporation]], [[Regina (company)|Regina]] Vacuum Cleaners, [[Rexair LLC]], [[Samsung Electronics]] ===Stain removal=== [[Tea leaves]] and cut [[grass]] were formerly common for [[floor cleaning]], to collect dust from carpets, albeit with risks of stains. [[Ink]] was removed with [[lemon]] or with [[oxalic acid]] and [[hartshorn]]; oil with [[white bread]] or with [[pipe clay]]; grease [[fat]]s with [[turpentine]]; [[ox gall]] and [[naphtha]] were also general cleaners. [[Ammonia]] and [[chloroform]] were recommended for acid discoloration. [[Benzine]] and [[alum]] were suggested for removing insects;<ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=http://www.burrows.com/carpetcleaning/index.html|title=Historic Carpet Cleaning Methods in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> [[diatomaceous earth]] and material similar to [[cat litter]] are still common for removing infestations. Some traditional methods of stain removal remain successful and ecological. Caution should be addressed when treating natural fibers such as [[wool]]. The longer the stain material remains in the carpet, the higher the chance of permanent color change, even if all the original stain material is removed. Immediately blotting (not rubbing) the stain material as soon as possible will help reduce the chances of permanent color change. Artificial food coloring stains are generally considered permanent stains ([[Kool-Aid]], [[Gatorade]], [[Listerine]], soda, etc.). These may be removed by professionals with heat-transfer stain-reducing chemicals, but carry risks of burning the carpet. Stain removal products can be combined with anti-allergen treatments to kill house [[dust mites]]. ===Other=== Carpet rods, [[rattan]] rugbeaters, and carpet-beating machines for beating out dust, and also [[broom]]s, [[brush]]es, [[dustpan]]s, and shaking and hanging were all carpet-cleaning methods of the 19th century; brooms particularly carry risks of wear.<ref name=hist/> ===Misconceptions=== Robert Wittkamp (1942–2007), IICRC-certified master cleaning technician with 30 years' expertise in carpet cleaning, commented that [[old wives' tales]] persist and thrive within the industry. For instance, the concept that walking barefoot on a carpet may lead to damage from body oils has not been supported or disproven by standardized reports or testing or by industry evidence.<ref name=ics2>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6909517_ITM|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|title=Myths and Misconceptions (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2003-05-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Rugs and carpets}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Carpet Cleaning}} [[Category:Rugs and carpets]] [[Category:Floors]] [[Category:Cleaning]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5547</id> <title>Carry bypass adder</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=December 2009}} A ''carry bypass adder'' improves the delay of a [[Ripple_carry_adder#Ripple_carry_adder|ripple-carry adder]]. The two addends are split in blocks of ''n'' bits. The output carry of each block is dependent on the input carry only if, for each of the ''n'' bits in the block, at least one addend has a ''1'' bit (see the definition of carry propagation under ''[[Carry lookahead adder]]''). The output carry <math>\mathrm{Cout}_{i+n-1}</math>, for the block corresponding to bits ''i'' to ''i+n-1'' is obtained from a multiplexer, wired as follows: * <math>SEL = (A_i + B_i) (A_{i+1} + B_{i+1}) ... (A_{i+n-1} + B_{i+n-1})</math> * <math>A = \mathrm{C}_{ripple,i+n-1}</math> (the carry output for the ripple adder summing bits ''i'' to ''i+n-1'') * <math>B = \mathrm{C}_{out,i-1}</math> ==Implementation Overview== Breaking this down into more specific terms, in order to build a 4-bit carry bypass adder, 6 [[Full_adder#Full_adder|full adders]] would be needed. The input buses would be a 4-bit ''A'' and a 4-bit ''B'', with a carry in (''CIN'') signal. The output would be a 4-bit bus X and a carry out signal (''COUT''). The first two full adders would add the first two bits together. The carry out signal from the second full adder (<math>C_1</math>)would drive the select signal for three 2 to 1 multiplexers. The second set of 2 full adders would add the last two bits assuming <math>C_1</math> is a logical 0. And the final set of full adders would assume that <math>C_1</math> is a logical 1. The multiplexers then control which output signal is used for ''COUT'', <math>X_2</math> and <math>X_3</math>. ===Verilog=== module cba_4(A, B, X, CIN, COUT); input [3:0]A, B; input CIN; output [3:0]X; output COUT; reg [3:0]X; reg [2:0]base; reg [2:0]ifzero; reg [2:0]ifone; reg COUT; always @(A or B or CIN) begin base = A[1:0] + B[1:0] + {1'b0, CIN}; ifzero = A[3:2] + B[3:2]; ifone = A[3:2] + B[3:2] + 2'b01; if(base[2]) begin X = {ifone[1:0], base[1:0]}; COUT = ifone[2]; end else begin X = {ifzero[1:0], base[1:0]}; COUT = ifzero[2]; end end endmodule {{DEFAULTSORT:Carry Bypass Adder}} [[Category:Adders]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5564</id> <title>Cartopedia</title> <text>{{Wikify|date=December 2010}} '''''Cartopedia''': The Ultimate World Reference Atlas'' was an [[atlas]] program originally published by [[Dorling Kindersley]] Multimedia<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D81339F93AA35752C0A960958260|title=CD-ROM Atlases Shrug Off Details |last=Manes|first=Stephen|date=1996-01-09|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-20|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ej9lrCot|archivedate=2009-02-20}}</ref> in 1995<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA152994.html|title=The New World (Part II)|last=Del Vecchio|first=Stephen|date=1998-05-01|work=School Library Journal|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=2009-02-20|archivedate=2009-02-20|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ejA6MKcY}}</ref>.
