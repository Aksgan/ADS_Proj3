is, he is interested in how learning is transformed by the shift from the apparatus of literacy to the apparatus of what he comes to term ‘electracy’.<ref>http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue2/issue2_gye.html.</ref> </blockquote> Electracy as an educational aim has been recognized by scholars in several fields, including English composition and rhetoric,<ref>See Inman and also Leander,Kevin, and Paul Prior, "Speaking and Writing: How Talk and Text Interact in Situated Practices," <em>What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Texts and Textual Practices</em>, ed.

''Gottfried Semper in Zurich: An Intersection of Theory and Practice''. Ames, IA: Culicidae Architectural Press, 2005.</ref> Mikesch Muecke explains that "Gregory Ulmer's ideas on ''electracy'' provide … a model for a new pedagogy where learning is closer to invention than verification"<ref>Muecke, p. 4</ref> Ulmer himself writes: <blockquote> Electrate pedagogy is based in art/aesthetics as relays for operating new media organized as a prosthesis for learning any subject whatsoever. The near absence of art in contemporary schools is the electrate equivalent of the near absence of science in medieval schools for literacy. The suppression of empirical inquiry by religious dogmatism during the era sometimes called the "dark ages" (reflecting the hostility of the oral apparatus to literacy), is paralleled today by the suppression of aesthetic play by empirical utilitarianism (reflecting the hostility of the literate apparatus to electracy). The ambivalent relation of the institutions of school and entertainment today echoes the ambivalence informing church-science relations throughout the era of literacy.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> </blockquote> Ulmer's educational methods fit into a broader paradigm shift in pedagogical theory and practice known as [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. He discusses the relationship between pedagogy and electracy at length in an interview with Sung-Do Kim published in 2005.<ref>Kim, Sung-Do.

Alternatively, the user may become more involved with the project, manually creating sheep (video files of animated fractal flames) for upload to the server. As the screensaver entertains the user, their computer is also used for rendering commercial projects, sales of which keep the servers and developers running. These projects are available for sale on Scott Draves' personal website<ref>[http://scottdraves.com/for-sale.html Scott Draves - Software Artist]</ref>. There are about 500,000 active users (monthly uniques).<ref>http://www.triangulationblog.com/2011/01/scott-draves.html</ref>. According to Mitchell Whitelaw in his ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', "On the screen they are luminous, twisting, elastic shapes, abstract tangles and loops of glowing filaments."<ref>Mitchell Whitelaw (2004). ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life''. MIT Press. pp 155.</ref> The name "Electric Sheep" is taken from the title of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''. The title mirrors the nature of the project: computers (androids) who have started running the screensaver begin rendering (dreaming) the fractal movies ([[Counting sheep|sheep]]). The sheep motif is carried over into other aspects of the project: the 100 or so sheep stored on the server at any time is referred to as 'the flock'; creating a new fractal by interpolating or combining the sheep's fractal code with that of another sheep is called mating/breeding; changes to the code are called mutations, etc. The parameters that generate these movies (sheep) can be created in a few ways: they can be created and submitted by members of the electricsheep mailing list, members of the mailing list can download the parameters of existing sheep and tweak them, or sheep can be mated together automatically by the server or manually by server admins (nicknamed shepherds). Users may vote on sheep that they like or dislike, and this voting is used for the [[genetic algorithm]] which generates new sheep. Each movie is a [[fractal flame]] with several of its parameters [[Computer animation|changed over time]]. The individual frames of which these movies consist are rendered using 'spare' processing cycles from idle computers on the distributed network of those running the screensaver application, and finished sheep (in the form of .avi files)
