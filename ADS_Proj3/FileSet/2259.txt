each ''i''. The reason why this is so daunting is that (H3) constitutes a large system of coupled partial differential equations: for ''n'' degrees of freedom, (H3) constitutes a system of :<math>2 \left( \begin{matrix} n + 1 \\ 3 \end{matrix} \right)</math> partial differential equations in the 2''n'' independent variables that are the components ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub> of ''g'', where :<math>\left( \begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix} \right)</math> denotes the [[binomial coefficient]]. In order to construct the most general possible Lagrangian, one must solve this huge system! Fortunately, there are some auxiliary conditions that can be imposed in order to help in solving the Helmholtz conditions. First, (H1) is a purely algebraic condition on the unknown matrix ''g''. Auxiliary algebraic conditions on ''g'' can be given as follows: define functions :&Psi;<sub>''jk''</sub><sup>''i''</sup> by :<math>\Psi_{jk}^{i} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{\partial \Phi_{j}^{i}}{\partial v^{k}} - \frac{\partial \Phi_{k}^{i}}{\partial v^{j}} \right).</math> The auxiliary condition on ''g'' is then :<math>g_{mi} \Psi_{jk}^{m} + g_{mk} \Psi_{ij}^{m} + g_{mj} \Psi_{ki}^{m} = 0 \mbox{ for } 1 \leq i, j \leq n. \quad \mbox{(A)}</math> In fact, the equations (H2) and (A) are just the first in an infinite hierarchy of similar algebraic conditions. In the case of a [[parallel connection]] (such as the canonical connection on a Lie group), the higher order conditions are always satisfied, so only (H2) and (A) are of interest. Note that (A) comprises :<math>\left( \begin{matrix} n \\ 3 \end{matrix} \right)</math> conditions whereas (H1) comprises :<math>\left( \begin{matrix} n \\ 2 \end{matrix} \right)</math> conditions. Thus, it is possible that (H1) and (A) together imply that the Lagrangian function is singular. As of 2006, there is no general theorem to circumvent this difficulty in arbitrary dimension, although certain special cases have been resolved. A second avenue of attack is to see whether the system (E) admits a submersion onto a lower-dimensional system and to try to "lift" a Lagrangian for the lower-dimensional system up to the higher-dimensional one. This is not really an attempt to solve the Helmholtz conditions so much as it is an attempt to construct a Lagrangian and then show that its Euler&ndash;Lagrange equations are indeed the system (E). ==References== * {{cite journal | last=Douglas | first=Jesse | title=Solution of the inverse problem in the calculus of variations | journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society | volume=50 | pages=71&ndash;128 | year=1941 | issn=0002-9947 | doi=10.2307/1989912 | url=http://jstor.org/stable/1989912 | issue=1 | publisher=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 50, No. 1 }} * {{cite journal | author=Rawashdeh, M., & Thompson, G. | title=The inverse problem for six-dimensional codimension two nilradical Lie algebras | journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics | volume=47 | issue=11 | year=2006 | issn=0022-2488 | doi=10.1063/1.2378620 | pages=112901 }} [[Category:Calculus of variations]] [[Category:Lagrangian mechanics]] [[Category:Inverse problems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19290</id> <title>Inverse relationship</title> <text>[[File:Simple inverse relationship chart.svg|thumb|Linear inverse relationship]] An '''inverse''' or '''negative relationship''' is a [[mathematical relationship]] in which one [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], say '''y''', decreases as another, say '''x''', increases. For a linear (straight-line) relation, this can be expressed as '''y = a-bx''', where '''-b''' is a constant value less than zero and '''a''' is a constant. For example, there is an inverse relationship between education and unemployment — that is, as education increases, the rate of unemployment decreases. Inverse relationships and their counterpart, ''[[direct relationship]]s'', are widely used in the [[physical science]]s to describe the relationship between two variables in an equation. In [[economic graph]]ing, two variables are said to have an inverse relationship if the graph line slopes downward to the right. ==See also== * [[Direct relationship]] * [[Inverse relation]] [[Category:Elementary mathematics|Inverse relationship]] {{math-stub}} {{stat-stub}} [[ar:علاقة عكسية]] [[fr:Relation inverse]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19291</id> <title>Inverse semigroup</title> <text>In mathematics, an '''inverse semigroup''' ''S'' is a [[semigroup]] in which every element ''x'' in ''S'' has a unique '''inverse''' ''y'' in ''S'' in the sense that ''x = xyx'' and ''y = yxy''. Inverse semigroups appear in a range of contexts; for example, they can be employed in the study of [[partial symmetries]].<ref>Lawson 1998.</ref> (The convention followed in this article will be that of writing a function on the right of its argument, and composing functions from left to right &mdash; a convention often observed in semigroup theory.) == Origins == Inverse semigroups were introduced independently by [[Viktor Vladimirovich Wagner]]<ref>Since his father was German, Wagner preferred the German transliteration of his name (with a "W", rather than a "V") from Cyrillic - see Schein 1981.</ref> in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1952,<ref>First a short announcement in Wagner 1952, then a much more comprehensive exposition in Wagner 1953.</ref> and by [[Gordon Preston]] in [[Great Britain]] in 1954.<ref>Preston 1954a,b,c.</ref> Both authors arrived at inverse semigroups via the study of partial one-one transformations of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]: a [[partial function|partial transformation]] α of a set ''X'' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from ''A'' to ''B'', where ''A'' and ''B'' are subsets of ''X''. Let α and β be partial transformations of a set ''X''; α and β can be composed (from left to right) on the largest [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] upon which it "makes sense" to compose them: :dom &alpha;&beta; = [im &alpha; <math>\cap</math> dom &beta;]&alpha;<sup>&minus;1</sup> where α<sup>&minus;1</sup> denotes the [[preimage]] under α. Partial transformations had already been studied in the context of [[pseudogroup]]s.<ref>See, for example, Golab 1939.</ref> It was Wagner, however, who was the first to observe that the composition of partial transformations is a special case of the multiplication of [[binary relations]].<ref>Schein 2002 : 152.</ref> He recognised also that the domain of composition of two partial transformations may be the [[empty set]], so he introduced an ''empty transformation'' to take account of this. With the addition of this empty transformation, the composition of partial transformations of a set becomes an everywhere-defined [[associative]] [[binary operation]]. Under this composition, the collection <math>\mathcal{I}_X</math> of all partial one-one transformations of a set ''X'' forms an inverse semigroup, called the ''symmetric inverse semigroup'' (or monoid) on ''X''.<ref>Howie 1995 : 149.</ref> This is the "archetypal" inverse semigroup, in the same way that a [[symmetric group]] is the archetypal [[group (mathematics)|group]].
