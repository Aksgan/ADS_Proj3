in <math>p(x)</math> by taking greatest common divisors with its derivative. Next we write <math>L= K[x]/p(x)</math> explicitly as an algebra over <math>\mathbb{Q}</math>. We next pick a random element <math>\alpha \in L</math>. By the primitive element theorem, <math>\alpha</math> generates <math>L</math> over <math>\mathbb{Q}</math> with high probability. If this is the case, we can compute the minimal polynomial, <math>q(y)\in \mathbb{Q}[y]</math> of <math>\alpha</math> over <math>\mathbb{Q}</math>. Factoring :<math>q(y) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} q_i(y)</math> over <math>\mathbb{Q}[y]</math>, we determine that :<math>L = \mathbb{Q}[\alpha] = \mathbb{Q}[y]/q(y) = \prod_{i=1}^n \mathbb{Q}[y]/q_i(y)</math> (notice that <math>L</math> is reduced since <math>p(x)</math> is), where <math>\alpha</math> corresponds to the element <math>(y,y,\ldots,y)</math>. Note that this is the unique decomposition of <math>L</math> as a product fields. Hence this decomposition is the same as :<math>\prod_{i=1}^m K[x]/p_i(x)</math> where :<math>p(x) = \prod_{i=1}^m p_i(x)</math> is the factorization of <math>p(x)</math> over <math>K[x]</math>. By writing <math>x\in L</math> and generators of <math>K</math> as a polynomials in <math>\alpha</math>, we can determine the embeddings of <math>x</math> and <math>K</math> into the components <math>\mathbb{Q}[y]/q_i(y)=K[x]/p_i(x)</math>. By finding the minimal polynomial of <math>x</math> in this ring, we have computed <math>p_i(x)</math>, and thus factored <math>p(x)</math> over <math>K.</math> ==Bibliography== * {{cite journal|title=Quantitative Estimates for Polynomials in One or Several Variables: From Analysis and Number Theory to Symbolic and Massively Parallel Computation |author=Bernard Beauzamy, [[Per Enflo]], Paul Wang |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=67 |issue=4 |month=October |year=1994 |pages=243–257 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2690843|ref=harv}} (accessible to readers with undergraduate mathematics) *{{Cite book | last1=Cohen | first1=Henri | title=A course in computational algebraic number theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-55640-4 | id={{MathSciNet | id = 1228206}} | year=1993 | volume=138 | ref=harv | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

FairPlay is built into the [[QuickTime]] multimedia software and used by the [[iPhone]], [[iPod]], [[iPad]], [[Apple TV]], [[iTunes]], and [[iTunes Store]] and the [[App Store]]. Any protected song or other form of media purchased from the iTunes Store with iTunes is encoded with FairPlay. FairPlay digitally [[encryption|encrypts]] [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio files and prevents users from playing these files on unauthorized computers. The majority of FairPlay-encrypted content is purchased through the iTunes Store, using the iTunes software. The iTunes software relies on Apple's Quicktime multimedia software for decoding and playback of the encrypted files. Every media player capable of using QuickTime is capable of playing back FairPlay-encrypted files, including [[RealPlayer]], [[Media Center (software application)|Media Center]], [[Media Player Classic]] and [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]].<ref>[http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addon/23"Songbird"]</ref> ==How it works== FairPlay-protected files are regular [[MPEG-4 Layer 14|MP4]] container files with an encrypted [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio stream. The audio stream is encrypted using the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] algorithm in combination with [[MD5]] hashes. The master key required to decrypt the encrypted audio stream is also stored in encrypted form in the MP4 container file. The key required to decrypt the master key is called the "user key". Each time a new customer uses iTunes to buy a track a new random user key is generated and used to encrypt the master key. The random user key is stored, together with the account information, on Apple’s servers, and also sent to iTunes. iTunes stores these keys in its own encrypted key repository. Using this key repository, iTunes is able to retrieve the user key required to decrypt the master key. Using the master key, iTunes is able to decrypt the AAC audio stream and play it. When a user authorizes a new computer, iTunes sends a unique machine identifier to Apple’s servers. In return it receives all the user keys that are stored with the account information. This ensures that Apple is able to limit the number of computers that are authorized and makes sure that each authorized computer has all the user keys that are needed to play the tracks that it bought. When a user deauthorizes a computer, iTunes will instruct Apple’s servers to remove the unique machine identifier from their database, and at the same time it will remove all the user keys from its encrypted key repository. The iPod also has its own encrypted key repository. Every time a FairPlay-protected track is copied onto the iPod, iTunes will copy the user key from its own key repository to the key repository on the iPod. This makes sure that the iPod has everything it needs to play the encrypted AAC audio stream. FairPlay does not affect the ability of the file itself to be copied. It only manages the decryption of the audio content. ==Restrictions== FairPlay-encrypted audio tracks allow the following: * The track may be copied to any number of [[iPod]] portable music players (including the [[iPhone]]).<ref name=authorize>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/store/authorization/ |title=Apple - Support - iTunes Store - Authorization FAQ |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> (However, each iPod/iPhone can only have tracks from a maximum of five different iTunes accounts) * The track may be played on up to five (originally three) authorized computers simultaneously.<ref name=authorize /> * A particular playlist within [[iTunes]] containing a FairPlay-encrypted track can be copied to a CD only up to seven times (originally ten
