as [[duties]] and [[brokerage]]. Some services such as the Canadian based [[Wishabi]] attempts to include estimates of these additional cost,<ref name="ecommercetimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/69105.html|title=Keeping It Real for Cross-Border Online Shoppers|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref> but nevertheless, the lack of general full cost disclosure remains a concern. ===Privacy=== Privacy of personal information is a significant issue for some consumers. Different legal jurisdictions have different laws concerning consumer privacy, and different levels of enforcement. Many consumers wish to avoid spam and telemarketing which could result from supplying contact information to an online merchant. In response, many merchants promise not to use consumer information for these purposes, or provide a mechanism to opt-out of such contacts. Many websites keep track of consumers shopping habits in order to suggest items and other websites to view. Brick-and-mortar stores also collect consumer information. Some ask for address and phone number at checkout, though consumers may refuse to provide it. Many larger stores use the address information encoded on consumers' credit cards (often without their knowledge) to add them to a catalog mailing list. This information is obviously not accessible to the merchant when paying in cash. ==Product suitability== Many successful purely [[virtual shopping|virtual]] companies deal with digital products, (including information storage, retrieval, and modification), music, movies, office supplies, education, communication, software, photography, and financial transactions. Other successful marketers use [[Drop shipping]] or [[affiliate marketing]] techniques to facilitate transactions of tangible goods without maintaining real inventory. Some non-digital products have been more successful than others for online stores. Profitable items often have a high value-to-weight ratio, they may involve embarrassing purchases, they may typically go to people in remote locations, and they may have shut-ins as their typical purchasers. Items which can fit in a standard mailbox — such as music CDs, DVDs and books — are particularly suitable for a virtual marketer. Products such as spare parts, both for consumer items like washing machines and for industrial equipment like centrifugal pumps, also seem good candidates for selling online. Retailers often need to order spare parts specially, since they typically do not stock them at consumer outlets—in such cases, e-commerce solutions in spares do not compete with retail stores, only with other ordering systems. A factor for success in this niche can consist of providing customers with exact, reliable information about which part number their particular version of a product needs, for example by providing parts lists keyed by serial number. Products less suitable for e-commerce include products that have a low value-to-weight ratio, products that have a smell, taste, or touch component, products that need trial fittings — most notably clothing — and products where colour integrity appears important. Nonetheless, [[Tesco|Tesco.com]] has had success delivering groceries in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], albeit that many of its goods are of a generic quality, and clothing sold through the internet is big business in the U.S. Also, the recycling program [[Cheapcycle]] sells goods over the internet, but avoids the low value-to-weight ratio problem by creating different groups for various regions, so that shipping costs remain low. ==Aggregation== High-volume websites, such as [[Yahoo!]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]], offer hosting services for online stores to all size retailers. These stores are presented within an integrated navigation framework. Collections of online stores are sometimes known as [[virtual shopping mall]]s or [[online marketplace]]s. [[Become.com]] is a product price comparison service and discovery shopping search engine with a mission to help shoppers make ideal buying decisions. [[Dulance]] was a price engine that specialized in searching for hard-to-find products often sold by small independent online retailers ("[[The Long Tail]]"). [[Mysupermarket]] aggregates inventory from the UK's four leading online groceries for shoppers to compare supermarket prices. Many companies that don't have internal resources or expertise (such as do-it-yourself-ers) work with a web development firm to handle all or some of the facets of the online shopping set-up, including integration of the e-commerce platform and hosting. Full service digital companies can design, develop and set-up ecommerce sites so that they're up and running with existing merchant accounts or new ones." ==The impact of others’ review on consumer behaviour== One of the great benefits of online shopping is the ability to read others’ reviews, which could be from experts or simply fellow shoppers on one product and service. [[The Nielsen Company]] conducted a survey in March 2010 and polled more than 27,000 [[Internet]] users in 55 markets from the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North America and South America to look at questions such as “How do consumers shop online?”, “What do they intend to buy?”, “How do they use various online shopping web pages?”, and the impact of [[social media]] and other factors that come into play when consumers are trying to decide how to spend their money on which product or service. According to that research<ref name="Nielson">Nielsen, “Online Shopping Trends”, (USA: The Nielsen Company, 2010)</ref>, reviews on electronics (57%) such as DVD players, cell phones or PlayStations and so on, reviews on cars (45%), and reviews on software (37%) play an important role and have influence on consumers who tend to make purchases and buy online. In addition to online reviews, peer recommendations on the online shopping pages or social media play a key role for online shoppers while researching future purchases of electronics, cars and travel or concert bookings. On the other hand, according to the same research<ref name="Nielson"/>, 40% of online shoppers indicate that they would not even buy electronics without consulting online reviews first. Online reviews play a fundamental role on consumers who want to buy some kind of product, but the biggest effect is seen for electronics, cars and software. ==See also== *[[Bricks and clicks business model]] *[[Electronic business]] *[[Electronic commerce]] *[[Direct Imports]] *[[List of Open Source eCommerce Software]] *[[Online auction business model]] *[[Online music store]] *[[Online shopping rewards]] *[[Open catalogue]] *[[Retail therapy]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Online Shopping}} [[Category:Electronic commerce]] [[Category:Online retailers]] [[ar:تسوق عبر الإنترنت]] [[bg:Интернет магазин]] [[cs:Internetový obchod]] [[da:Webshop]] [[el:Ηλεκτρονικά καταστήματα]] [[es:Tienda en línea]] [[fa:خرید اینترنتی]] [[id:Belanja daring]] [[is:Vefverslun]] [[ms:Membeli-belah dalam talian]] [[nl:Webwinkel]] [[ja:電子商店街]] [[ko:온라인 쇼핑]] [[no:Nettbutikk]] [[pl:Sklep internetowy]] [[ru:Интернет-магазин]]
