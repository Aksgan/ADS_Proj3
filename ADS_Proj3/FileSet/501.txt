was used as a basis for the [[POSIX]] shell standard. A newer version, ksh93, has been open source since 2000 and is used on some Linux distributions. There is also a clone of ksh88 known as [[pdksh]], and this is the default shell for all users of OpenBSD. [[rc]] was created at [[Bell Labs]] by [[Tom Duff]] as a replacement for sh for [[Version 10 Unix]]. It is the default shell for [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]]. It has been ported to UNIX as part of [[Plan 9 from User Space]]. [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], also known as the ''Bourne-Again shell'', was later developed for the [[GNU|GNU project]] and takes features from the Bourne shell, csh and ksh. Due to copyright issues surrounding the Bourne Shell as it was used in historic [[Computer Systems Research Group|CSRG]] BSD releases, Kenneth Almquist developed a clone of the Bourne Shell, known by some as the [[Almquist Shell]] and available under the [[BSD license]], which is in use today on some BSD descendants and in low-memory situations. The Almquist Shell was ported to Linux, and the port renamed the [[Debian Almquist shell]], or dash. This shell provides much faster execution of standard <tt>sh</tt> scripts with a smaller memory footprint than its more common counterpart, bash. Its use tends to expose [[Bash (Unix shell)#Portability|bashisms]] - bash-centric assumptions made in scripts meant to run on sh. ==Usage== The Bourne shell was once standard on all branded [[Unix]] systems, although historically [[BSD]]-based systems had many scripts written in [[C shell|csh]]. Bourne shell scripts can typically be run with [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] or [[Debian Almquist shell|dash]] on [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] or other [[Unix-like]] systems. ==Quotes== {{quotation|"Nobody really knows what the Bourne shell's grammar is.

The bootstrap was one of the first computer-intensive statistical techniques, replacing traditional [[algebra]]ic derivations with data-based computer simulations. ==Life and career== Efron was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in May 1938, the son of [[Russia]]n [[Jew]]ish immigrants Esther and Miles Efron.<ref>http://www.ams.org/meetings/national/jmm/2098_intro.html</ref> He attended the [[California Institute of Technology]], graduating in Mathematics in 1960. He arrived at [[Stanford]] in fall of 1960, earning his Ph.D., under the direction of Rupert Miller and Herb Solomon, in the Department of Statistics. While at Stanford, he was suspended for a year for his involvement with the [[Stanford Chaparral]]'s parody of [[Playboy magazine]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf0f59n4t0&chunk.id=bioghist-1.8.3&brand=oac| title = Guide to the Hammer and Coffin Society Records, 1906-1987| publisher = Online Archive of California}}</ref> He is currently a Professor of Statistics at Stanford. At Stanford he has been the Chair of the Department of Statistics, Associate Dean of Science, Chairman of the University Advisory Board, Chair of the Faculty Senate and Chair of the Undergraduate Program in [[Applied Mathematics]]. Efron holds the Max H. Stein endowed chair as Professor of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford. He has made many important contributions to many areas of statistics. Efron's work has spanned both theoretical and applied topics, including empirical Bayes analysis (with [[Carl Morris (statistician)|Carl Morris]]), applications of [[differential geometry]] to [[statistical inference]], the analysis of survival data, and inference for microarray gene expression data. He is the author of a classic monograph, ''The Jackknife, the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans'' (1982) and has also co-authored (with R. Tibshirani) the text ''An Introduction to the Bootstrap'' (1994). He created a set of [[nontransitive dice]] called [[Efron's dice]]. ==Awards== He has won many honors, including a [[MacArthur Prize Fellowship]], membership in the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], fellowship in the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] (IMS) and the [[American Statistical Association]] (ASA), the Wilks Medal, the Parzen Prize, and the Rao Prize, Fisher, Rietz and Wald lecturer. In 2005, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]], the highest scientific honor by the United States, for his exceptional work in the field of Statistics (especially for his inventing of the bootstrapping methodology).<ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=5300000000429 National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]</ref> He was presented with the award on May 29, 2007.<ref>http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/2005nmslaureates_pressrelease.pdf</ref> ==Works== * {{cite journal |last1=Efron |first1=B. <!-- |authorlink1=Bradley Efron --> |last2=Hinkley |first2=D.V. |authorlink2=David V.
