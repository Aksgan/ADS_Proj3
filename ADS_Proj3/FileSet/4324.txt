have no ability to describe themselves. That which is, is. With respect to nature, conceptual systems are merely models that humans create in an attempt to understand the environment in which they live. The system model is used because it more accurately describes the observations. Because systems are [[model (abstract)|models]] created only for understanding, the most fundamental [[property]] of any [[system]] is that a system has an arbitrary boundary. Humans create the boundaries to suit their own purposes of analysis, discussion and understanding. This is true of every conceptual model that was devised through which humans try to understand the [[universe]]. [[Arbitrary]] does not mean random or meaningless. Arbitrary merely means without previous dependency. We assume that the Universe is objective, but our experience is tempered by our subjective understanding. We see what we look at. Systems are further expressed by listing the [[wiktionary:element|elements]] relationships, wholes, and [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] associated with that system. Again, this is an arbitrary exercise true of all models humans create. What are system elements? Elements might be [[tangible]] or [[intangible]], [[The Real|real]] or [[imaginary]]. Conceptually, elements are merely terms and definitions. For example, in the system or model of measurement, the [[arbitrary]] terms of [[height]], [[width]], and [[length]] describe the three dimensions of [[space|physical space]]. Additional elements of that system describe those three fundamental elements: [[inches]], [[Foot (length)|feet]], [[meters]], [[kilometers]], etc. However, those elements are meaningless without [[definitions]]. Definitions are necessary for all terms, whether or not those terms represent tangible or intangible elements. Definitions and terms are added as necessary to help understand any model. Relationships are ontologically different from elements, just as the meaning of these words differ from the letters making it up, an element is a thing, a relationship is what a thing is doing. The relationship constrains the system into having at least two elements. Often the relationship has an emergent property, and in most cases these elements and relationships emerge as a whole. A systemic whole is directly related to the relationships of elements, in that our experience of such a relationship is as a whole. One of the significant characteristics of a system of this type is that there are properties of the whole that cannot be found in the elements. Meaning, for example, is not found in the properties of these letters you are reading. A rule is anything describing how the elements are related or behave dynamically. Rules describe how a system functions. Rules describe how system elements interact, and those original arbitrary boundaries establish finite limits of how the rules affect the elements. Inches and feet, or meters and kilometers, are elements of the system of measurement, but the relationship of those elements are rules. There are twelve inches in a foot, 1,000 meters in a kilometer, etc. A system with no elements and no rules—boundaries only—is called a null system. Change any boundary, element, or rule in any system and a completely new system appears. Observations made in one system might, or might not, hold true for a different system. == References == * Laszlo, Ervin, ''Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought''.

The basic idea of a [[system theory]] in [[social science]] is to solve the classical problem of duality; mind-body, subject-object, form-content, signifier-signified, and structure-agency. System theory, therefore, suggests that instead of creating closed categories into binaries (subject-object); the system should stay open so as to allow free flow of process and interactions. In this way the binaries are dissolved. Complex systems in nature—for example, ecosystems—involve a dynamic interaction of many variables (e.g. animals, plants, insects and bacteria; predators and prey; climate, the seasons and the weather, etc.) These interactions can adapt to changing conditions but maintain a balance both between the various parts and as a whole; this balance is maintained through [[homeostasis]]. <br /> Human societies are complex systems, as it were, human ecosystems. Early humans, as hunter-gatherers, recognized and worked within the parameters of the complex systems in nature and their lives were circumscribed by the realities of nature. But they couldn't explain complex systems. Only in recent centuries did the need arise to define complex systems scientifically. <br /> [[Complex systems]] theories first developed in math in the late 19th century, then in biology in the 1920s to explain ecosystems, then to deal with artificial intelligence ([[cybernetics]]), etc.<br /> Anthropologist, [[Gregory Bateson]] is the most influential and earliest founder of system theory in social sciences. In the 1940s, as a result of the Macy conferences, he immediately recognized its application to human societies with their many variables and the flexible but sustainable balance that they maintain. Bateson describes system as “any unit containing feedback structure and therefore competent to process information.”<ref>Gregory Bateson, A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 260.</ref> Thus an open system allows interaction between concepts and materiality or subject and the environment or abstract and real. In natural science, systems theory has been a widely used approach. Austrian biologist, [[Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], developed the idea of the [[General Systems Theory]] (GST). The GST is a
