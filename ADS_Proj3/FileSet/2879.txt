* In its current form, Mesa 3D is available and can be compiled on virtually all modern platforms. * Though not an official OpenGL implementation for licensing reasons, the Mesa 3D authors have worked to keep the API in line with the most current OpenGL standards and conformance tests, as set forth by the [[OpenGL Architecture Review Board]]. * Whilst Mesa 3D supports several hardware graphics accelerators, it may also be compiled as a software-only renderer. Since it is also free/open source software, it is possible to use it to study the internal workings of an [[OpenGL]]-compatible renderer. * It is sometimes possible to find subtle bugs in OpenGL applications by linking against Mesa 3D and using a conventional debugger to track problems into the lower level library. * Already supports (at least partially) 3D acceleration managed cards : ATI Mach 64 and r100 to r800 chipsets, Intel chipsets, IBM/Toshiba/Sony Cell chip (in [[Gallium3D]] architecture) used in Sony PlayStation 3, limited Nvidia support, S3 Virge & Savage chipsets, VIA chipsets, Matrox G200 & G400 and more...<ref>[http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/Status Direct Rendering Infrastructure Status Page] on freedesktop.org</ref>. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Gallium3D]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.mesa3d.org/ Mesa 3D website] {{Freedesktop.org}} {{Use dmy dates|date=November 2010}} <!-- Interlang --> {{DEFAULTSORT:Mesa 3d (Opengl)}} <!-- Categories --> [[Category:Free software programmed in C]] [[Category:Free system software]] [[Category:Freedesktop.org]] [[Category:OpenGL]] [[Category:Free development toolkits and libraries]] [[Category:Software using the MIT license]] [[cs:Mesa 3D]] [[de:Mesa 3D]] [[es:Mesa 3D]] [[fr:Mesa (OpenGL)]] [[it:Mesa 3D]] [[ja:Mesa 3D]] [[pl:Mesa 3D]] [[pt:Mesa 3D]] [[ru:Mesa]] [[zh:Mesa 3D]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24122</id> <title>Mesh networking</title> <text>{{cleanup|date=September 2009}} [[File:Partial Mesh Diagram.svg|thumb|a diagram of a typical Partial Mesh Topology Network]] [[Image:NetworkTopology-Mesh.png|thumb|Image showing mesh network layout]] [[Image:Self-form-self-heal.gif|thumb|Animation showing self healing wireless mesh ([[:Image:Self-form-self-heal.gif|enlarge]]<!--or should it be a direct media: link-->)]] '''Mesh networking''' is a type of networking where each node must not only capture and disseminate its own data, but also serve as a ''relay'' for other sensor nodes, that is, it must collaborate to propagate the data in the network. A mesh network can be designed using a ''flooding'' technique or a ''routing'' technique. When using a routing technique, the message propagates along a path, by ''hoping'' from node to node until the destination is reached. For insuring all its paths availability, a routing network must allow for continuous connections and reconfiguration around broken or blocked paths, using ''self-healing'' algorithms. A mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a [[fully connected network]]. Mesh networks can be seen as one type of ad hoc network. [[Mobile ad hoc network]]s (MANET) and mesh networks are therefore closely related, but MANET also have to deal with the problems introduced by the mobility of the nodes. The self-healing capability enables a routing based network to operate when one node breaks down or a connection goes bad. As a result, the network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network. Although mostly used in wireless scenarios, this concept is also applicable to wired networks and software interaction. The animation at the right illustrates how wireless mesh networks can self form and self heal. For more animations see [[History of wireless mesh networking|History of Wireless Mesh Networking]] [[Wireless mesh networks]] were originally developed for military applications and are typical of mesh architectures. Over the past decade the size, cost, and power requirements of radios has declined, enabling more radios to be included within each device acting as a mesh node. The additional radios within each node enable it to support multiple functions such as client access, backhaul service, and scanning (required for high speed handover in mobile applications). Additionally, the reduction in radio size, cost, and power has enabled the mesh nodes to become more modularâ€”one node or device now can contain multiple radio cards or modules, allowing the nodes to be customized to handle a unique set of functions and frequency bands. Work in this field has been aided by the use of [[game theory]] methods to analyze strategies for the allocation of resources and routing of packets.<ref>J. Huang, D. P. Palomar, N. Mandayam, J.
