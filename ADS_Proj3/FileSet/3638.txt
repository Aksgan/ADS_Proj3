inspired by the need for interoperability in question design, and to avoid people losing or having to re-type questions when technology changes. Developing and validating good questions is time consuming, and it's desirable to be able to create them in a platform and technology neutral format. QTI version 1.0 was materially based on a proprietary [[Questions Markup Language]] (QML) language defined by [[QuestionMark]], but the language has evolved over the years and can now describe almost any reasonable question that one might want to describe. (QML is still in use by Questionmark and is generated for interoperability by tools like Adobe [[Captivate]]). The most widely used version of QTI at the time of writing is version 1.2, which was finalized in 2002. This works well for exchanging simple question types, and is supported by many tools that allow the creation of questions. Version 2.0 was released in 2005, with v2.1 due for release in 2008<ref>[http://wiki.cetis.ac.uk/Assessment_and_EC_SIGs_meeting_Feb_2008#QTI_Update QTI Update]</ref>. 2.0 addressed the item (individual question) level of the specification only, with 2.1 covering assessments and results as well as correcting errors which had become apparent in 2.0. Version 2.x is a significant improvement on earlier versions, defining a new underlying [[Interaction Model | interaction model]]. It is also notable for its significantly greater degree of integration with other specifications (some of which did not exist during the production of v1): the specification addresses the relationship with IMS [[content package | Content Packaging]] v1.2, IEEE [[Learning Object Metadata]], [[IMS Learning Design]], [[IMS Simple Sequencing]] and other standards such as [[XHTML]]. It also provides guidance on representing context-specific usage data and information to support the migration of content from earlier versions of the specification. Because v2.0 was limited to items only, and v2.1 has yet to be formally released by IMS (although two public drafts plus an addendum are currently available), uptake of v2.x has been slow to date. The delay between the release of 2.0 and 2.1 (over three years to date) may have hindered uptake to some extent, with developers reluctant to commit to v2.0 knowing that v2.1 is in development. The use of a profile of v1.2.1 in the IMS [[Common_cartridge#Common_Cartridge | Common Cartridge]] specification may exacerbate this. A number of implementations are emerging, however, and uptake may increase once the specification is finally available in a stable form. In early 2009, the IMS Global Learning Consortium withdrew QTI 2.1, stating that "Adequate feedback on the specification has not been received, and therefore, the specification has been put back into the IMS project group process for further work."<ref>IMS Global Learning Consortium: [http://www.imsglobal.org/question/index.html IMS Question & Test Interoperability Specification]. Accessed March 29, 2009.</ref> The most recent version of QTI that is fully endorsed by IMS GLC is v1.2.1.
