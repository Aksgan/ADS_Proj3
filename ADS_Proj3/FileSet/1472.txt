some bird species on islands. Feral cats are seen as vermin to many farmers and gamekeepers. The feral cats will catch and eat the ground nesting birds eg: pheasants and partrige. Gamekeepers often set traps and shoot the feral cats as part of pest control on their estate as a way of protecting their birds{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}. ===Australia=== Numerous Australian environmentalists claim the feral cat has been an ecological disaster in Australia, inhabiting most ecosystems except dense [[rainforest]], and being implicated in the [[extinction]] of several [[marsupial]] and [[placental]] mammal [[species]].<ref name=re>Robley, A., Reddiex, B., Arthur T., Pech R., and Forsyth, D., (2004). "Interactions between feral cats, foxes, native carnivores, and rabbits in Australia". [[Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research]], Department of Sustainability and Environment, Melbourne.</ref> But scientific evidence supporting this view has been hard to come by, and some researchers disagree with it (Abbot 2002). There is little sound evidence that feral cats significantly affect native wildlife throughout the mainland (Jones 1989; Wilson et al. 1992).<ref name=dc/> Difficulties in separating the effects of cats from that of [[fox]]es (also introduced) and environmental effects have hindered research into this. Cats have co-existed with all mammal species in Tasmania for nearly 200 years.<ref name="Abbot" /> The Western Shield program in Western Australia, involving broad-scale poisoning of foxes, has resulted in rapid recoveries of many species of native mammals in spite of the presence of feral cats throughout the baited area.<ref name="Abbot" /> In 2005, however, a study was published which for the first time found proof of feral cats causing declines in native mammals.<ref>Risbey, Danielle A. ; Calver, Michael C. ; Short, Jeff ; Bradley J.

A field experiment] ''Wildlife Research'' '''27'''(3): 223-235</ref> An [[experiment]] conducted in Heirisson Prong (Western Australia) compared small mammal populations in areas cleared of both foxes and cats, of foxes only, and a control plot. Researchers found mammal populations were lower in areas cleared of foxes only and in the control plots. Cats may also play a further role in Australia's human altered ecosystems; with foxes they may be controlling introduced [[rabbit]]s, particularly in arid areas, which themselves cause ecological damage.<ref name=re/> Cats are not believed to have been a factor in the extinction of the only mainland [[bird]] species to be lost since European settlement, the [[paradise parrot]]. Australian folklore holds that some feral cats in Australia have grown so large as to cause inexperienced observers to claim sightings of other species such as [[Cougar|puma]] etc. This folklore is being shown to be more fact than fiction, with the recent shooting of an enormous feline,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wherelightmeetsdark.com/index.php?module=wiki&page=EngelGippslandBigCat |title=Engel Gippsland big cat |accessdate= 2008-05-02}}</ref> in the [[Gippsland]] area of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Subsequent [[DNA test]] showed the feline to be ''[[Felis silvestris catus]]''.<ref>[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/03/australias_new_feral_mega_cats.php#more "Feral Mega Cats"]</ref> Subsequent news of large feral cat sightings appear almost monthly in Australia, and the evidence is very good to suggest a breeding population of these enormous felines in the south-eastern states Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref>[http://www.strangenation.com.au/Articles/paulclacher.htm The Big Cat Files]</ref> ===New Zealand=== The fauna of [[New Zealand]] has evolved in isolation for millions of years without the presence of mammals (apart from a few bat species). Consequently, birds dominated the niches occupied by mammals and many became flightless. The introduction of mammals after settlement by [[MƒÅori]] from about the 12th century had a huge effect on the indigenous [[biodiversity]]. [[Europe]]an explorers and settlers brought cats on their ships and the presence of feral cats were recorded from the latter decades of the 19th century.<ref>King, Carolyn; (1984) Immigrant Killers. Auckland: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-558121-0</ref> It is estimated that feral cats have been responsible for the extinction of six endemic bird species and over 70 localised subspecies as well as depleting bird and lizard species.<ref>{{Cite conference | coauthors = Charles T.

(Island restoration involves the removal of introduced species and reintroducing native species). As of 2004, 48 islands have had their feral cat populations removed, including [[New Zealand]]'s network of offshore island bird reserves,<ref>Nogales, Manuel ''et al.''
