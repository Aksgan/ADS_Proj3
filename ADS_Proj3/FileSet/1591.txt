open ball centered at 0 with radius ''r'', which, since ''r'' > ''R'', is the total number of zeros of ''p''(''z''). On the other hand, the integral of ''n''/''z'' along ''c''(''r'') divided by 2π''i'' is equal to ''n''. But the difference between the two numbers is :<math>\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c(r)}\left(\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}-\frac{n}{z}\right)dz=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c(r)}\frac{zp'(z)-np(z)}{zp(z)}\,dz.</math> The numerator of the rational expression being integrated has degree at most ''n'' − 1 and the degree of the denominator is ''n'' + 1. Therefore, the number above tends to 0 as ''r'' tends to +∞. But the number is also equal to ''N'' − ''n'' and so ''N'' = ''n''. '''Still another''' complex-analytic proof can be given by combining [[linear algebra]] with the [[Cauchy theorem]]. To establish that every complex polynomial of degree ''n'' > 0 has a zero, it suffices to show that every complex square matrix of size ''n'' > 0 has a (complex) [[eigenvalue]].<ref>A proof of the fact that this suffices can be seen [[Algebraically closed field#Every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvector|here]].</ref> The proof of the latter statement is [[Proof by contradiction|by contradiction]]. Let ''A'' be a complex square matrix of size ''n'' > 0 and let ''I<sub>n</sub>'' be the unit matrix of the same size. Assume ''A'' has no eigenvalues. Consider the [[resolvent]] function :<math> R(z)=(zI_n-A)^{-1},\,</math> which is a [[meromorphic function]] on the complex plane with values in the vector space of matrices. The eigenvalues of ''A'' are precisely the poles of ''R(z)''. Since, by assumption, ''A'' has no eigenvalues, the function ''R(z)'' is an [[entire function]] and [[Cauchy's theorem]] implies that :<math> \int_{c(r)} R(z) dz =0.\,</math> On the other hand, ''R(z)'' expanded as a geometric series gives: :<math>R(z)=z^{-1}(I_n-z^{-1}A)^{-1}=z^{-1}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{z^k}A^k\cdot</math> This formula is valid outside the closed [[disc (mathematics)|disc]] of radius ||''A''|| (the [[operator norm]] of ''A''). Let ''r'' > ||''A''||. Then :<math>\int_{c(r)}R(z)dz=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\int_{c(r)}\frac{dz}{z^{k+1}}A^k=2\pi iI_n</math> (in which only the summand ''k'' = 0 has a nonzero integral). This is a contradiction, and so ''A'' has an eigenvalue. ===Topological proofs=== Let ''z''<sub>0</sub> ∈ '''C''' be such that the minimum of |''p''(''z'')| on the whole complex plane is achieved at ''z''<sub>0</sub>; it was seen at the proof which uses Liouville's theorem that such a number must exist. We can write ''p''(''z'') as a polynomial in ''z'' − ''z''<sub>0</sub>: there is some natural number ''k'' and there are some complex numbers ''c<sub>k</sub>'', ''c''<sub>''k'' + 1</sub>, ..., ''c<sub>n</sub>'' such that ''c<sub>k</sub>'' ≠ 0 and that :<math>p(z)=p(z_0)+c_k(z-z_0)^k+c_{k+1}(z-z_0)^{k+1}+ \cdots +c_n(z-z_0)^n.</math> It follows that if ''a'' is a ''k''<sup>th</sup> root of −''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>)/''c<sub>k</sub>'' and if ''t'' is positive and sufficiently small, then |''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub> + ''ta'')| < |''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>)|, which is impossible, since |''p''(''z''<sub>0</sub>)| is the minimum of |''p''| on ''D''. For another topological proof by contradiction, suppose that ''p''(''z'') has no zeros. Choose a large positive number ''R'' such that, for |''z''| = ''R'', the leading term ''z<sup>n</sup>'' of ''p''(''z'') dominates all other terms combined; in other words, such that |''z''|<sup>''n''</sup> > |''a''<sub>''n'' − 1</sub>''z''<sup>''n'' −1</sup> + ··· + ''a''<sub>0</sub>|. As ''z'' traverses the circle given by the equation |''z''| = ''R'' once counter-clockwise, ''p''(''z''), like ''z<sup>n</sup>'', winds ''n'' times counter-clockwise around 0. At the other extreme, with |''z''| = 0, the “curve” ''p''(''z'') is simply the single (nonzero) point ''p''(0), whose [[winding number]] is clearly 0. If the loop followed by ''z'' is [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] between these extremes, the path of ''p''(''z'') also deforms continuously. We can explicitly write such a deformation as <math>H(Re^{i\theta},t)=p((1-t)Re^{i\theta})</math> where ''t'' is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. If one views the variable ''t'' as time, then at time zero the curve is ''p(z)'' and at time one the curve is ''p(0)''. Clearly at every point ''t'', ''p(z)'' cannot be zero by the original assumption, therefore during the deformation, the curve never crosses zero. Therefore the winding number of the curve around zero should never change. However, given that the winding number started as ''n'' and ended as 0, this is absurd. Therefore, ''p''(''z'') has at least one zero. ===Algebraic proofs=== These proofs use two facts about real numbers that require only a small amount of analysis (more precisely, the [[intermediate value theorem]]): * every polynomial with odd degree and real coefficients has some real root; * every non-negative real number has a square root. The second fact, together with the [[quadratic formula]], implies the theorem for real quadratic polynomials. In other words, algebraic proofs of the fundamental theorem actually show that if ''R'' is any [[real-closed field]], then its extension <math>\scriptstyle C = R ( \sqrt{-1} )</math> is algebraically closed. As mentioned above, it suffices to check the statement “every non-constant polynomial ''p''(''z'') with real coefficients has a complex root”. This statement can be proved by induction on the greatest non-negative integer ''k'' such that 2<sup>''k''</sup> divides the degree ''n'' of ''p''(''z''). Let ''a'' be the coefficient of ''z<sup>n</sup>'' in ''p''(''z'') and let ''F'' be a [[splitting field]] of ''p''(''z'') over ''C''; in other words, the field ''F'' contains ''C'' and there are elements ''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''z''<sub>n</sub> in ''F'' such that :<math>p(z)=a(z-z_1)(z-z_2) \cdots (z-z_n).</math> If ''k'' = 0, then ''n'' is odd, and therefore ''p''(''z'') has a real root. Now, suppose that ''n'' = 2''<sup>k</sup>m'' (with ''m'' odd and ''k'' > 0) and that the theorem is already proved when the degree of the polynomial has the form 2<sup>''k'' − 1</sup>''m''′ with ''m''′ odd. For a real number ''t'', define: :<math>q_t(z)=\prod_{1\le i<j\le n}\left(z-z_i-z_j-tz_iz_j\right).\,</math> Then the coefficients of ''q<sub>t</sub>''(''z'') are [[symmetric polynomial]]s in the ''z<sub>i</sub>'''s with real coefficients. Therefore, they can be expressed as polynomials with real coefficients in the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s, that is, in −''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ..., (−1)''<sup>n</sup>a<sub>n</sub>''. So ''q<sub>t</sub>''(''z'') has in fact ''real'' coefficients. Furthermore, the degree of ''q<sub>t</sub>''(''z'') is ''n''(''n'' − 1)/2 = 2<sup>''k'' − 1</sup>''m''(''n'' − 1), and ''m''(''n'' − 1) is an odd number. So, using the induction hypothesis, ''q<sub>t</sub>'' has at least one complex root; in other words, ''z<sub>i</sub>'' + ''z<sub>j</sub>'' + ''tz<sub>i</sub>z<sub>j</sub>'' is complex for two distinct elements ''i'' and ''j'' from {1,...,''n''}. Since there are more real numbers than pairs (''i'',''j''), one
