above formulation is ''general'' since the [[stress tensor]] i.e. the [[constitutive equation]] of the [[Physical body|elastic body]] has not been made explicit: it is equally valid assuming the [[hypothesis]] of [[linear elasticity]] or the ones of [[Finite strain theory|nonlinear elasticity]]. However, as it would be clear from the following developments, the problem is inherently [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], therefore ''assuming a [[Linear elasticity#Mathematical formulation|linear stress tensor]] does not simplify the problem''. === The form of the stress tensor in the formulation of Signorini and Fichera === The form assumed by [[Antonio Signorini|Signorini]] and [[Gaetano Fichera|Fichera]] for the [[elastic potential energy]] is the following one (as in the previous developments, the [[Einstein notation]] is adopted) :<math>W(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})=a_{ikjh}(\boldsymbol{x})\varepsilon_{ik}\varepsilon_{ik}</math> where *<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{a}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(a_{ikjh}(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math> is the [[elasticity tensor]] *<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u})=\left(\varepsilon_{ik}(\boldsymbol{u})\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_k} + \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i} \right)\right)</math> is the [[Infinitesimal strain#Infinitesimal strain tensor|infinitesimal strain tensor]] The [[Cauchy stress tensor]] has therefore the following form :{{EquationRef|5|(5){{spaces|5}}}}<math>\sigma_{ik}= - \frac{\partial W}{\partial \varepsilon_{ik}} \qquad\text{for } i,k=1,2,3</math> and it is ''[[Linear map|linear]]'' with respect to the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor; however, it is not [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] nor [[Isotropy|isotropic]]. == Solution of the problem == As for the section on the formal statement of the Signorini problem, the contents of this section and the included subsections follow closely the treatment of [[Gaetano Fichera]] in {{Harv|Fichera|1963}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1964b}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1972}} and also {{Harv|Fichera|1995}}: obviously, the exposition focuses on the basics steps of the proof of the existence and uniqueness for the solution of problem {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, {{EquationNote|2|(2)}}, {{EquationNote|3|(3)}}, {{EquationNote|4|(4)}} and {{EquationNote|5|(5)}}, rather than the technical details. === The potential energy === The first step of the analysis of Fichera as well as the first step of the analysis of [[Antonio Signorini]] in {{Harv|Signorini|1959|}} is the analysis of the '''potential energy''', i.e. the following [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] :{{EquationRef|6|(6){{spaces|6}}}}<math>I(\boldsymbol{u})=\int_A W(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})\mathrm{d}x - \int_A u_i f_i\mathrm{d}x - \int_{\partial A\setminus\Sigma}\!\!\!\!\! u_i g_i \mathrm{d}\sigma</math> where '''<math>u</math>''' belongs to the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of '''admissible displacements''' <math>\scriptstyle\mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math> i.e. the set of [[displacement vector]]s satisfying the system of [[boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} or {{EquationNote|4|(4)}}. The meaning of each of the three terms is the following *the first one is the total [[elastic potential energy]] of the [[Physical body|elastic body]] *the second one is the total [[potential energy]] due to the [[body force]]s, for example the [[gravitational force]] *the third one is the potential energy due to [[surface force]]s, for example the [[Force (physics)|force]]s exerted by the [[atmospheric pressure]] {{Harvtxt|Signorini|1959|pp=129–133}} was able to prove that the admissible displacement '''<math>u</math>''' which [[minimum|minimize]] the integral '''<math>I(u)</math>''' is a solution of the problem with ambiguous boundary conditions {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, {{EquationNote|2|(2)}}, {{EquationNote|3|(3)}}, {{EquationNote|4|(4)}} and {{EquationNote|5|(5)}}, provided it is a [[smooth function|<math>C^1</math> function]] [[Distribution (mathematics)#Support of a distribution|supported]] on the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] <math>\scriptstyle \bar A</math> of the set <math>A</math>: however [[Gaetano Fichera]] gave a class of [[counterexample]]s in {{Harv|Fichera|1964b|pp=619–620}} showing that in general, admissible displacements are not [[smooth function]]s of these class. Therefore Fichera tries to minimize the [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{EquationNote|6|(6)}} in a wider [[function space]]: in doing so, he first calculates the [[first variation]] (or [[functional derivative]]) of the given functional in the [[Neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] of the sought minimizing admissible displacement <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{u} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math>, and then requires it to be greather or equal to [[zero]] :<math>\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} I( \boldsymbol{u} + t \boldsymbol{v}) \right\vert_{t=0} = -\int_A \sigma_{ik}(\boldsymbol{u})\varepsilon_{ik}(\boldsymbol{v})\mathrm{d}x - \int_A v_i f_i\mathrm{d}x - \int_{\partial A\setminus\Sigma}\!\!\!\!\! v_i g_i \mathrm{d}\sigma \geq 0 \qquad \forall \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math> Defining the following functionals :<math>B(\boldsymbol{u},\boldsymbol{v}) = -\int_A \sigma_{ik}(\boldsymbol{u})\varepsilon_{ik}(\boldsymbol{v})\mathrm{d}x \qquad \boldsymbol{u},\boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math> and :<math>F(\boldsymbol{v}) = \int_A v_i f_i\mathrm{d}x + \int_{\partial A\setminus\Sigma}\!\!\!\!\! v_i g_i \mathrm{d}\sigma\qquad \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math> the preceding [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] is can be written as :{{EquationRef|7|(7){{spaces|6}}}}<math>B(\boldsymbol{u},\boldsymbol{v}) - F(\boldsymbol{v}) \geq 0 \qquad \forall \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma </math> This inequality is the '''[[variational inequality]] for the Signorini problem'''. == See also == * [[Linear elasticity]] * [[Variational inequality]] == Notes == {{Reflist|2}} == Bibliography == *{{Citation | last = Antman | first = Stuart | author-link = | title = The influence of elasticity in analysis: modern developments | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–291 | date = | year = 1983 | url = http://www.ams.org/bull/1983-09-03/S0273-0979-1983-15185-6/home.html?pagingLink=%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Fjoursearch%2Fservlet%2FDoSearch%3Fco1%3Dand%26co2%3Dand%26co3%3Dand%26cperpage%3D50%26csort%3Dd%26endmo%3D00%26f1%3Dmsc%26f2%3Dtitle%26f3%3Danywhere%26f4%3Dauthor%26format%3Dstandard%26jrnl%3Done%26sendit22%3DSearch%26sperpage%3D30%26ssort%3Dd%26startmo%3D00%26timingString%3DQuery%2Btook%2B71%2Bmilliseconds.%26v4%3DAntman%26onejrnl%3Dbull%26startRec%3D1%22%3E | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-1983-15185-6 | id = {{MathSciNet|714990}}, {{Zbl|0533.73001}} }}. *{{Citation | last = Fichera | first = Gaetano | author-link = Gaetano Fichera | contribution = Boundary value problems of elasticity with unilateral constraints | year = 1972 | title = Festkörpermechanik/Mechanics of Sol | editor-last = Flügge | editor-first = Siegfried | editor-link = Siegfried Flügge | editor2-last = Truesdell | editor2-first = Clifford A. | editor2-link = Clifford Truesdell | series = Handbuch der Physik (Encyclopedia of Physics) | volume = VIa/2 | edition = paperback 1984 | pages = 391–424 | place = [[Berlin]]-[[Heidelberg]]-[[New York]] | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | id = {{Zbl|0277.73001}} | isbn = 3-540-13161-2, ISBN 0-387-13161-2 }}.
