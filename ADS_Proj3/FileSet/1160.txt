rises from 20.44 FTEs before the wage change to 21.03 FTE's after the wage change. Naively, you might interpret this to mean that the minimum wage change caused a 0.59 FTE increase in employment per store. But lots of other things changed. For one thing, we're in a different season; do fast food restaurants face more demand in winter than in spring? For another thing, the macroeconomic conditions may have changed more broadly. Perhaps unemployment is shrinking across the board. Perhaps employment would have gone up by even more in the absence of the minimum wage increase. Card and Krueger need a control group. They turn to fast food restaurants in Pennsylvania, a state that faces very similar macroeconomic conditions. They expect that major changes in the fast food environment in NJ are probably also occurring in PA. In PA, FTE employment actually fell from April to November, from 23.33 to 21.17. If you think fast food restaurants in PA are identical to fast food restaurants in NJ, then you expect NJ restaurants to see a similar &minus;2.16 FTE change in employment. Instead, we see a +0.59 change. So employment in NJ rose by 2.76 FTEs more than we would expect just based on what was happening in PA. That is, we take the difference between Period 1 and Period 2 separately for the treatment and control groups (+0.59 and &minus;2.16). Then we calculate the difference between those two differences (0.59 &minus; (&minus;2.16)) to get the DID estimate. We know one major difference between NJ and PA at the time: the change in the minimum wage. The DID method thus implies that the minimum wage increase appears to have led to a 2.76 increase in FTEs per fast food restaurant. (This is probably not going to convince you that raising the minimum wage raises employment, but at the very least it strongly implies that a minimum wage hike cannot DECREASE fast-food employment by all that much.) The Card and Krueger paper goes into quite a bit more detail, of course, including several other specifications of the same basic concept; reading it is a good tutorial on the method. ==Critics== Bertrand et al. in an article published at Quarterly Journal of Economics in February 2004 asked the question ''How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates?'' and apparently the answer is "not all that much." According to Bertrand et al. most papers that employ Difference-in-Differences estimation use many years of data and focus on [[Autocorrelation#Regression_analysis|serially correlated]] outcomes but ignore that the resulting [[Standard error (statistics)|standard errors]] are inconsistent, leading to serious over-estimation of t-statistics and [[Statistical significance|significance levels]].<ref>[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mullainathan/files/trustdifferences.pdf Bertrand, M.; Duflo, E.; Mullainathan, S. "How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates?" The Quarterly Journal of Economics, v. 119, n. 1, p. 249-275, February 2004.]</ref> ''These conventional DID standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an "effect" significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions.'' To alleviate this problem ''two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a "pre" and "post" period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.'' ==See also== * [[Treatment effect]] * [[Average treatment effect]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.nber.org/papers/w14237 How Does Charitable Giving Respond to Incentives and Income?

Differential inclusions arise in many situations including [[differential variational inequality|differential variational inequalities]], [[projected dynamical system]]s, dynamic [[Coulomb friction]] problems and [[fuzzy set]] arithmetic. For example, the basic rule for Coulomb friction is that the friction force has magnitude ''μN'' in the direction opposite to the direction of slip, where ''N'' is the normal force and ''μ'' is a constant (the friction coefficient). However, if the slip is zero, the friction force can be ''any'' force in the correct plane with magnitude smaller than or equal to ''μN'' Thus, writing the friction force as a function of position and velocity leads to a set-valued function. ==Theory== Existence theory usually assumes that ''F''(''t'', ''x'') is an [[hemicontinuous|upper semi-continuous]] function of ''x'', measurable in ''t'', and that ''F''(''t'', ''x'') is a closed, convex set for all ''t'' and ''x''. Existence of solutions for the initial value problem :<math>\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\in F(t,x(t)), \quad x(t_0)=x_0</math> for a sufficiently small time interval [''t''<sub>0</sub>, ''t''<sub>0</sub> + ''ε''), ''ε'' > 0 then follows. Global existence can be shown provided ''F'' does not allow "blow-up" (<math>\scriptstyle \Vert x(t)\Vert\,\to\,\infty</math> as <math>\scriptstyle t\,\to\, t^*</math> for a finite <math>\scriptstyle t^*</math>). Existence theory for differential inclusions with non-convex ''F''(''t'', ''x'') is an active area of research. Uniqueness of solutions usually requires other conditions. For example, suppose <math>F(t,x)</math> satisfies a [[Lipschitz_continuity#One-sided_Lipschitz|one-sided Lipschitz condition]]: :<math>(x_1-x_2)^T(F(t,x_1)-F(t,x_2))\leq C\Vert x_1-x_2\Vert^2</math> for some ''C'' for all ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub>. Then the initial value problem :<math>\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\in F(t,x(t)), \quad x(t_0)=x_0</math> has a unique solution. This is closely related to the theory of '''maximal monotone operators''', as developed by Minty and [[Haïm Brezis]]. ==Applications== Differential inclusions can be used to understand and suitably interpret discontinuous ordinary differential equations, such as arise for Coulomb friction in mechanical systems and ideal switches in power electronics. An important contribution has been made by Filippov, who studied regularizations of discontinuous equations. Further the technique of regularization was used by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] in the theory of [[differential game]]s. ==References== * Jean-Pierre Aubin, Arrigo Cellina ''Differential Inclusions, Set-Valued Maps And Viability Theory'', Grundl. der Math.
