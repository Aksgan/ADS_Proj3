Earning his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], he followed in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, double-majoring in [[computer science]]. After graduation, he moved to [[Stanford]] to acquire a Ph.D in computer science. There he met [[Larry Page]], whom he later became friends with. They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin’s [[data mining]] system to build a superior [[search engine]]. The program became popular at Stanford and they suspended their Ph.D studies to start up Google in a rented garage. ''The Economist'' magazine referred to Brin as an "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment Man]]", and someone who believes that "knowledge is always good, and certainly always better than ignorance", a philosophy that is summed up by Google’s motto of making all the world’s information "universally accessible and useful"<ref name=Economist/> and "[[Don't be evil]]". ==Early life and education== Sergey Brin was born in [[Moscow]], in the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Jew]]ish parents, the son of Michael Brin and Eugenia Brin, both graduates of [[Moscow State University]]. His father is a mathematics professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and his mother is a research scientist at [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].<ref>Smale, Will (April 30, 2004).

In an interview with [[Mark Malseed]], author of ''The Google Story'',<ref name=Vise>Vise, David, and Malseed, Mark. ''The Google Story'', Delta Publ. (2006)</ref> Sergey's father explains how he was "forced to abandon his dream of becoming an [[astronomy|astronomer]] even before he reached college". Although an official policy of [[anti-Semitism]] didn't exist in the Soviet Union, Brin claims [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] heads barred Jews from upper professional ranks by denying them entry to universities; "Jews were excluded from the [[physics]] departments, in particular..." Michael Brin therefore changed his major to [[mathematics]] where he received nearly straight A's. He said, "Nobody would even consider me for [[graduate school]] because I was Jewish."<ref name=Moment>Malseed, Mark (February 2007).

Retrieved 2010-01-07.</ref> The Brin family lived in a three-room, 30 square meter (350 square foot) apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother.<ref name=Moment/> Sergey told Malseed, "I've known for a long time that my father wasn't able to pursue the career he wanted", but Sergey only picked up the details years later after they had settled in America. He learned how, in 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], he announced that it was time for the family to emigrate. "We cannot stay here any more", he told his wife and mother. At the conference, he was able to "mingle freely with colleagues from the [[United States]], [[France]], [[England]] and [[Germany]], and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the West were 'not monsters.'" He added, "I was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave..."<ref name=Moment/> Sergey's mother was less willing to leave their home in Moscow, where they had spent their entire lives. Malseed writes, "For Genia, the decision ultimately came down to Sergey. While her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his son's, for her, 'it was 80/20' about Sergey." They formally applied for their [[exit visa]] in September 1978, and as a result his father "was promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother also had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many [[refuseniks]]. During this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself [[computer programming]]. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.<ref name=Moment/> At an interview in October, 2000, Brin said, "I know the hard times that my parents went through there, and am very thankful that I was brought to the States."<ref name=Scott>Scott, Virginia. ''Google: Corporations That Changed the World'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2008)</ref> A decade earlier, in the summer of 1990, a few weeks before his 17th birthday, his father led a group of gifted high school math students, including Sergey, on a two-week [[exchange program]] to the Soviet Union. "As Sergey recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority" and he remembers that his first "impulse on confronting Soviet [[oppression]] had been to throw pebbles at a police car." Malseed adds, "On the second day of the trip, while the group toured a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] in the countryside near Moscow, Sergey took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'"<ref name=Moment/> ===Education in America=== Brin attended [[grade school]] at Paint Branch [[Montessori School]] in [[Adelphi, Maryland]], but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], nurtured his interest in mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. In September 1990, after having attended [[Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Greenbelt, Maryland)|Eleanor Roosevelt High School]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, College Park to study [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Science]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in May 1993 with honors.<ref name=resume>{{cite web |url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~sergey/resume.html |title=Resume |accessdate=2008-03-09 |last=Brin |first=Sergey |date=January 7, 1997 |quote= }}</ref> Brin began his graduate study in [[Computer Science]] at [[Stanford University]] on a [[NSF-GRF|graduate fellowship]] from the [[National Science Foundation]].
