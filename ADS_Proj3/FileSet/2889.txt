A subset <math>A</math> of the metric space <math>M</math> is closed iff every sequence in <math>A</math> that converges to a limit in <math>M</math> has its limit in <math>A</math>. == Types of metric spaces == ===Complete spaces=== A metric space <math>M</math> is said to be ''[[Complete metric space|complete]]'' if every [[Cauchy sequence]] converges in <math>M</math>. That is to say: if <math>d(x_n, x_m) \to 0</math> as both <math>n</math> and <math>m</math> independently go to infinity, then there is some <math>y\in M</math> with <math>d(x_n, y) \to 0</math>. Every [[Euclidean space]] is complete, as is every closed subset of a complete space. The rational numbers, using the absolute value metric <math>d(x,y) = \vert x - y \vert</math>, are not complete. Every metric space has a unique (up to [[isometry]]) completion, which is a complete space that contains the given space as a [[dense set|dense]] subset. For example, the real numbers are the completion of the rationals. If <math>X</math> is a complete subset of the metric space <math>M</math>, then <math>X</math> is closed in <math>M</math>. Indeed, a space is complete [[iff]] it is closed in any containing metric space. Every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]]. ===Bounded and totally bounded spaces=== A metric space ''M'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists some number ''r'', such that ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M''. The smallest possible such ''r'' is called the [[diameter]] of ''M''. The space ''M'' is called '''precompact''' or '''[[totally bounded]]''' if for every ''r'' > 0 there exist finitely many open balls of radius ''r'' whose union covers ''M''. Since the set of the centres of these balls is finite, it has finite diameter, from which it follows (using the triangle inequality) that every totally bounded space is bounded. The converse does not hold, since any infinite set can be given the discrete metric (one of the examples above) under which it is bounded and yet not totally bounded. Note that in the context of [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s in the space of [[real number]]s and occasionally regions in a Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>n</sup> a bounded set is referred to as "a finite interval" or "finite region". However boundedness should not in general be confused with "finite", which refers to the number of elements, not to how far the set extends; finiteness implies boundedness, but not conversely. ===Compact spaces=== A metric space ''M'' is compact if every sequence in ''M'' has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in ''M''. This is known as [[sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and, in metric spaces (but not in general topological spaces), is equivalent to the topological notions of [[countably compact space|countable compactness]] and [[compact space|compactness]] defined via [[open cover]]s. Examples of compact metric spaces include the closed interval [0,1] with the absolute value metric, all metric spaces with finitely many points, and the [[Cantor set]]. Every closed subset of a compact space is itself compact. A metric space is compact [[iff]] it is complete and totally bounded. This is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Note that compactness depends only on the topology, while boundedness depends on the metric. [[Lebesgue's number lemma]] states that for every open cover of a compact metric space ''M'', there exists a "Lebesgue number" δ such that every subset of ''M'' of [[diameter]] < δ is contained in some member of the cover. Every compact metric space is [[second countable]],<ref>[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html PlanetMath: a compact metric space is second countable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is a continuous image of the [[Cantor set]]. (The latter result is due to [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn|Urysohn]].) ===Locally compact and proper spaces=== A metric space is said to be [[locally compact]] if every point has a compact neighborhood. Euclidean spaces are locally compact, but infinite-dimensional Banach spaces are not. A space is [[proper space|proper]] if every closed ball {''y'' : ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r''} is compact. Proper spaces are locally compact, but the converse is not true in general. ===Connectedness=== A metric space ''M'' is [[connected space|connected]] if the only subsets that are both open and closed are the empty set and ''M'' itself. A metric space ''M'' is [[connectedness|path connected]] if for any two points ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' there exists a continuous map ''f'':[0,1]→''M'' with ''f''(0)=''x'' and ''f''(1)=''y''. Every path connected space is connected, but the converse is not true in general. There are also local versions of these definitions: [[locally connected space]]s and [[connectedness|locally path connected spaces]]. [[Simply connected space]]s are those that, in a certain sense, do not have "holes". ===Separable spaces=== A metric space is [[separable space]] if it has a [[countable]] [[dense set|dense]] subset. Typical examples are the real numbers or any Euclidean space. For metric spaces (but not for general topological spaces) separability is equivalent to [[second countable space|second countability]] and also to the [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] property. ==Types of maps between metric spaces== Suppose (''M''<sub>1</sub>,''d''<sub>1</sub>) and (''M''<sub>2</sub>,''d''<sub>2</sub>) are two metric spaces. ===Continuous maps=== {{Main|Continuous function (topology)}} The map ''f'':''M''<sub>1</sub>→''M''<sub>2</sub> is [[continuous map|continuous]] if it has one (and therefore all) of the following equivalent properties: ;General topological continuity: for every open set ''U'' in ''M''<sub>2</sub>, the [[preimage]] ''f''<sup> -1</sup>(''U'') is open in ''M''<sub>1</sub> :This is the general definition of [[Continuity (topology)|continuity in topology]]. ;Sequential continuity: if (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a sequence in ''M''<sub>1</sub> that converges to ''x'' in ''M''<sub>1</sub>, then the sequence (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converges to ''f''(''x'') in ''M''<sub>2</sub>. :This is [[sequential continuity]], due to [[Eduard Heine]]. ;ε-δ definition: for every ''x'' in ''M''<sub>1</sub> and every ε>0 there exists δ>0 such that for all ''y'' in ''M''<sub>1</sub> we have ::<math>d_1(x,y)<\delta \implies d_2(f(x),f(y))< \epsilon.</math> :This uses the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]], and is due to [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]]. Moreover, ''f'' is continuous if and only if it is continuous on every compact subset of ''M''<sub>1</sub>. The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every compact set under a continuous function is compact, and the image of every connected set under a continuous function is connected. ===Uniformly continuous maps=== The map ''ƒ'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub> is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] if for every ''ε'' > 0 there exists ''δ'' >
