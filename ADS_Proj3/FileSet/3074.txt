This hotfix was released because users have reported disconnect or write error issues with Serial ATA disk drives on their nForce 680i motherboards. It is an update specifically for SATA Disk Drives and system instability. System instability is observed in the following ways (not a complete list): *Random application shutdown *Corrupted boot drive *BSOD (Blue screen of death) *Corrupt data To address them, BIOS updates were released for some NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI based motherboards that eliminate those symptoms. Affected motherboards include: *EVGA nForce 680i SLI *[http://www.bfgtech.com/680i_bios_update_page.htm BFG nForce 680i SLI] *Biostar TF680i SLI Deluxe *ECS PN2-SLI2+ This update is supposed to improve system stability and prevent future stability issues related to SATA disk drives on those systems requiring this hotfix. NVIDIA has strongly recommended that all customers upgrade their motherboards to the newest available BIOS revision that their nForce 680i-based motherboards could support, regardless of whether or not they have experienced the issues. Also, NVIDIA has stated that this upgrade will preserve the user's current computer settings. ==See also== * [[Comparison of Nvidia chipsets]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4637 DailyTech - More NVIDIA nForce 600 Series Details Revealed] {{NVIDIA}} [[Category:Motherboard]] [[Category:Nvidia]] [[de:Nvidia nForce 600]] [[zh:NForce 600]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25629</id> <title>NIST Special Publication 800-37</title> <text>NIST Special Publication 800-37, "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems" was developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Working Group. It aims to transform the traditional [[Certification and Accreditation]] (C&A) process into the six-step [[Risk management framework]] (RMF). The second step of the RMF is to select the appropriate subset of [[security controls]] from the control catalog in [[NIST Special Publication 800-53]]. ==External links== * [http://nistdocs.com NIST Special Publication 800-37 Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems] [[Category:Information assurance standards]] [[Category:Standards]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25630</id> <title>NIST Special Publication 800-53</title> <text>'''NIST Special Publication 800-53''', "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," catalogs security controls for U.S. federal [[information systems]]. It is published by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], which is a non-regulatory agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce]]. A key part of the [[Certification and Accreditation]] process for federal [[information system]]s is selecting and implementing a subset of the controls (safeguards) from the Security Control Catalog (NIST 800-53, Appendix F) . The security categorization of the information system (low, moderate or high) determines the baseline collection of controls that must be implemented and monitored. The first and second steps in the [[Risk management framework]], defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37, are to categorize the information system and then select the controls from the control catalog. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. == References == {{reflist}} *{{cite book |title=Information Assurance for the Enterprise |last=Schou |first=Corey |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw Hill Irwin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-07-225524-9 }} ==External links== * [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53-Rev3/sp800-53-rev3-final.pdf NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, Revision 3] * [http://nistdocs.com NIST Special Publication 800-37 Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems] {{DEFAULTSORT:Nist Special Publication 800-53}} [[Category:Information assurance standards]] [[Category:Standards]] [[Category:Article Feedback Pilot]] {{Library-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>25631</id> <title>NIST hash function competition</title> <text>{{Portal|Cryptography}} The '''NIST hash function competition''' is an open competition held by the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] for a new '''SHA-3''' function to replace the older [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-2]], which was formally announced in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' on November 2, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf|title=Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 212|date=Friday, November 2, 2007|accessdate=2008-11-06|work=Federal Register|publisher=Government Printing Office|format=PDF}} </ref> "NIST is initiating an effort to develop one or more additional hash algorithms through a public competition, similar to the [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|development process]] for the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/index.html|title=cryptographic hash project - Background Information|accessdate=2008-11-06 |work=Computer Security Resource Center|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=November 2, 2007}}</ref> Submissions were due October 31, 2008, with a list of candidates accepted for the first round published December 9, 2008.<ref name="Round1">{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/index.html|title=Round 1|date=2008-12-09|accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> NIST held a conference in late February 2009 where submitters gave presentations on their algorithms and NIST officials discussed criteria for narrowing down the field of candidates for Round 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/Round1/Feb2009/index.html|title=The First SHA-3 Candidate Conference|author=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=December 9, 2008|accessdate=23 December
