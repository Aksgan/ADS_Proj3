non-traditional objects, as well as to advance the state of the art in these areas. * user interfaces and visualization, intended to developing methodologies, techniques and tools to enable future digital libraries designers and developers to meet not only the technological, but also the user-oriented requirements in a balanced way. * knowledge extraction and semantic interoperability intended to explore the potential of new models, algorithms, methodologies and processes in a variety of technical applications, institutional frameworks and cross-sectoral environments, which will lead to the creation of guidelines and recommendations of best practice concerning knowledge extraction and [[semantic interoperability]]. * preservation: supposed to provide the methodological framework and theory for ensuring that digital libraries research addresses [[digital preservation|preservation]] issues and digital libraries incorporate preservation elements in their designs. * evaluation - to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for digital libraries [[evaluation]], by researching new methodologies and corresponding toolkits and test-beds in order to enable new evaluations and to ease the application of standard evaluation methods. Among its cross-cluster activities, DELOS attempted to develop a Digital Library Reference Model [http://www.delos.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=345] aiming at providing a conceptual framework for the new research field laying at the intersection of the many diverse disciplines involved in digital libraries ([[data management]], [[information retrieval]], [[document management system]], [[information systems]], the [[World Wide Web|web]], [[image processing]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[human-computer interaction]], mass-storage systems, etc.), and on a globally integrated prototype implementation of a digital library management system, DelosDLMS [http://www.delos.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=502], which would serve as a partial implementation of the reference model, encompassing several software components developed by the project partners. In addition to workshops dedicated to specific research topics, DELOS sponsored an annual conference known as the [[European Conference on Digital Libraries]], a major European event focusing on digital libraries and associated technical, practical and social issues. As for [[education]] and [[technology transfer]], DELOS organized summer schools on key aspects of digital library maintenance (e.g. preservation, access to multimedia objects, library studies). ==References== <references/> * [http://www.delos.info/files/pdf/workprogramme/ta_1_2_summary.pdf DELOS Work Programme Summary] (from the Technical Annex to the DELOS contract, which was approved by the [[European Commission]] in December 2003) * [http://www.delos.info/files/pdf/workprogramme/ta_6_jpa_outline.pdf Outline of DELOS Joint Program of Activities] (from the Technical Annex to the DELOS contract, which was approved by the [[European Commission]] in December 2003) ==External links== * [http://www.delos.info/ DELOS website] * [http://www.ecdlconference.eu/ ECDL Conference Series] [[Category:European research networks]] [[Category:Internet and the European Union]] [[Category:Digital library projects]] [[nl:DELOS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8993</id> <title>DHTMLEdit</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''DHTMLEdit''' is an [[ActiveX]] for Microsoft [[Internet Explorer]] 5 and later. It allows Web authors and application developers to add [[WYSIWYG]] [[DHTML]] editing capabilities to their Web sites and applications. The editing component uses Microsoft's [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology to provide access to editing services such as basic HTML formatting, tables, undo and redo, and absolute positioning. Because of several security issues with this ActiveX, Microsoft decided to discontinue shipping it with [[Windows Vista]]. Also Internet Explorer has continued to evolve, incorporating WYSIWYG editing features of its own in Internet Explorer 5.5 and Internet Explorer 6. The control was present in the Beta 1 version of Windows Vista, but is absent in subsequent Windows releases. However, because several programs and websites require this control to function correctly, it is still available as a separate download from Microsoft Download Center.

It has a syntax similar to [[FORTRAN]] and [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], along with [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] arithmetic. It shares the [[COBOL]] program structure of data and procedure divisions. ==History== DIBOL was originally marketed by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in 1970. The original version, DIBOL-8, was produced for [[PDP-8]], [[PDP-11]] and DIBOL-32 [[VAX/VMS]] systems, though it can also be run on other systems through [[emulator]]s. [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Standards were released in 1983, 1988 and 1992. The 1992 standard was revised in 2002. ==See also== * [[Timeline of programming languages]] ==External links== * [http://www.dibol.com Official DIBOL site] * [http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ANSI+INCITS+165%2D1992+%28R2002%29 ANSI INCITS 165-1992 (R2002)] Programming Language DIBOL (Downloadable [[PDF]] Standard for purchase from [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]) * [http://www.synergex.com/ Synergex] [http://www.synergex.com/solutions/synergy/ Synergy/DE] features the Synergy/DBL DIBOL compiler. ==Reading== * {{cite book |author=American National Standards Institute |authorlink=ANSI |coauthors=[[Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association]] ([[CBEMA]]) |title=American National Standard for Information Systems- Programming Language, DIBOL |year=1988 |month= |publisher=[[American National Standards Institute]] |location=New York, NY|oclc=23056850 }} * {{cite book |author=American National Standards Institute |authorlink=ANSI |coauthors=[[Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association]] ([[CBEMA]]) |title=American National Standard for Information Systems- Programming Language, DIBOL |year=1992 |month= |publisher=[[American National Standards Institute]] |location=New York, NY|oclc=27058852 }} [[Category:Procedural programming languages]] [[Category:OpenVMS software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8999</id> <title>DICING</title> <text>In [[cryptography]], '''DICING''' is a [[stream cipher|stream cypher]] [[algorithm]] developed by [[Li An-Ping]].
