impedances or to decouple parts of the circuits :Quite often LC-coupled and transformer-coupled amplifiers cannot be distinguished as a transformer is some kind of inductor. ;[[Direct coupled amplifier]], using no impedance and bias matching components :This class of amplifier was very uncommon in the vacuum tube days when the anode (output) voltage was at greater than several hundred volts and the grid (input) voltage at a few volts minus. So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC (e.g., in an oscilloscope). In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible. === Frequency range === Depending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles. *Frequency ranges down to DC are only used when this property is needed. DC amplification leads to specific complications that are avoided if possible; '''DC-blocking''' [[capacitor]]s are added to remove DC and sub-sonic frequencies from audio amplifiers. *Depending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. Up to the MHz range only "discrete" properties need be considered; e.g., a terminal has an input impedance. *As soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g., at 100 MHz the wavelength is 3 m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3 cm) design properties radically change. For example, a specified length and width of a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity. *Above a few 100 MHz, it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. In most cases PCB traces of very closely defined shapes are used instead. The frequency range handled by an amplifier might be specified in terms of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (normally implying a response that is 3 [[dB]] down when the frequency reaches the specified bandwidth), or by specifying a frequency response that is within a certain number of [[dB|deciBels]] between a lower and an upper frequency (e.g. "20 Hz to 20 kHz plus or minus 1 dB"). === Type of load === *Untuned **audio **video *Tuned (RF amps) - used for amplifying a single [[radio frequency]] or a [[Radio_spectrum#Bands|band]] of frequencies == Implementation == {{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}} Amplifiers are implemented using active elements of different kinds: *The first active elements were relays. They were for example used in transcontinental telegraph lines: a weak current was used to switch the voltage of a battery to the outgoing line. *For transmitting audio, [[Carbon_microphone#Carbon_microphones_used_as_amplifiers|carbon microphones were used]] as the active element. This was used to modulate a radio-frequency source in one of the first AM audio transmissions, by [[Reginald Fessenden]] on Dec. 24, 1906.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuits |last=Lee |first=Thomas |year=2004 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780521835398 |page=8}}</ref> *In the 1960s, the transistor started to take over. These days, discrete transistors are still used in high-power amplifiers and in specialist audio devices. *Up to the early 1970s, most amplifiers used [[vacuum tubes]] ("valves" in the UK). Today, tubes are used for specialist audio applications such as guitar amplifiers and audiophile amplifiers. Many broadcast transmitters still use vacuum tubes. *Beginning in the 1970s, more and more transistors were connected on a single chip therefore creating the [[integrated circuit]]. Nearly all amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits. For exotic purposes, other active elements have been used. For example, in the early days of the communication satellite [[parametric amplifier]]s were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacity was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions, this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station. The operating principle of a parametric amplifier is somewhat similar to the principle by which children keep their swings in motion: as long as the swing moves you only need to change a parameter of the swinging entity; e.g., you must move your center of gravity up and down. In our case, the capacity of the diode is changed periodically. == Power amplifier classes == ==== Angle of flow or conduction angle ==== Power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for [[analog circuit|analog]] designs, and class D and E for switching designs based upon the conduction angle or ''angle of flow'', Θ, of the input signal through the (or each) output amplifying device, that is, the portion of the input signal cycle during which the amplifying device conducts. The image of the conduction angle is derived from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. (If the device is always on, Θ = 360°.) The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier [[Electrical efficiency|power efficiency]]. The various classes are introduced below, followed by more detailed discussion under individual headings later on. ;Class A :100% of the input signal is used (conduction angle Θ = 360° or 2π); i.e., the active element remains conducting<ref>RCA Receiving Tube Manual, RC-14 (1940) p 12</ref> (works in its "linear" range) all of the time. Where efficiency is not a consideration, most small signal [[linear amplifier]]s are designed as [[Class A amplifier|class A]]. Class A amplifiers are typically more linear and less complex than other types, but are very inefficient. This type of amplifier is most commonly used in small-signal stages or for low-power applications (such as driving headphones). Subclass A2 is sometimes used to refer to [[vacuum tube]] class A stages where the grid is allowed to be driven slightly positive on signal peaks, resulting in slightly more power than normal class A (A1; where the grid is always negative<ref>ARRL Handbook, 1968; page 65</ref>), but incurring more distortion. ;Class B :<p>50% of the input signal is used (Θ = 180° or π; i.e., the active element works in its linear range half of the time and is more or less turned off for the other half). In most [[Class B amplifier|class B]], there are two output devices (or sets of output devices), each
