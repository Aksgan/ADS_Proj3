drives had very small buffers, and thus had to be reformatted to a different interleave (just like ST-506 disks) when used on slow computers, such as early [[Amiga#Peripherals|Commodore Amiga]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s and [[Apple Macintosh]]es. ATA disks have typically had no problems with interleave or data rate, due to their controller design, but many early models were incompatible with each other and couldn't run with two devices on the same physical cable in a master/slave setup. This was mostly remedied by the mid-1990s, when ATA's specification was standardized and the details began to be cleaned up, but still causes problems occasionally (especially with CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks, and when mixing [[Ultra DMA]] and non-UDMA devices). Serial ATA does away with master/slave setups entirely, placing each disk on its own channel (with its own set of I/O ports) instead. FireWire/IEEE 1394 and USB(1.0/2.0) HDDs are external units containing generally ATA or SCSI disks with ports on the back allowing very simple and effective expansion and mobility. Most FireWire/IEEE 1394 models are able to [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chain]] in order to continue adding peripherals without requiring additional ports on the computer itself. USB however, is a point to point network and doesn't allow for daisy-chaining. USB hubs are used to increase the number of available ports and are used for devices that don't require charging since the current supplied by hubs is typically lower than what's available from the built-in USB ports. ===Disk interface families used in personal computers=== Notable families of disk interfaces include: [[Image:Pata hdds.jpg|thumb|300px|Several Parallel ATA hard disk drives]] *Historical '''bit serial interfaces''' connect a hard disk drive (HDD) to a hard disk controller (HDC) with two cables, one for control and one for data. (Each drive also has an additional cable for power, usually connecting it directly to the power supply unit). The HDC provided significant functions such as serial/parallel conversion, data separation, and track formatting, and required matching to the drive (after formatting) in order to assure reliability. Each control cable could serve two or more drives, while a dedicated (and smaller) data cable served each drive. **ST506 used [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] (Modified Frequency Modulation) for the data encoding method. **ST412 was available in either MFM or [[Run Length Limited|RLL]] (Run Length Limited) encoding variants. **[[Enhanced Small Disk Interface]] (ESDI) was an industry standard interface similar to ST412 supporting higher data rates between the processor and the disk drive. *Modern '''bit serial interfaces''' connect a hard disk drive to a host bus interface adapter (today typically integrated into the "[[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]]") with one data/control cable. (As for historical ''bit serial interfaces'' above, each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit.) **[[Fibre Channel]] (FC), is a successor to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market. It is a serial protocol. In disk drives usually the [[Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop]] (FC-AL) connection topology is used. FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, and it is the cornerstone of [[storage area network]]s (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like [[iSCSI]] and [[ATA over Ethernet]] have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use ''copper'' twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics. The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices, such as servers or [[disk array controller]]s. **[[Serial ATA]] (SATA). The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like [[EIA-422]]. That requires that data be transmitted serially. Similar [[differential signaling]] system is used in [[RS485]], [[LocalTalk]], [[USB]], [[Firewire]], and differential [[SCSI]]. **[[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS). The SAS is a new generation serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA. SAS uses a mechanically identical data and power connector to standard 3.5-inch SATA1/SATA2 HDDs, and many server-oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA hard drives. SAS uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands. [[File:Seagate ST33232A hard disk inner view.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a 1998 [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] hard disk drive which used [[Parallel ATA]] interface]] *'''Word serial interfaces''' connect a hard disk drive to a host bus adapter (today typically integrated into the "[[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]]") with one cable for combined data/control. (As for all ''bit serial interfaces'' above, each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit.) The earliest versions of these interfaces typically had a 8 bit parallel data transfer to/from the drive, but 16-bit versions became much more common, and there are 32 bit versions. Modern variants have serial data transfer. The word nature of data transfer makes the design of a host bus adapter significantly simpler than that of the precursor HDD controller. **[[Integrated Drive Electronics]] (IDE), later renamed to ATA, with the alias P-ATA ("parallel ATA") retroactively added upon introduction of the new variant [[Serial ATA]]. The original name reflected the innovative integration of HDD controller with HDD itself, which was not found in earlier disks. Moving the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive helped to standardize interfaces, and to reduce the cost and complexity. The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16 bits of data at a time on the data cable. The data cable was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements for data transfer to and from the hard drive led to an "ultra DMA" mode, known as [[AT Attachment#Parallel ATA interface|UDMA]]. Progressively swifter versions of this standard ultimately added the requirement for a 80-conductor variant of the same cable, where half of the conductors provides [[ground (electricity)|grounding]] necessary for enhanced high-speed signal quality by reducing [[crosstalk (electronics)|cross talk]]. The interface for 80-conductor only has 39 pins, the missing pin acting as a key to prevent incorrect insertion of the connector to an incompatible socket, a common cause of disk and controller damage. **EIDE was an unofficial update (by Western Digital) to the original
