set of points of a topological space is equivalently characterized as the set of functions from 1 to ''X''. When using the functor &Omega; to pass from '''Top''' to '''Frm''', all set-theoretic elements of a space are lost, but - using a fundamental idea of category theory - one can as well work on the [[function space]]s. Indeed, any "point" ''p''<sub>''x''</sub>: 1 &rarr; ''X'' in '''Top''' is mapped to a morphism &Omega;(''p''<sub>''x''</sub>): &Omega;(''X'') &rarr; &Omega;(1). The open set lattice of the one-element topological space &Omega;(1) is just (isomorphic to) the two-element locale 2 = { 0, 1 } with 0 < 1. After these observations it appears reasonable to define the set of points of a locale ''L'' to be the set of frame morphisms from ''L'' to 2. Yet, there is no guarantee that every point of the locale &Omega;(''X'') is in one-to-one correspondence to a point of the topological space ''X'' (consider again the indiscrete topology, for which the open set lattice has only one "point"). Before defining the required topology on pt(''X''), it is worthwhile to clarify the concept of a point of a locale further. The perspective motivated above suggests to consider a point of a locale ''L'' as a frame morphism ''p'' from ''L'' to 2. But these morphisms are characterized equivalently by the inverse images of the two elements of 2. From the properties of frame morphisms, one can derive that ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) is a lower set (since ''p'' is [[monotone]]), which contains a greatest element ''a''<sub>''p''</sub> = V ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) (since ''p'' preserves arbitrary suprema). In addition, the [[ideal (order theory)|principal ideal]] ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) is a [[ideal (order theory)|prime ideal]] since ''p'' preserves finite infima and thus the principal ''a''<sub>''p''</sub> is a [[prime (order theroy)|meet-prime element]]. Now the set-inverse of ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) given by ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(1) is a [[filter (mathematics)|completely prime filter]] because ''p''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0) is a principal prime ideal. It turns out that all of these descriptions uniquely determine the initial frame morphism. We sum up: A point of a locale ''L'' is equivalently described as: * a frame morphism from ''L'' to 2 * a principal prime ideal of ''L'' * a meet-prime element of ''L'' * a completely prime filter of ''L''. All of these descriptions have their place within the theory and it is convenient to switch between them as needed. === The functor pt === Now that a set of points is available for any locale, it remains to equip this set with an appropriate topology in order to define the object part of the functor pt. This is done by defining the open sets of pt(''L'') as :&phi;(''a'') = { ''p'' in pt(''L'') | ''p''(''a'') = 1 }, for every element ''a'' of ''L''. Here we viewed the points of ''L'' as morphisms, but one can of course state a similar definition for all of the other equivalent characterizations. It can be shown that setting &Omega;(pt(''L'')) = {&phi;(''a'') | ''a'' in ''L''} does really yield a topological space (pt(''L''), &Omega;(pt(''L''))). It is common to abbreviate this space as pt(''L''). Finally pt can be defined on morphisms of '''Frm''' rather canonically by defining, for a frame morphism ''g'' from ''L'' to ''M'', pt(''g''): pt(''M'') &rarr; pt(''L'') as pt(''g'')(''p'') = ''p'' o ''g''. In words, we obtain a morphism from ''L'' to 2 (a point of ''L'') by applying the morphism ''g'' to get from ''L'' to ''M'' before applying the morphism ''p'' that maps from ''M'' to 2. Again, this can be formalized using the other descriptions of points of a locale as well - for example just calculate (''p'' o ''g'')<sup> &minus;1</sup>(0). === The adjunction of Top and Loc=== As noted several times before, pt and &Omega; usually are not inverses. In general neither is ''X'' [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to pt(&Omega;(''X'')) nor is ''L'' [[order isomorphism|order-isomorphic]] to &Omega;(pt(''L'')). However, when introducing the topology of pt(''L'') above, a mapping &phi; from ''L'' to &Omega;(pt(''L'')) was applied. This mapping is indeed a frame morphism. Conversely, we can define a continuous function &psi; from ''X'' to pt(&Omega;(''X'')) by setting &psi;(''x'') = &Omega;(''p''<sub>''x''</sub>), where ''p''<sub>''x''</sub> is just the characteristic function for the point ''x'' from 1 to ''X'' as described above. Another convenient description is given by viewing points of a locale as meet-prime elements. In this case we have &psi;(''x'') = ''X'' \ Cl{''x''}, where Cl{''x''} denotes the topological closure of the set {''x''} and \ is just set-difference. At this point we already have more than enough data to obtain the desired result: the functors &Omega; and pt define an adjunction between the categories '''Top''' and '''Loc''' = '''Frm'''<sup>op</sup>, where pt is right adjoint to &Omega; and the [[natural transformation]]s &psi; and &phi;<sup>op</sup> provide the required unit and counit, respectively. === The duality theorem === The above adjunction is not an equivalence of the categories '''Top''' and '''Loc''' (or, equivalently, a duality of '''Top''' and '''Frm'''). For this it is necessary that both &psi; and &phi; are isomorphisms in their respective categories. For a space ''X'', &psi;: ''X'' &rarr; pt(&Omega;(''X'')) is a homeomorphism [[if and only if]] it is [[bijective]]. Using the characterization via meet-prime elements of the open set lattice, one sees that this is the case if and only if every meet-prime open set is of the form ''X'' \ Cl{''x''} for a unique ''x''. Alternatively, every join-prime closed set is the closure of a unique point, where "join-prime" can be replaced by [[irreducible (order theory)|(join-) irreducible]] since we are in a distributive lattice. Spaces with this property are called '''sober'''. Conversely, for a locale ''L'', &phi;: ''L'' &rarr; &Omega;(pt(''L'')) is always surjective. It is additionally injective if and only if any two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''L'' for which ''a'' is not less-or-equal to ''b'' can be separated by points of the locale, formally: : if not ''a'' &le; ''b'', then there is a point ''p'' in pt(''L'') such that p(''a'') = 1 and p(''b'') = 0. If this condition is satisfied for all elements of the
