the portal. They then proceeded to fill the portal with offensive images. The damage has since been repaired and most of the users affected have been re-scouted. There were no news posts on the front page announcing the vandalism. == Collections == The admins of Newgrounds maintain a group of collections of submissions. General groups such as Games or Toons are subdivided into types or years. The collections help viewers of Newgrounds navigate the website easier and find what they are looking for. For example, the Lock Legion collection contains Flash videos pertaining to the Lock Legion, a specific group on Newgrounds. Series collections are also allotted to popular serial Flash, such as [[Eskimo Bob]], [[Retarded Animal Babies]], [[Neurotically Yours]], [[Salad Fingers]], [[Blockhead]], [[Madness Combat]], [[Jerry Jackson]] [[Looney Tunes]], [[Pac-Man]], [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], [[Mario]], [[The Simpsons]],and [[Pico (newgrounds.com)|Pico]]. The admins create the collections and decide which submissions go into the collection, but viewers can vote on which collections they think a given submission should be put into, which may influence this decision. Newgrounds has made recent moves to move to a user run Genre system for organizing flash, though this system is still in a data-collection phase.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}} == Newgrounds Forum (BBS) == The Newgrounds [[Internet forum|Forum]] has a community of roughly 7,000 unique postings a day. Its community discusses a topics in 14 forum categories ranging from site related [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] submissions to personal and off-topic discussion. The most popular section on the forum is "General" discussion which, as of August 5, 2010, houses more than 640,000 topics. The entire [[Bulletin Board System|BBS]] currently contains more than 992,038 topics.<ref name="BBS">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/|title=NG BBS|publisher=Newgrounds|accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref> In the Flash or Art forum there is a far more serious and moderated discussion as the staff strongly encourages a creative community. The most registered users to ever be on the BBS at the same time was 774 (July 17, 2007, at 5:23 PM).<ref name="BBS" /> Newgrounds also has a fluctuating number of [[Forum moderator|forum mods]]. The forums are often used to run competitions and community projects. Competitions are generally held for Art, Music, and Writing on monthly basis by an assortment of administrators, moderators, and regular users. Prizes are funded by Newgrounds and have generally been cash, store credit or hardware. In a more unofficial capacity, the NG News forums have been annually used to give away [[Wacom]] Tablets to artists who could not afford them otherwise, but have contributed promising art over the last year. These prizes have enabled or motivated many artists to contribute to the world of Flash movies, collaborate, and release hard editions of their product in online stores. == NG Store == Initially, Newgrounds sold stickers and other merchandise through a watered down version of today's store and [[cafepress]]. In 2007, Newgrounds started a basic store that was hosted completely on site, selling shirts and stickers of different Newgrounds series such as Pico and Tankmen. On August 19, 2008, Newgrounds launched its [http://www.newgrounds.com/store/ official store], selling more products than ever, including those made by other Newgrounds artists. Items for sale include: * Many T-shirts representing or displaying popular and successful artists or their work upon them. * Keychains, stickers, discs, toys, comics, posters, patches and DVDs depicting popular Flash series. The store currently only accepts credit cards. Store credit can also be earned from winning various contests. It has become more common in recent history for the community to collaborate and sell anthology style works in the store. Prime examples of this are the Newgrounds calendar and artist discs. == Charity == Since the Newgrounds API was released and users were allowed to split their earnings between authors, users have been donating a portion of their earnings to charities by creating and sharing accounts which resemble the names of the charities for donating. This began in 2009, when a user, ForNoReason, took it upon himself to organize flash artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1095038|title=Newgrounds Charity Project|publisher=Newgrounds|date=2009-08-17|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref> *The [[Yellow Ribbon Fund]] supports injured service men and their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yellowribbon.newgrounds.com/|title=Yellow Ribbon Fund|publisher=Newgrounds|date=2009-08-12|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref> *Breast Cancer Awareness supports awareness and research for the cure of breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breastcancer.newgrounds.com/| title=Breast Cancer Awareness|publisher=Newgrounds|date=2009-08-12|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref> *[[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] was introduced in the wake of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carecharity.newgrounds.com/|title=CareCharity|publisher=Newgrounds|date=2010-01-15|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref> == In the media == * '''Teletubbies:''' In 1998, Tom Fulp of Newgrounds created a spoof of ''[[Teletubbies]]'' called '''Teletubby Fun Land'''<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Fulp|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/tubby/|title=Teletubby Fun Land|publisher=Newgrounds|year=1998|accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref> which resulted in a law suit from the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Fulp|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/lit/bbc.html|title=First NG Battle - NG vs. BBC|date=1999-08-03|publisher=Newgrounds|accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref> This resulted in a boost of notoriety and media [[Publicity|exposure]], and the video was renamed '''Tele''bubby'' Fun Land'''. * '''Kaboom!:''' In mid-2002, Newgrounds received notoriety for hosting Kaboom!, a game in which the player controls an apparent Palestinian suicide bomber who kills men, women and children in Israel.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael Y.|last=Park|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,52268,00.html|title=Videogame Enrages Israeli Supporters|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=2002-05-08|accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref> Despite receiving criticism and calls for its removal from the internet by congresswoman Nita Lowey, the Jewish Anti-Defamation League, and other groups, Newgrounds continued to host the game. * '''Oklahoma City Escapades:''' Newgrounds received more negative attention in 2004 by refusing to remove [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/188661 Oklahoma City Escapades] from its site, which is a game that was developed by Joshua Bend, that spoofs the bombing of the Alfred P.
