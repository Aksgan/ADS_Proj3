y- coordinates are determined by the running totals of the values observed at two stations. If both stations are affected to the same extent by the same trends then a double mass curve should follow a straight line. A break in the slope of the curve would indicate that conditions have changed at one location but not at another. ==Notes== <references/> ==Further reading== * Dubreuil P. (1974).

One of the oldest and most popular{{Fact|date=March 2009}} examples of the [[MUD]] genre, it was developed from 1992-1995 and released in February 1996. It was originally intended for an online service planned by the [[Ziff-Davis]] company. When Ziff-Davis did not launch the service, ''DragonRealms'' was offered on [[GEnie]] and later [[AOL]], [[Compuserve]], and [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]]. When AOL and other services went to an hour rate instead of flat fees, ''DragonRealms'' was offered on the web on its own site<ref>[http://dragonrealms.play.net dragonrealms.play.net]</ref> and through the [[Microsoft Gaming Zone]]. ==Game== [[File:DragonRealms screenshot.PNG|right|thumb|A screenshot from ''DragonRealms'' showing examples of skills, communication, equipment and descriptions]] The design basis for the game was created by [[Simutronics]] founder [[David Whatley]], in response to a production request for a new game to open at the same time as the then-pending [[Ziff-Davis]] online service. While in development, the team called its as yet unnamed game many things, including "GemStone IV" and "Project Bob." When the Ziff-Davis contract was cancelled, the game was renamed as ''DragonRealms'', and opened on the GEnie service, where Simutronics already had other games including [[GemStone IV|GemStone III]] and Orb Wars. The game was implemented by a team of on-site employees and off-site contractors, led by Eric Slick, [[Elonka Dunin]], and John Donham, with assistance from Tina Hill, [[Stephanie Shaver]], David Dean, Nancy Gross, Jim Penrose, and Melissa (Callaway) Meyer, who later became producer of ''GemStone III''. In later years, ''GemStone III'' was extensively updated and took the more appropriate name for itself of ''GemStone IV'', though this was no relation to the earlier working title of the ''DragonRealms'' game. The two games, ''DragonRealms'' and ''GemStone'', are said to take place in the same game universe of Elanthia, but in different eras, though it has not always been clear which game world pre-dated the other. Both games are considered flagship products of Simutronics, and have been some of the longest-running and most popular online text games in existence.<ref name=97release>[http://www.play.net/corporate/release.asp?release=6]</ref> They were the top two products on GEnie, and in the mid-1990s were the top two games on [[America Online]], together bringing in over one million hours per month of usage.<ref name=97release /> During the first half of 2004, the staff of Simutronics and ''DragonRealms'' engaged in a major overhaul of the system to make it work with the newer game engine (IFE2). This project was dubbed "DR2" but, unlike ''GemStone IV'', the actual name of the game was not changed. ''DragonRealms 2'' removed some programming limitations which made it difficult to come up with some kinds of new content and new mechanics. However, ''DragonRealms 2'' did not in itself come with major new gameplay systems or content visible to the player; it was a behind the scenes transition enabling the [[Gamemaster]]s to create such systems in the future. ===Gameplay=== Character creation and gameplay in ''DragonRealms'' allows players to assume the role of a variety of races and professions and participate in combat, trading (in multiple currencies<ref>{{cite book | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]] | publisher = New Riders | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-1310-1816-7 | pages = 311 | quote = A virtual world can have multiple currencies, and exchange rates between them ... Simutronics' game DragonRealms successfully runs three "local" currencies. }}</ref>) and other activities in an array of different settings. Naval travel and combat, non-standard casting (magic) classes and a use-based training system and a comparatively active base of players distinguish ''DragonRealms'' from many other text games. Subscribers can choose to play on one of three different game servers, including the "Prime" server (intended for normal gameplay), the "Platinum" server (intended for mandatory roleplay acting) and "The Fallen" (intended for unrestricted player killing, idle time and use of scripted commands). Gameplay on ''DragonRealms'' also shares elements common to many [[role-playing game]]s, including the ability of players to increase character level (referred to as "circles" in ''DragonRealms'') through [[Experience point|experience]] gained in-game. Players train their characters' skills in specific categories in order to gain strength and abilities, and progress becomes more difficult as the character develops. ==References== {{Reflist}} * [[Amy Jo Kim]], ''Community Building on the Web'', 2000, Peachpit Press.
