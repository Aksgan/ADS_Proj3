can find distinct real numbers ''t'' and ''s'' such that ''z<sub>i</sub>'' + ''z<sub>j</sub>'' + ''tz<sub>i</sub>z<sub>j</sub>'' and ''z<sub>i</sub>'' + ''z<sub>j</sub>'' + ''sz<sub>i</sub>z<sub>j</sub>'' are complex (for the same ''i'' and ''j''). So, both ''z<sub>i</sub>'' + ''z<sub>j</sub>'' and ''z<sub>i</sub>z<sub>j</sub>'' are complex numbers. It is easy to check that every complex number has a complex square root, thus every complex polynomial of degree 2 has a complex root by the quadratic formula. It follows that ''z<sub>i</sub>'' and ''z<sub>j</sub>'' are complex numbers, since they are roots of the quadratic polynomial ''z''<sup>2</sup> − (''z<sub>i</sub>'' + ''z<sub>j</sub>'')''z'' + ''z<sub>i</sub>z<sub>j</sub>''. J. Shipman showed in 2007 that the assumption that odd degree polynomials have roots is stronger than necessary; any field in which polynomials of prime degree have roots is algebraically closed (so "odd" can be replaced by "odd prime" and furthermore this holds for fields of all characteristics). This is the best possible, as there are counterexamples if a single prime is excluded. Another algebraic proof of the fundamental theorem can be given using [[Galois theory]]. It suffices to show that '''C''' has no proper finite [[field extension]].<ref>A proof of the fact that this suffices can be seen [[Algebraically closed field#The field has no proper finite extension|here]].</ref> Let ''K''/'''C''' be a finite extension. Since the [[Normal extension#Normal closure|normal closure]] of ''K'' over '''R''' still has a finite degree over '''C''' (or '''R'''), we may assume [[without loss of generality]] that ''K'' is a [[normal extension]] of '''R''' (hence it is a [[Galois extension]], as every algebraic extension of a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 is [[separable extension|separable]]). Let ''G'' be the [[Galois group]] of this extension, and let ''H'' be a [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] 2-group of ''G'', so that the [[order (group theory)|order]] of ''H'' is a power of 2, and the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of ''H'' in ''G'' is odd. By the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], there exists a subextension ''L'' of ''K''/'''R''' such that Gal(''K''/''L'') = ''H''. As [''L'':'''R'''] = [''G'':''H''] is odd, and there are no nonlinear irreducible real polynomials of odd degree, we must have ''L'' = '''R''', thus [''K'':'''R'''] and [''K'':'''C'''] are powers of 2. Assuming for contradiction [''K'':'''C'''] > 1, the [[p-group|2-group]] Gal(''K''/'''C''') contains a subgroup of index 2, thus there exists a subextension ''M'' of '''C''' of degree 2. However, '''C''' has no extension of degree 2, because every quadratic complex polynomial has a complex root, as mentioned above. ==Corollaries== Since the fundamental theorem of algebra can be seen as the statement that the field of complex numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], it follows that any theorem concerning algebraically closed fields applies to the field of complex numbers. Here are a few more consequences of the theorem, which are either about the field of real numbers or about the relationship between the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers: * The field of complex numbers is the [[algebraic closure]] of the field of real numbers. * Every polynomial in one variable ''x'' with real coefficients is the product of a constant, polynomials of the form ''x'' + ''a'' with ''a'' real, and polynomials of the form ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'' with ''a'' and ''b'' real and ''a''<sup>2</sup> − 4''b'' < 0 (which is the same thing as saying that the polynomial ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'' has no real roots). * Every [[rational function]] in one variable ''x'', with real coefficients, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x'' − ''b'')<sup>''n''</sup> (where ''n'' is a natural number, and ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers), and rational functions of the form (''ax'' + ''b'')/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d'')<sup>''n''</sup> (where ''n'' is a natural number, and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are real numbers such that ''c''<sup>2</sup> − 4''d'' < 0). A [[corollary]] of this is that every rational function in one variable and real coefficients has an [[elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary]] [[Antiderivative|primitive]]. * Every [[algebraic extension]] of the real field is isomorphic either to the real field or to the complex field. ==Bounds on the zeroes of a polynomial== {{main|Properties of polynomial roots}} While the fundamental theorem of algebra states a general existence result, it is of some interest, both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view, to have information on the location of the zeroes of a given polynomial. The simpler result in this direction is a bound on the modulus: all zeroes <math>\zeta</math> of a monic polynomial <math>\scriptstyle z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1z +a_0</math> satisfy an inequality <math>\scriptstyle|\zeta|\leq R_{\infty},</math> where :<math>R_{\infty}:= 1+\max\{|a_0|,\cdots,|a_{n-1}|\}. </math> Notice that, as stated, this is not yet an existence result but rather an example of what is called an [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] bound: it says that ''if there are solutions'' then they lay inside the closed disk of center the origin and radius <math>\scriptstyle R_{\infty}</math>. However, once coupled with the fundamental theorem of algebra it says that the disk contains in fact at least one solution. More generally, a bound can be given directly in terms of any [[p-norm]] of the n-vector of coefficients <math>\scriptstyle a:=(\ a_0,\ a_1,...,\ a_{n-1})</math>, that is <math>\scriptstyle |\zeta|\leq R_p </math>, where <math>\scriptstyle R_p </math> is precisely the ''q''-norm of the 2-vector <math>\scriptstyle (1, \|a\|_p)</math>, ''q'' being the conjugate exponent of ''p'', 1/''p'' + 1/''q'' = 1, for any <math>\scriptstyle 1\leq p\leq\infty </math>. Thus, the modulus of any solution is also bounded by :<math> R_1:= \max\Bigl\{ 1 , \sum_{0\leq k<n} |a_k|\Bigr\},</math> :<math> R_p:= \biggl[ 1 + \Bigl(\sum_{0\leq k<n}|a_k|^p\Bigr)^{q/p}\biggr]^{1/q},</math> for <math>\scriptstyle 1<p<\infty </math> , and in particular :<math> R_2:= \sqrt{\sum_{0\leq k\leq n} |a_k|^2 }.</math> The case of a generic polynomial of degree n, <math>\scriptstyle P(z):= a_n z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1z +a_0</math>, is of course reduced to the case of a monic, dividing all coefficients by <math>\scriptstyle a_n\neq 0</math>. Also, in case that 0 is not a root, i.e. <math>\scriptstyle a_0 \neq 0</math>, bounds from below on the roots <math>\zeta</math> follow immediately as bounds from above on <math>\scriptstyle\frac{1}{\zeta}</math>, that is, the roots of <math>\scriptstyle a_0 z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}z +a_n</math>. Finally, the distance
