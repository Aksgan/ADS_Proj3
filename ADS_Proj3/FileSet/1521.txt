= R y</math>. Since <math>Q(t)</math> is continuous and periodic it must be bounded. Thus the stability of the zero solution for <math>y(t)</math> and <math>x(t)</math> is determined by the eigenvalues of <math>R</math>. The representation <math>\phi (t) = P(t)e^{tB}</math> is called a ''Floquet normal form'' for the fundamental matrix <math>\phi (t)</math>. The [[eigenvalue]]s of <math>e^{TB}</math> are called the [[characteristic multiplier]]s of the system. They are also the eigenvalues of the (linear) Poincaré maps <math>x(t) \to x(t+T)</math>. A '''Floquet exponent''' (sometimes called a characteristic exponent), is a complex <math>\mu</math> such that <math>e^{\mu T}</math> is a characteristic multiplier of the system. Notice that Floquet exponents are not unique, since <math>e^{(\mu + \frac{2 \pi i k}{T})T}=e^{\mu T}</math>, where <math>k</math> is an integer. The real parts of the Floquet exponents are called Lyapunov exponents. The zero solution is asymptotically stable if all Lyapunov exponents are negative, [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov stable]] if the Lyapunov exponents are nonpositive and unstable otherwise. * Floquet theory is very important for the study of [[dynamical systems]]. * Floquet theory shows stability in [[Hill's equation]] (introduced by [[George William Hill]]) approximating the motion of the [[moon]] as a [[harmonic oscillator]] in a periodic [[gravitational field]]. == Floquet's theorem applied to Mathieu equation== Mathieu's equation is related to the wave equation for the elliptic cylinder. Given <math>a \in \mathbb{R}, q \in \mathbb{C}</math>, the [[Mathieu equation]] is given by : <math>\frac {d^2 y} {dw^2} +(a-2q \cos 2w )y=0.</math> The Mathieu equation is a linear second-order differential equation with periodic coefficients. One of the most powerful results of Mathieu's functions is the Floquet's Theorem [1, 2]. It states that periodic solutions of Mathieu equation for any pair (''a'', ''q'') can be expressed in the form : <math>y(w)=F_{\nu}(w)=e^{iw \nu} P(w) \,</math> or : <math>y(w)=F_{\nu}(-w)=e^{-iw \nu} P(-w) \,</math> where <math> \nu</math> is a constant depending on ''a'' and ''q'' and ''P''(.) is <math> \pi </math>-periodic in ''w''. The constant <math> \nu</math> is called the ''characteristic exponent''. If <math> \nu</math> is an integer, then <math>F_{\nu}(w)</math> and <math>F_{\nu}(-w)</math> are linear dependent solutions. Furthermore, : <math>y(w+k \pi) =e^{i \nu k \pi}y(w)\text{ or }y(w+k \pi) =e^{-i \nu k \pi}y(w), \,</math> for the solution <math>F_{\nu}(w)</math> or <math>F_{\nu}(-w)</math>, respectively. We assume that the pair (''a'', ''q'') is such that <math>| \cosh (i \nu \pi) | <1</math> so that the solution <math> y(w)</math> is bounded on the real axis. General solution of Mathieu's equation (<math>q \in \mathbb{R}</math>, <math> \nu</math> non-integer) is the form : <math>y(w) =c_1 e^{i w \nu}P(w)+ c_2e^{-i w \nu}P(-w), \,</math> where <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math> are arbitrary constants. All bounded solutions --those of fractional as well as integral order-- are described by an infinite series of [[harmonic oscillation]]s whose amplitudes decrease with increasing frequency. Another very important property of Mathieu's functions is the orthogonality [3]: If <math>a( \nu +2p,q)</math> and <math>a( \nu +2s,q)</math> are simple roots of : <math> \cos(\pi\nu) - y(\pi = 0) = 0, \, </math> then: : <math>\int_0^\pi F_{\nu+2p} (w) F_{\nu+2s}(-w) \, dw = 0,\qquad p \ne s,</math> i.e., : <math>\langle F_{\nu +2p} (w),F_{\nu +2s} (w)\rangle = 0, \qquad p \ne s,</math> where <.,.> denotes an [[inner product]] defined from 0 to ''&pi;''. == References == *C.
