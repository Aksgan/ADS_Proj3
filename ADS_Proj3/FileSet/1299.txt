Each student writes on the topic of how they have prepared themselves for adulthood and entering the community at large. This thesis is submitted to the Assembly, who reviews it. The final stage of the thesis process is an oral defense given by the student in which they open the floor for questions, challenges and comments from all Assembly members. At the end, the Assembly votes by secret ballot on whether or not to award a diploma.<ref>[http://mountainlaurelsudbury.org/thesis-procedure.asp ''Graduation Thesis Procedure''], Mountain Laurel Sudbury School.</ref> ==See also== * [[Computer aided assessment]] * [[Confidence-Based Learning]] accurately measures a learner's knowledge quality by measuring both the correctness of his or her knowledge and the person's confidence in that knowledge. * [[E-scape]], a technology and approach that looks specifically at the assessment of creativity and collaboration. * [[Educational evaluation]] deals specifically with evaluation as it applies to an educational setting.

Dr. Shortliffe is a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in medicine. He was the principal developer of the clinical expert system [[MYCIN]], one of the first rule-based [[artificial intelligence]] expert systems, which obtained clinical data interactively from a physician user and was used to diagnose and recommend treatment for severe infections. While never used in practice (because it preceded the era of local-area networking and could not be integrated with patient records and physician workflow), its performance was shown to be comparable to and sometimes more accurate than that of Stanford infectious disease faculty.<ref>1. Rule-Based Expert Systems: The MYCIN Experiments of the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project -(edited by Bruce G. Buchanan and Edward H. Shortliffe; ebook version http://www.aaaipress.org/Classic/Buchanan/buchanan.html )</ref> This spurred the development of a wide range of activity in the development of rule-based expert systems, knowledge representation, belief nets and other areas, and its design greatly influenced the subsequent development of computing in medicine. He is also regarded as a founder of the field of [[biomedical informatics]], and in 2006 received one of its highest honors, the [[Morris Collen Award]] given by the [[American College of Medical Informatics]] (ACMI). He has held administrative positions in academic medicine, research and national bodies including the Institute of Medicine, American College of Physicians (ACP), the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Library of Medicine (NLM), and been influential in the development of medicine, computing and biomedical informatics nationally and internationally. His interests include the broad range of issues related to integrated medical decision-support systems and their implementation, biomedical informatics and medical education and training, and the Internet in medicine. In March 2007, he became founding Dean of the University of Arizona's new College of Medicine campus in Phoenix. He stepped down from this position in May 2008 and in January 2009 transferred his primary academic appointment to Arizona State University where he became Professor of Biomedical Informatics. He maintained a secondary appointment as Professor of Basic Medical Sciences and of Medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine (Phoenix Campus). Since November 2009 he has transferred his academic home to a part-time appointment as Professor, Biomedical Informatics, School of Health Information Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he now lives. In July 2009 Dr. Shortliffe assumed a position as President and Chief Executive Officer of
