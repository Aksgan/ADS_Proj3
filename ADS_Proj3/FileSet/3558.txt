occur in a wide range of grammatical constructions and is probably the most versatile kind of predicate. ====Individual-level predicates==== An '''individual-level predicate''' ("i-l predicate") is true throughout the existence of an individual. For example, if John is "smart", this is a property of him, regardless which particular point in time we consider. I-l predicates are more restricted than s-l ones. I-l predicates can't occur in ''presentational'' "there" sentences (a star in front of a sentence indicates that it is odd or ill-formed): : There are police available. ("available" is s-l) : *There are firemen altruistic. ("altruistic" is i-l) S-l predicates allow modification by manner adverbs and other adverbial modifiers. I-l ones do not. : John spoke French loudly in the corridor. ("speak French" can be interpreted as s-l) : *John knew French loudly in the corridor. ("know French" can't be interpreted as s-l) When an i-l predicate occurs in [[past tense]], it gives rise to what is called a "lifetime effect": The subject must be assumed to be dead or otherwise gone out of existence. : John was available. (s-l <math>\rightarrow</math> no lifetime effect) : John was altruistic. (i-l<math>\rightarrow</math> lifetime effect.) ====Kind-level predicates==== A '''kind-level predicate''' ("k-l predicate") is true of a kind of thing, but cannot be applied to individual members of the kind. An example of this is the predicate "are widespread." One can't meaningfully say of a particular individual John that he is widespread. One may only say this of kinds, as in : Humans are widespread. Certain types of [[noun phrase]] can't be the subject of a k-l predicate. We have just seen that a [[proper name]] can't be. [[Grammatical number|Singular]] [[article (grammar)|indefinite]] noun phrases are also banned from this environment: : *A cat is widespread. (compare: Nightmares are widespread.) ===Collective vs. distributive predicates=== Predicates may also be collective or distributive. Collective predicates require their subjects to be somehow plural, while distributive ones don't. An example of a collective predicate is "formed a line". This predicate can only stand in a nexus with a plural subject: : The students formed a line. : *The student formed a line. Other examples of collective predicates include "meet in the woods", "surround the house", "gather in the hallway" and "carry the piano together". Note that the last one ("carry the piano together") can be made non-collective by removing the word "together". [[Quantifiers]] differ with respect to whether or not they can be the subject of a collective predicate. For example, quantifiers formed with "all the" can, while ones formed with "every" or "each" cannot. : All the students formed a line. : All the students gathered in the hallway. : All the students carried a piano together. : *Each student gathered in the hallway. : *Every student formed a line. ==Other languages== ===Japanese=== The [[topic-comment]] structure of [[Japanese grammar]] yields very distinct predicates (as the comment). Indeed, [[Japanese adjectives]] and [[Japanese verbs]] behave rather similarly (for example, the negative form of a verb is an adjective), and can be understood as being two forms of predicates; predicate form is referred to as 終止形 (''shūshikei,'' terminal form). Further, unlike in English, Japanese adjectives do not exist independently of predication, and the [[dictionary form]] is the predicate form – for example, 小さい (''chiisai'') is the predicate form of "small", and means "is small", not simply "small". Accordingly, while some textbooks translate Japanese adjectives as English adjectives (translating 小さい as "small"), other textbooks, such as ''[[Japanese: The Spoken Language]],'' translate Japanese adjectives as English ''predicates'' (translating 小さい as "is small"). ===Korean=== {{Expand section|date=November 2010}} Similar considerations apply as in Japanese. ==See also== * [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)]] * [[Verb]] * [[Subject complement]] * [[Sentence (linguistics)]] * [[Clause]] * [[Inflectional phrase]] * [[Phrase]] * [[Topic-comment]] * [[Secondary predicate]] ==References== <References/> ==Bibliography== *{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Greg N.|year=1977|title=A unified analysis of the English bare plural|journal=Linguistics and Philosophy|volume=1|issue=3|pages=413–58}} *{{Cite book|last=Carlson|first=Gregory Norman|date=January 1, 1977|title=Reference to Kinds in English|publisher=Garland|location=New York}} (Also distributed by Indiana University Linguistics Club and GLSA UMass/Amherst.) *{{Cite journal|last=Jaeger|first=Gerhard|year=2001|title=Topic-comment structure and the contrast between stage level and individual level predicates|journal=Journal of Semantics|volume=18|issue=2|pages=83–126}} *Kratzer, Angelika (1995).

This formal system is distinguished from other systems in that its [[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] contain [[variable (math)|variable]]s which can be [[Quantification|quantified]]. Two common quantifiers are the [[existential quantification|existential]] ∃ ("there exists") and [[universal quantification|universal]] ∀ ("for all") quantifiers. The variables could be elements in the [[domain of discourse|universe under discussion]], or perhaps relations or functions over that universe. For instance, an existential quantifier over a function symbol would be interpreted as modifier "there is a function". In informal usage, the term "predicate logic" occasionally refers to [[first-order logic]]. <!-- that is why I wanted to make this separate stub.
