In 1995, researchers at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], at the instigation of Detective Art Bohanan of the Knoxville Police Department, discovered that children's fingerprints are considerably more short-lived than adult fingerprints.<ref name=ashbaugh1>[http://www.ornl.gov/info/press_releases/get_press_release.cfm?ReleaseNumber=mr19950327-00 Oak Ridge National Laboratory: The Case of the Vanishing Fingerprint]</ref> The rapid disappearance of children's fingerprints was attributed to a lack of the more waxy oils that become present at the onset of puberty. The lighter fatty acids of children's fingerprints evaporate within a few hours. As of 2010, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are investigating techniques to capture these lost fingerprints. ===Fingerprints reveal drug use=== The secretions, skin oils and dead cells in a human fingerprint contain residues of various chemicals and their [[metabolite]]s present in the body. These can be detected and used for forensic purposes. For example, the fingerprints of [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smokers]] contain traces of [[cotinine]], a [[nicotine]] metabolite; they also contain traces of nicotine itself. Caution should be used, however, as its presence may be caused by mere contact of the finger with a tobacco product. By treating the fingerprint with gold [[nanoparticle]]s with attached cotinine [[antibody|antibodies]], and then subsequently with a fluorescent agent attached to cotinine antibodies, the fingerprint of a smoker becomes fluorescent; non-smokers' fingerprints stay dark. The same approach, as of 2010, is being tested for use in identifying heavy [[coffee]] drinkers, [[cannabis smoking|cannabis smokers]], and users of various other drugs.<ref>Paul Marks (18 May 2007) [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11887-new-fingerprint-analysis-identifies-smokers.html "New fingerprint analysis identifies smokers,"] ''New Scientist'' (on-line version).</ref><ref>Tom Simonite (3 April 2006) [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8938-fingerprints-reveal-clues-to-suspects-habits.html "Fingerprints reveal clues to suspects' habits,"] ''New Scientist'' (on-line version).</ref> In 2008, British researchers developed methods of identifying users of marijuana, cocaine and methadone from their fingerprint residues.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Fingerprints Reveal Drug Use | first = Sarah | last = Everts | journal = [[Chemical & Engineering News]] | volume = 86 | issue = 51 |date = December 2008| page = 34 }}</ref> ===United States databases and compression=== In the United States, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] manages a fingerprint identification system and database called the [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]], or IAFIS, which currently holds the fingerprints and criminal records of over 51 million criminal record subjects and over 1.5 million civil (non-criminal) fingerprint records. [[U.S. Visit|US Visit]] currently holds a repository of the fingerprints of over 50 million people, primarily in the form of two-finger records. In 2008, US Visit hoped to have changed over to a system recording FBI-standard ten-print records. Most American law enforcement agencies use [[Wavelet Scalar Quantization]] (WSQ), a [[wavelet transform|wavelet]]-based system for efficient storage of compressed fingerprint images at 500 [[pixels per inch]] (ppi). WSQ was developed by the FBI, the Los Alamos National Lab, and the [[National Institute for Standards and Technology]] (NIST). For fingerprints recorded at 1000 ppi [[spatial resolution]], law enforcement (including the FBI) uses [[JPEG 2000]] instead of WSQ. ==History== [[File:Fingerprinting 1928.jpg|thumb|Fingerprinting clerks, [[Los Angeles Police Department]], 1928]] ===Antiquity and the medieval period=== Fingerprints have been found on ancient Babylonian clay tablets, seals, and pottery.<ref>{{Cite web | first = Berthold | last = Laufer | year = 1912 | title = History of the finger-print system | publisher = Smithsonian Institution Annual Report | url = http://www.scafo.org/library/160201.html }} Reprinted in {{Cite web | title = The Print [newsletter of South California Association of Fingerprint Officers] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–13 | date = March/April 2000 | url = http://www.scafo.org/The_Print/THE_PRINT_VOL_16_ISSUE_02.PDF }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | first = David | last = Ashbaugh | title = Quantitative-Qualitative Friction Ridge Analysis: An Introduction to Basic and Advanced Ridgeology | location = Boca Raton, Florida | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1999 | pages = 11–19 | isbn = 0849370078 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | first = Paul | last = Åström | authorlink = Paul Åström | year = 2007 | title = The study of ancient fingerprints | pages = 2–3 | journal = Journal of Ancient Fingerprints | issue = 1 | url = http://www.ancientfingerprints.org/nr1_lo.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | first1 = Paul | last1 = Åström | first2 = Sven A. | last2 = Eriksson | title = Fingerprints and Archaeology | volume = 28 | journal = Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology series | location = Göteborg, Sweden | publisher = Paul Åströms Förlag | year = 1980 }}</ref> They have also been found on the walls of Egyptian tombs and on Minoan, Greek, and Chinese<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/health/2010-02/09/content_12956719.htm | title = Finger prints found on pottery }}</ref> pottery, as well as on bricks and tiles from ancient Babylon and Rome. Some of these fingerprints were deposited unintentionally by the potters and masons as a natural consequence of their work, and others were made in the process of adding decoration. However, on some pottery, fingerprints have been impressed so deeply into the clay that they were possibly intended to serve as an identifying mark by the maker. Fingerprints were used as signatures in ancient Babylon in the second millennium BCE. In order to protect against forgery, parties to a legal contract would impress their fingerprints into a clay tablet on which the contract had been written. By 246 BCE, Chinese officials were impressing their fingerprints into the clay seals used to seal documents. With the advent of silk and paper in China, parties to a legal contract impressed their handprints on the document. Sometime before 851 CE, an Arab merchant in China, Abu Zayd Hasan, witnessed Chinese merchants using fingerprints to authenticate loans.<ref>{{Cite journal | first = Joseph Toussaint | last = Reinaud | title = Relation des voyages faits par les Arabes et les Persans dans l'Inde et a la Chine dans le IX Siecle... | location = Paris | publisher = Imprimerie royale | year = 1845 | volume = I | page = 42 }} quoted in: Laufer (1912)</ref> By 702, Japan had adopted the Chinese practice of sealing contracts with fingerprints.
