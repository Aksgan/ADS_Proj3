They focus on improving a student’s ability to write at the university level. These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". First Year Composition is a discipline of [[Composition studies|Composition Studies]]. ==Structure of Modern First Year Composition== First Year Composition is designed so that it meets the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://www.wpacouncil.org/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students learn specific material in both semesters of First Year Composition. ===First Semester Composition=== First Year Composition (FYC)courses are structured in a variety of ways. Some institutions of higher education require only one semester of FYC, while others requires two or three courses. Some courses continue to help students learn to write in modes, which are types of essays that are often named for their organizational pattern or apparent purpose, such as: *Evaluation *Classification *Contrast *Comparison *Cause and Effect *[[Definition]] *Process *[[Narrative]] *Description However, composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and Rhetoric and Composition, will focus on a much more rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of audience, purpose, context, invention, and style to their writing processes. ===Basic Writing=== [[Basic writing|Basic Writing]] is a division of Composition Studies that strives to bring students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process. == First Year Composition and Rhetoric == With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.<ref>Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.</ref> In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching audience awareness, Aristotle's three appeals (''ethos'', ''pathos'', and ''logos'') and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse. == References == <references /> ==External links== * [http://www.digitalparlor.org/icap/ Purdue University First Year Composition] * [http://web.utk.edu/~english/academics/freshman.shtml University of Tennessee Knoxville FYC ] [[Category:Rhetoric]] [[Category:Writing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13670</id> <title>First pass yield</title> <text>{{Context|date=August 2010}} '''First pass yield''' '''(FPY)''', also known as '''throughput yield''' '''(TPY)''', is defined as the number of units coming out of a process divided by the number of units going into that process over a specified period of time.<ref>http://www.six-sigma-material.com/Throughput-Yield.html</ref> Also related, "first time yield" (FTY) is simply the number of good units produced divided by the number of total units going into the process. First time yield considers only what went into a process step and what went out, while FPY adds the consideration of rework. Consider the following: You have a process that is divided into four sub-processes: A, B, C and D. Assume that you have 100 units entering process A. To calculate FTY you would: #Calculate the yield (number out of step/number into step) of each step. #Multiply these together. For Example: *100 units enter A and 90 leave. The FTY for process A is 90/100 = .9 *90 units go into B and 80 leave. The FTY for process B is 80/90 = .89 *80 units go into C and 75 leave. The FTY for C is 75/80 = .94 *75 units got into D and 70 leave. The FTY for D is 70/75 = .93 The total process yield is equal to FTYofA * FTYofB * FTYofC * FTYofD or .9*.89*.94*.93 = .70. You can also get the total process yield for the entire process by simply dividing the number of good units produced by the number going in to the start of the process. In this case, 70/100 = .70 or 70% yield. ==References== <references/> ==See also== * [[Business process]] * [[Design for Six Sigma]] * [[Total quality management]] * [[Total productive maintenance]] {{DEFAULTSORT:First Pass Yield}} [[Category:Business terms]] [[Category:Evaluation methods]] [[Category:Process management]] [[Category:Production and manufacturing]] {{business-stub}} [[de:First pass yield]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13681</id> <title>Fit/Gap Analysis</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=September 2008}} ''' Fit/Gap Analysis''' is an important component in the [[Project life cycle]].

Optimal chromosomes, or at least chromosomes which are ''more'' optimal, are allowed to [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|breed]] and mix their datasets by any of several techniques, producing a new generation that will (hopefully) be even better. An ideal fitness function correlates closely with the algorithm's goal, and yet may be computed quickly. Speed of execution is very important, as a typical genetic algorithm must be iterated many, many times in order to produce a usable result for a non-trivial problem. This is one of the main drawbacks of [[genetic algorithm|GAs]] in real world applications and limits their applicability in some industries. It is apparent that amalgamation
