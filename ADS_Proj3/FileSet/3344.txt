by an [[IBM]] employee and initially joined by other IBMers which quickly spread outside IBM. Whether IBM employees or not, Team OS/2 members initially volunteered their time and passion without official sanction from or connection to IBM. Members would promote OS/2 at trade shows, conferences, fairs, and in stores, participate in operating system discussions on [[CompuServe]], [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[Fidonet]] and Usenet, throw parties, help users install OS/2, contact media figures to explain OS/2 and generate interest, and in general exercise creativity and initiative in helping popularize OS/2.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.faqs.org/faqs/Team-OS2-FAQ/ | title= Team OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions | author= Christian Alice Scarborough | work= | accessdate = 2005-09-20}}</ref> The industry dynamics that gave rise to such passionate advocacy were multi-faceted. Perhaps the leading cause was antipathy for the idea that Microsoft could and would establish a monopoly for Windows and DOS, widely deemed as far inferior to OS/2. Additionally, many users feared that IBM, who had proven eminently capable of developing a superior PC operating system, knew very little about consumer marketing in the high-tech marketplace or establishing even a superior product as a standard in the cut-throat, get-there-first-at-any-cost arena dominated by Microsoft. Finally, the mere fact that so many copies of Windows were shipping to users (whom OS/2 advocates viewed as uncritical and uninformed), coupled with the fact that so many in the industry had so much riding on the success of OS/2, created conditions ripe for so many trying to take matters into their own hands. The only spark that was needed for this combustible situation to ignite was an example of evangelism provided by the "new IBM" - a few employees who took "empowerment" seriously, able to coordinate their efforts through participation in TEAMOS2 FORUM, an [[IBM VNET|internal IBM discussion group]]) - and passionate supporters outside IBM who adopted the ideas and modeled the behaviors of those who were early activists within IBM.. ==See also== *[[Apple evangelist]] *[[Comparison of Linux distributions]] *[[Comparison of operating systems]] *[[Computer zealotry]] *[[OS-tan]] *[[Security-evaluated operating system]]s *[[Security focused operating system]]s *[[Software wars]] *[[Technical evangelist]] *[[XvsXP]] *[[Linux adoption]] *[[After the Software Wars]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== * {{cite journal|date=April 1998|author=David Wagle|volume=27|journal=Linux Gazette|url=http://linuxgazette.net./issue27/wagle.html|title=Evangelism: A Unix Bigot and Linux Advocate's Spewings}} * [http://www.puppylinuxfaq.org/content/8/39/en/what-makes-puppy-linux-different.html What Makes Puppy Linux Different] * {{cite journal|version=0.81|url=http://www.softpanorama.org/OSS/bad_linux_advocacy_faq.shtml|title=Bad Linux Advocacy FAQ|date=1998-06-01|author=Nikolai Bezroukov}} *[http://www.writingonyourpalm.net/column040315.htm Writing On Your Palm: Ford vs Chevy] *[http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,57280,00.html Mac, Windows War Ends in Truce] *[http://www.macvswindows.com/ Mac vs. Windows] (Dead link) *[http://www.mindspring.com/~mcameron/carylu.html Computing's Holy War] *[http://www.mindspring.com/~mcameron/simple_argument.html A simple argument for the Mac] *[http://www.rodsbooks.com/buy-os2/ "Should I Buy OS/2 Warp?"] *[http://www.seul.org/docs/whylinux.html "Why Linux?"] *[http://archives.seul.org/seul/pub/Dec-1998/msg00052.html Linux advocacy documents team?] *[http://www.lowendmac.com/macinschool/promac.shtml MacInSchool's list of Mac advocacy articles] *[http://osadvocacy.frih.net/ A site dedicated to showing why people use certain OSes] {{DEFAULTSORT:Operating System Advocacy}} [[Category:Operating system advocacy|*]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27611</id> <title>Operation CHAOS</title> <text>{{ dablink|For the science fiction novel, see [[Operation Chaos (novel)]].

A department within the CIA was established in 1967 on orders from [[President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and later expanded under President [[Richard Nixon]]. The operation was launched under [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) [[Richard Helms]], by chief of [[counter-intelligence]], [[James Jesus Angleton]], and headed by Richard Ober. The program's goal was to unmask possible foreign influences on the student antiwar movement.<ref name="Theoharis06">{{cite book|title=The Central Intelligence Agency: Security Under Scrutiny |last=Athan Theoharis |first=Richard H. |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313332827 |pages=49,175,195,203,322}}</ref><ref name="Napoli05">{{cite book|title=Intelligence Identities Protection Act and Its Interpretation |first=Russell P. |last=Napoli |publisher=Nova Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=1594546851 |pages=18–20}}</ref> The "MH" designation is to signify the program had a worldwide area of operations.<ref name="Friedman05">{{cite book|title=The Secret Histories: Hidden Truths That Challenged the Past and Changed the World |first=John S. |last=Friedman |year=2005 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0312425171 |pages=278–279}}</ref> ==Parallel operations== During its time, Operation CHAOS made use of the facilities of other ongoing CIA domestic surveillance programs, many operating under the CIA's Office of Security, including:<ref name="Napoli05" /> *[[HTLINGUAL]] - Directed at letters passing between the United States and the then Soviet Union, the program involved the examination of correspondence to and from individuals or organizations placed on a watchlist. *Project 2 - Directed at infiltration of foreign intelligence targets by agents posing as dissident sympathizers and which, like CHAOS, had placed agents within domestic radical organizations for the purposes of training and establishment of dissident credentials. *[[Project MERRIMAC]] - Designed to infiltrate domestic antiwar and radical organizations thought to pose a threat to security of CIA property and personnel. *[[Project RESISTANCE]] - Worked with college administrators, campus security and local police to identify anti-war activists and [[political dissident]]s without any infiltration taking place *Domestic Contact Service - Focused on collecting foreign intelligence from willing Americans. ==History== When President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] came to office in 1969, all of the existing domestic surveillance activities were consolidated into Operation CHAOS.<ref name="Goldstein01">{{cite book|title=Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1976 |first=Robert Justin |last=Goldstein |year=2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0252069641 |page=456}}</ref> Operation CHAOS first used CIA stations abroad to report on antiwar activities of United States citizens traveling abroad, employing methods such as physical surveillance and electronic [[eavesdropping]], utilizing "liaison services" in maintaining such surveillance. The operations were later expanded to include 60 officers.<ref name="Friedman05" /> In 1969, following the expansion, the operation began developing its own network of [[informants]] for the purposes of infiltrating various foreign antiwar groups located in foreign countries that might have ties to domestic groups.<ref name="Napoli05" /> Eventually, CIA officers expanded the program to include other leftist or counter-cultural groups with no discernible connection to [[Vietnam]], such as groups operating within the [[History_of_feminism#Late_twentieth_century:_the_postwar_period_and_the_second_wave|women's liberation movement]].<ref name="Theoharis06" /> The domestic spying of Operation CHAOS also targeted the [[Israel]]i embassy, and domestic Jewish groups such as the [[B'nai B'rith]]. In order to gather intelligence on the embassy and B'nai B'rith, the CIA purchased a [[Waste collection|garbage collection]] company to collect documents that
