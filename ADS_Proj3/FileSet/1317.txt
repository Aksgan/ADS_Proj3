of which conducts alternately (push–pull) for exactly 180° (or half cycle) of the input signal; selective RF amplifiers can also be implemented using a single active element.</p><p>These amplifiers are subject to ''crossover distortion'' if the transition from one active element to the other is not perfect, as when two complementary transistors (i.e., one PNP, one NPN) are connected as two emitter followers with their base and emitter terminals in common, requiring the base voltage to slew across the region where both devices are turned off.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Art of Electronics | author = Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | isbn = 0521370957 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&pg=PA411&dq=crossover-distortion+class-b&lr=&as_brr=0&ei=v7nlR4CCDZaytgOT7IzZBA&sig=Dj6XntJelOmRA80c0IMp9gcG01s }}</ref></p> ;Class AB :Here the two active elements conduct more than half of the time as a means to reduce the cross-over distortions of class B amplifiers. In the example of the complementary emitter followers a bias network allows for more or less quiescent current thus providing an operating point somewhere between class A and class B. Sometimes a figure is added (e.g., AB<sub>1</sub> or AB<sub>2</sub>) for [[vacuum tube]] stages where the grid voltage is always negative with respect to the cathode (class AB<sub>1</sub>) or may be slightly positive (hence drawing grid current, adding more distortion, but giving slightly higher output power) on signal peaks (class AB<sub>2</sub>); another interpretation being higher figures implying a higher quiescent current and therefore more of the properties of class A.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} ;Class C :Less than 50% of the input signal is used (conduction angle Θ < 180°). The advantage is potentially high efficiency, but a disadvantage is high distortion. ;Class D {{Main|Switching amplifier}} :These use switching to achieve a very high power efficiency (more than 90% in modern designs). By allowing each output device to be either fully on or off, losses are minimized. The analog output is created by [[pulse-width modulation]]; i.e., the active element is switched on for shorter or longer intervals instead of modifying its resistance. There are more complicated switching schemes like [[Delta-sigma modulation|sigma-delta modulation]], to improve some performance aspects like lower distortions or better efficiency. ;Additional classes :There are several other amplifier classes, although they are mainly variations of the previous classes. For example, class G and class H amplifiers are marked by variation of the supply rails (in discrete steps or in a continuous fashion, respectively) following the input signal. Wasted heat on the output devices can be reduced as excess voltage is kept to a minimum. The amplifier that is fed with these rails itself can be of any class. These kinds of amplifiers are more complex, and are mainly used for specialized applications, such as very high-power units. Also, class E and class F amplifiers are commonly described in literature for radio frequencies applications where efficiency of the traditional classes in are important, yet several aspects not covered elsewhere (e.g.: amplifiers often simply said to have a gain of x dB - so what power gain?) deviate substantially from their ideal values. These classes use harmonic tuning of their output networks to achieve higher efficiency and can be considered a subset of Class C due to their conduction angle characteristics. The classes can be most easily understood using the diagrams in each section below. For the sake of illustration, a [[bipolar junction transistor]] is shown as the amplifying device, but in practice this could be a [[MOSFET]] or vacuum tube device. In an analog amplifier (the most common kind), the signal is applied to the input terminal of the device (base, gate or grid), and this causes a proportional output drive [[electric current|current]] to flow out of the output terminal. The output drive current comes from the power supply. === Class A === [[File:Electronic Amplifier Class A.png|thumb|Class A amplifier]] Amplifying devices operating in class A conduct <!-- CONDUCT is the important word here, not just "operate" --> over the whole of the input cycle such that the output signal is an exact scaled-up replica of the input with no clipping. A ''class A amplifier'' is distinguished by the ''output stage'' being biased into class A (see definition above). ==== Advantages of class A amplifiers ==== * Class A designs are simpler than other classes; for example class AB and B designs require two devices ([[push-pull output]]) to handle both halves of the waveform; class A can use a single device [[single-ended]]. * The amplifying element is biased so the device is always conducting to some extent, normally implying the quiescent (small-signal) collector current (for [[transistor]]s; drain current for [[FET]]s or anode/plate current for [[vacuum tube]]s) is close to the most linear portion of its [[transconductance]] curve. * Because the device is never shut off completely there is no "turn on" time, little problem with charge storage, and generally better high frequency performance and feedback loop stability (and usually fewer high-order harmonics). * The point at which the device comes closest to being cut off is not close to zero signal, so the problem of [[crossover distortion]] associated with class AB and B designs is avoided. ==== Disadvantage of class A amplifiers ==== * They are very inefficient; a theoretical maximum of 50% is obtainable with inductive output coupling and only 25% with capacitive coupling, unless [[Square law output stage]]s are used. In a power amplifier this not only wastes power and limits battery operation, it may place restrictions on the output devices that can be used (for example: ruling out some audio triodes if modern low-efficiency [[loudspeakers]] are to be used), and will increase costs. Inefficiency comes not just from the fact that the device is always conducting to some extent (that happens even with class AB, yet its efficiency can be close to that of class B); it is that the standing current is roughly half the maximum output current (although this can be less with [[Square law output stage]]), together with the problem that a large part of the power supply voltage is developed across
