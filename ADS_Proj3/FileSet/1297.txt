"The Personnel Evaluation Standards"<ref>Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1988). "[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PERSTNDS-SUM.htm The Personnel Evaluation Standards: How to Assess Systems for Evaluating Educators.]" Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.</ref> was published in 1988, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition)<ref>Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1994).''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PGMSTNDS-SUM.htm The Program Evaluation Standards, 2nd Edition.]'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.</ref> was published in 1994, and ''The Student Evaluation Standards''<ref>Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (2003). ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/briefing/ses/ The Student Evaluation Standards: How to Improve Evaluations of Students.]'' Newbury Park, CA: Corwin Press.</ref> was published in 2003. Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance. == Summary table of the main theoretical frameworks == The following table summarizes the main ''theoretical frameworks'' behind almost all the theoretical and research work, and the instructional practices in education (one of them being, of course, the practice of assessment). These different frameworks have given rise to interesting debates among scholars. {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- ! TOPICS ! EMPIRICISM ! RATIONALISM ! SOCIOCULTURALISM |- | '''Philosophical orientation''' | [[David Hume|Hume]]: [[Empiricism|British empiricism]] | [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]]: [[Rationalism|Continental rationalism]] | [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]]: [[Dialectic|cultural dialectic]] |- | '''Metaphorical Orientation''' | Mechanistic/Operation of a Machine or Computer | Organismic/Growth of a Plant | Contextualist/Examination of a Historical Event |- | '''Leading Theorists''' | [[B.

Qualitatively identical to lower animals, but quantitatively superior. | Organ that evolved to acquire knowledge by making sense of the world. Uniquely human, qualitatively different from lower animals. | Unique among species for developing language, tools, and education. |- | '''Nature of Knowledge''' (epistemology) | Hierarchically organized associations that present an accurate but incomplete representation of the world. Assumes that the sum of the components of knowledge is the same as the whole. Because knowledge is accurately represented by components, one who demonstrates those components is presumed to know | General and/or specific cognitive and conceptual structures, constructed by the mind and according to rational criteria. Essentially these are the higher-level structures that are constructed to assimilate new info to existing structure and as the structures accommodate more new info. Knowledge is represented by ability to solve new problems. | Distributed across people, communities, and physical environment. Represents culture of community that continues to create it. To know means to be attuned to the constraints and affordances of systems in which activity occurs. Knowledge is represented in the regularities of successful activity. |- | '''Nature of Learning''' (the process by which knowledge is increased or modified) | Forming and strengthening cognitive or S-R associations. Generation of knowledge by (1) exposure to pattern, (2) efficiently recognizing and responding to pattern (3) recognizing patterns in other contexts. | Engaging in active process of making sense of ("rationalizing") the environment. Mind applying existing structure to new experience to rationalize it. You don't really learn the components, only structures needed to deal with those components later. | Increasing ability to participate in a particular community of practice. Initiation into the life of a group, strengthening ability to participate by becoming attuned to constraints and affordances. |- | '''Features of Authentic Assessment''' | Assess knowledge components. Focus on mastery of many components and fluency. Use psychometrics to standardize. | Assess extended performance on new problems. Credit varieties of excellence. | Assess participation in inquiry and social practices of learning (e.g. portfolios, observations) Students should participate in assessment process. Assessments should be integrated into larger environment. |} ==Controversy== Concerns over how best to apply assessment practices across public school systems have largely focused on questions about the use of high stakes testing and standardized tests, often used to gauge student progress, teacher quality, and school-, district-, or state-wide educational success. ===No Child Left Behind=== For most researchers and practitioners, the question is not whether tests should be administered at all—there is a general consensus that, when administered in useful ways, tests can offer useful information about student progress and curriculum implementation, as well as offering formative uses for learners.<ref name="APA">American Psychological Association. "Appropriate Use of High-Stakes Testing in Our Nation's Schools." APA Online, available at <!--<s>www.apa.org/pubinfo/testing.html. Retrieved January 29, 2009.</s> Unnecessary to leave this here.--> [http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/brochures/testing.aspx APA.org], Retrieved January 24, 2010</ref> The real issue, then, is whether testing practices as currently implemented can provide these services for educators and students. In the U.S., the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] mandates standardized testing nationwide. These tests align with state curriculum and link teacher, student, district, and state accountability to the results of these tests. Proponents of NCLB argue that it offers a tangible method of gauging educational success, holding teachers and schools accountable for failing scores, and closing the [[achievement gap]] across class and ethnicity.<ref>(nd) [http://www.ed.gov/nclb/landing.jhtml Reauthorization of NCLB].
