The EcoCyc project performs literature-based curation of the ''E. coli'' genome, and of ''E. coli'' transcriptional regulation, transporters, and metabolic pathways. EcoCyc is a regularly updated electronic encyclopedia that contains written summaries of ''E. coli'' genes, distilled from more than 16,000 scientific articles. EcoCyc is also a computable description of the genome and cellular networks of ''E. coli'' that supports data mining and computational analyses. Objects in the EcoCyc database describe each ''E. coli'' gene and gene product. Database objects also describe molecular interactions, including metabolic pathways, transport events, and the regulation of gene expression. EcoCyc provides several genome-scale visualization tools to aid in the analysis of omics data, such as by painting gene expression or metabolomics data onto the full regulatory network of E. coli. EcoCyc can be accessed through the EcoCyc web site, as a set of downloadable files, and in conjunction with the Pathway Tools software that can be installed locally on Macintosh, PC/Windows, and PC/Linux computers. The downloadable software provides capabilities that go well beyond the web version of EcoCyc. ==External links== * [http://ecocyc.org/ EcoCyc] * [http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/ Pathway Tools] {{bioinformatics-stub}} [[Category:Biological databases]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11640</id> <title>EconMult</title> <text>'''EconMult''' is a general [[fishing fleet|fleet]] [[model (abstract)|model]] to be used in [[fishery|fisheries]] modelling. EconMult has been developed since 1991 as a part of the Multispecies management programme by the [[Norwegian Research Council]] at the [[Norwegian College of Fishery Science]] ([[University of Tromsø]], [[Norway]]). ==Model resolution and key variables== EconMult is a [[discrete time]] [[simulation]] model where the fleet activity is controlled by two [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]: ''Number of vessels ('''v''')'' (within each fleet segment) and ''Number of fishing days '''d''')'' (within each time interval). ''The biomass units'' ('''''x''''') are exogenous variables. The model resolution is determined by four structural variables: ''Number of fleet groups '''j''')'', ''Number of targeted species '''n''')'', ''Number of biomass units '''i''')'' (which may be more than one within each targeted species) and ''Period length'' (time step in the simulation). The number of vessels and fishing days therefore are presented in fleet (columns)-targeted species (rows) matrices, while the biomass units is presented in a column vector ('''''X'''''): <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><math> V = \begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} & \cdots & v_{1,n} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ v_{j,1} & \cdots & v_{j,n} \end{pmatrix} </math> </td><td> </td><td> <math> D = \begin{pmatrix} d_{1,1} & \cdots & d_{1,n} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ d_{j,1} & \cdots & d_{j,n} \end{pmatrix} </math> </td><td> </td><td> <math>X = \begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\ \vdots \\ x_{i} \end{pmatrix}</math> </td><td> </td><td> <math>i \ge n > 0</math><br><math>j > 0 \,\!</math> </td></tr></table> ==Catch production== A ''Fishery'' is in EconMult defined as a unique Fleet/Targeted species combination. The total catch within each fishery may include all biomass units defined in the model. Each biomass unit vessel catch is computed by [[Cobb-Douglas]] [[production function]], applying two input variables: ''Number of fishing days '''d''')'' and ''Biomass unit '''x''')''. In the matrix below each column represents a fleet group and each row a targeted species so each element in the matrix is a fishery and gives the vessel catch of the biomass units represented. The biomass units represent all the targeted species. Each catch is represented a Cobb-Douglas production equation as shown in the vessel yield matrix (Y): <math> Y_{V} = \begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} q_{1,1,1} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,1,i} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,1,i}} \end{pmatrix} & \cdots & \begin{pmatrix} q_{1,n,1} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,n,i} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,n,i}} \end{pmatrix} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \begin{pmatrix} q_{j,1,1} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,1,i} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,1,i}} \end{pmatrix} & \cdots & \begin{pmatrix} q_{j,n,1} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,n,i} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,n,i}} \end{pmatrix} \end{pmatrix} </math> The corresponding fleet catches are <math> Y = \begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} q_{1,1,1} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,1}} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,1,i} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,i}} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,1,i}} \end{pmatrix} & \cdots & \begin{pmatrix} q_{1,n,1} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,1}} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,n,i} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,i}} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,n,i}} \end{pmatrix} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \begin{pmatrix} q_{j,1,1} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,1}} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,1,i} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,i}} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,1,i}} \end{pmatrix} & \cdots & \begin{pmatrix} q_{j,n,1} d_{j,n}
