with 13 leaves and 13 olives. The clouds surrounding the constellation were made a complete circle for the first time.<ref name="statepub"/> The resulting die was made of steel, was 3 inches wide, and weighed one pound six ounces.<ref name="totten"/> In a letter accompanying their designs, Tiffany gave their reasonings behind various elements. The eagle was made as realistic as the rules of heraldry would permit, and the scroll style was chosen to least interfere with the eagle. There were no stars in the [[chief (heraldry)|chief]] (the area at the top of the shield), as is sometimes seen, as there are none specified in the blazon and thus including them would violate the rules of heraldry. Some had suggested allowing the rays of the sun to extend through the clouds, as appears to be specified in the original law and sometimes seen in other versions, but Whitehouse rejected that idea and kept with the traditional die representation. He also considered adding flowers to the olive branch, but decided against it, as "the unspecified number of flowers would be assumed to mean something when it would not".<ref name="hunt1909"/> Tiffany also submitted a design for the reverse of the seal, but even though Congress had ordered one a die was not created. The members of the consulting group were somewhat disparaging of even the design of the obverse, but especially critical of the reverse, and suggested not making it at all. Dwight eventually agreed and did not order the die, though he said it was "not improper" that one eventually be made.<ref name="hunt1909"/> To this day, there has never been an official die made of the reverse. ===1904 die=== [[File:USGreatSeal1904DieDrawing.png|thumb|1904 die design]] After only 17 years, the seal was no longer making a good impression (probably due to a worn counterdie).<ref name="statepub"/> On July 1, 1902, Congress passed an act to appropriate $1250 to have the seal recut. There was some discussion among State Department officials whether to redo the design again, but given the thought that had gone into the 1885 version, it was decided to recreate that design. Congress renewed the law on March 3, 1903, since no action had yet been taken, and this time specified that it be recut from the existing model which ended any further discussion.<ref name="hunt1909"/> [[File:1904 US Great Seal die.jpg|thumb|left|130px|1904 die]] The die was engraved by Max Zietler of the Philadelphia firm of Baily Banks & Biddle in 1903 (and is thus sometimes called the 1903 die), but final delivery was delayed until January 1904 due to issues with the press. There were slight differences; the impressions were sharper, the feathers more pointed, and the talons have shorter joints. Also, two small heraldic errors which had persisted on all previous seal dies were fixed:<ref name="statepub"/> the rays of the glory were drawn with dots to [[hatching system|indicate the tincture]] gold, and the background of the stars was drawn with horizontal lines to indicate azure.<ref>''The Eagle and the Shield'', p. 308</ref> The die was first used on January 26, 1904, and was used for 26 years. All dies made since have followed exactly the same design, and in 1986 the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] made a master die from which all future dies will be made.<ref name="statepub"/> The current die is the seventh, and was made in 1986.<ref name="gsdies">{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/committees/dies.html|title=Official Dies of the Great Seal of the United States|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> ===Dorsett seal=== [[File:US Dorsett seal.jpg|thumb|Dorsett seal, reversed photo]] In 1894 Palemon Howard Dorsett, a lifelong Department of Agriculture employee, turned up at the Department of State with a metal die engraved with the Great Seal claiming it had originally been given to his family by a nephew of [[George Washington]]. It was examined by [[Gaillard Hunt]], the author of a pamphlet on the Great Seal, who agreed that it appeared to be contemporaneous with the original 1782 seal but took no further interest in the matter.<ref name="gsdorsett">{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/presidents/index.html|title=The Mystery of George Washington and the Dorsett Seal|publisher=greatseal.com|first=John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Decades later in 1936, Dorsett wrote again regarding his die, and this time it was investigated more thoroughly. It is a very similar design to the first Great Seal die and obviously copied from it, even including a border of acanthus leaves. The eagle was different though, being more spirited with its wings more widely outspread. More significantly, the arrows and the olive branch are switched, indicating an intentional "[[Heraldry#Differencing_and_cadency|difference]]" to distinguish it from the actual Great Seal. It is the same size as the first die, and is made of bronze. There was no indication that it could actually be used in a seal press, and a search of government documents showed no use of the seal anywhere.<ref name="gsdorsetthist">{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Richard S.|coauthors=Richardson Dougall|title=The Eagle and the Shield|url=http://www.greatseal.com/presidents/DorsettSealHistory.pdf|format=PDF|pages=409â€“417|chapter=The Mystery of George Washington and the "Dorsett Seal"|year=1978|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|oclc=4268298}}</ref> The investigation also turned up some facts which supported Dorsett's story: documents relating to the sale of Washington's estate list "plates arms U.S." being sold to Thomas Hammond (a son-in-law of [[Charles Washington]] and therefore a nephew by marriage to George Washington), and also the Hammond and Dorsett families both had roots in West Virginia just a few miles apart. Afterwards Dorsett loaned his seal to [[Mount Vernon]], and his heirs made it a donation. It was eventually put on display in a museum there.<ref name="gsdorsetthist"/> The origins and purpose of this die remain unknown. Both Hunt and the authors of ''Eagle and the Shield'' speculate it was meant to be used by either the President of the Congress or later by the President of the United States, but there is no other evidence to support this.<ref name="gsdorsett"/> In October and November 2007, two more dies were discovered in Rhode Island with exactly the same design (though cut in relief), even down to the same small flaws. They were made of silver-plated lead, which is sometimes used as an engraving test since it is a cheaper metal.<ref name="gsdorsett"/> ==Notable depictions== The Great Seal very quickly became a popular
