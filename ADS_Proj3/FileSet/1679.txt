basic biological research and its applications in medicine and other fields. The GSA also strives to inform state and national legislators about advances and issues in genetics. ===Interaction among geneticists=== The GSA organizes and sponsors several conferences for researchers. These include the long-running model organism meetings: Yeast (biennial), C. elegans (biennial), Fungal (biennial) and Drosophila (annual meetings), and the new Society-wide Model Organisms to Human Biology meeting (biennial). The Meetings and Membership Committee welcomes opportunities to sponsor other meetings appropriate to its mission. GENEtics, the Society’s newsletter (published three times a year), keeps members apprised of Society activities. ===Communication of discoveries=== The GSA publishes ''GENETICS'', the leading journal for geneticists since the first issue in 1916. The GSA is also exploring new opportunities for scientific communication, such as those offered by the organism-specific genetic databases. ===Education of students and the public=== The GSA’s Education Committee seeks to facilitate the integration of advances in genetics in the K through college curriculum. The GSA communicates to the public advances in genetics and answers to issues by providing expert opinion to the press and others. The Genetics Society of America recognizes outstanding geneticists with following awards: *The [[Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal]] for lifetime contributions to the field of genetics *The Genetics Society of America Medal for outstanding contributions to the field of genetics in the last 15 years *The George W. Beadle Award for outstanding contributions to the community of genetics researchers *The Elizabeth W. Jones Award for Excellence in Education in recognition of significant and sustained impact on genetics education *The [[Edward Novitski]] Prize in recognition of extraordinarly creativity and ingenuity in solving problems in genetics. *The DeLill Nasser Awards for Professional Development in Genetics for young geneticists to attend national and international meetings and enroll in laboratory courses. ==External links== *[http://www.genetics-gsa.org/ Genetics Society of America] [[Category:American professional bodies]] [[Category:Genetics organizations]] [[Category:Biology organizations]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15050</id> <title>Genie Engine</title> <text>[[Image:Age of empires.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Age of Empires]] using the Genie Engine]] [[File:Rise of Rome new features.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome|The Rise of Rome]] using the Genie Engine]] [[File:Age ii feudal age celts.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Age of Empires II]] using the Genie Engine]] [[File:Age of Empires 2 Screenshot.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors|The Conquerors]] using the Genie Engine]] The '''Genie Engine''' is a [[game engine]] developed by [[Ensemble Studios]] and used in several popular [[Personal computer game|computer games]], such as ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'', ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings|Age of Empires II]]'' and its [[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors|expansion]] (but is not used in other Ensemble Studios games) and ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]''. Some of those games have been ported to the [[Apple Mac]]. ==Development== The Genie engine was developed as the basis for [[Ensemble Studios]] first game, ''[[Age of Empires]]'' which had the development name of "Dawn of Man".<ref>{{cite book|last=Grossman|first=Austin|title=Postmortems from Game Developer|publisher=Focal Press|year=2003|isbn=1578202140}}</ref> The designers received much of their inspiration from the game ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'', with its proven historical setting; this was noted among reviewers as something positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind.htm|title=Behind the Scenes|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> ''Age of Empires'' was designed by [[Bruce Shelley]],.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_bruce.htm|title=Behind the Scenes: Bruce Shelly|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Tony Goodman (in charge of the game's artwork),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_tony.htm|title=Behind the Scenes: Tony Goodman|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> and [[Dave Pottinger]] (in charge of the game's [[artificial intelligence]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_dave.htm|title=Behind the Scenes: Dave Pottinger|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> The game was described as "''[[Civilization II]]'' meets ''[[Warcraft II]]''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/pc/strategy/ageofempires.htm |title=Build an Empire to Surpass Microsoft's|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|author=Daniel Gies|accessdate=2008-02-24|date=November 1997}}</ref> and this shows in the game's engine design. Like ''Warcraft'' it is [[real time strategy]] but unlike ''Warcraft'' and like ''[[Civilization II]]'' it is historical and has an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] perspective. The sequel's, ''The Age of Kings'', design team intended to complete the game within a year by using [[source code|code]] from the original and reusing the [[Genie (game engine)|Genie]] [[game engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/gdcarchive/2000/terrano.doc |title=The Art of Empires|format=[[.doc]]|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref> Several months into the process they found they would not be able to complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created ''[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome]]'', an easily-developed expansion pack of ''Age of Empires'', as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_01.htm|title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings - Catching Up|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Matt Pritchard |date=2000-03-07|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref> To help meet the next year's deadline, additional [[programmer]]s, artists, and designers were employed.<ref name="Matt Pritchard">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_02.htm |title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings — What Went Right|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Matt Pritchard|date=2000-03-07|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref> The original ''Age of Empires'' had been criticized for its [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).

For ''The Age of Kings'', Ensemble Studios attempted to develop a more powerful AI system that did not compromise by cheating. Industry veteran Mario Grimani led Ensemble Studios in the creation of the new system. To overcome another significant objection to ''Age of Empires''—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the [[game engine]]'s movement system.<ref name="Matt Pritchard"/> The AI will still cheat at higher setting, giving itself extra resources every so many minutes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The team was less successful in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following the release of ''Age of Empires'' that there was still no process by which [[patch (gaming)|patches]] could be issued. Extensive [[Cheating in video games|cheating]] in multiplayer games of ''Age of Empires'' came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for ''The Age of Kings''. On release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.<ref name="Gama3">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_03.htm |title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings — What Went Wrong|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Matt Pritchard|date=2000-03-07|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref><ref name="MSDls">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/age2/downloads.htm |title=Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings Downloads|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> Ensemble Studios developed a
