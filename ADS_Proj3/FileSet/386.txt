with Louis' help, she is able to defeat him just as Treville and the others arrive. Philippe, his men and Brutus (who fought against Miette and lost) are all arrested and taken away. Louis thanks the girls and Treville apologizes for not believing them. After his coronation, the newly made King Louis rewards Corinne, Viveca, Aramina, and Renée for their bravery by making them the first female Musketeers in history. Their families, fellow Musketeers and the citizens of Paris congratulate the girls. Héléne also attends the ceremony as the new overseer of the palace servants while Madame de Bossé is now a kitchen maid. Louis later invites Corinne to take another balloon ride with him, but the celebration is interrupted when the Musketeers are informed of a plot against the new king. Corinne tells Louis to hold on to the balloon ride offer as she runs to join her friends. Corrine, Viveca, Aramina and Renée all ride into the sunset, lifting their swords and exclaiming "[[Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno|All for one, and one for all]]!" === Allusion to the original story === {{Trivia|date=October 2010}}{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2010}}{{Original research|section|date=October 2010}} *While speaking to Treville, Corinne says her father's name is D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan is the one of the protagonists in the original novel *Like the hot-blooded D'Artagnan, Corinne is shown as a brave and feisty young woman who gets angry when people tell her that girls can’t be Musketeers. *Alexander, Corinne's horse, is a nod to the author of the Three Musketeers novel, [[Alexandre Dumas]]. *When the other girls invited Corinne to stay with them, Viveca mentions that their former roommate was Constance. In the novel, Constance Bonacieux is the woman that D'Artagnan falls in love with. *One of the guests at the masquerade ball is introduced as the Countess De Winter, who was one of the antagonists from the original story. *Monsieur Treville, the captain of the Musketeers in the film, is named after the captain in the original story, Monsieur de Treville. *The part when Corinne accidentally falls on each of three girls and makes them angry is similar to the part in the novel when D'Artagnan accidentally ends up falling into each of the Musketeers and making them challenge him to the duel. *Corinne’s hometown is Gascony, which is the name of D’Artagnan’s family estate in the novel. *Prince Louis is named after King Louis XIII from the novel. *Tim Curry, who voices Philippe in the film, also played the villainous Cardinal Richelieu in the 1993 Disney version of The Three Musketeers. The film also stars Charlie Sheen as Aramis, Kiefer Sutherland as Athos, Oliver Platt as Porthos and Chris O'Donnell as D'Artagnan. *The famous fleur-de-lis, which was branded on the villainess Milady de Winter in the story, is on the fronts of the tunics worn by the Musketeers in the film. *Aramina appears to be named after Aramis, another protagonist from the novel. *However, Aramis' first name was Rene, so Renee appears to have been named after him, too. *Paris, which is France’s capital city and the center location of the original story, is also the location for the film. * In the original novel, D'Artagnan's father gives him a pony. And Corrine's mom gives her 15 crowns and the horse just like in the novel. ==Reception== ===Reviews=== CommonSenseMedia's review gave the movie three stars out of five and concluded: "A pretty good try, but this Musketeer misses the mark...Barbie does all kinds of acrobatic moves, which flaunt her girlishness, but putting a sword in her dainty little hands seems to be a stretch."<ref>[http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/barbie-and-three-musketeers/details Barbie and the Three Musketeers] By Joly Herman</ref> DVDverdict's review said the CGI was not spectacular and adults would not find much to cheer about. However, children would find it "fine and dandy. It has no offensive material, and promotes the idea girls can be anything they want if given a chance and the right accessories."<ref>[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/barbie3musketeers.php Reviewed by Judge Brett Cullum]</ref> [[DVD Talk]]'s review rated the content worth two stars out of five (but three for video and audio) but advised "Rent it" due in part to the songs. "Unfortunately, some distasteful songs run throughout this speedy retelling of the Dumas classic, so be forewarned...Not only are the lyrics ugly, they're senseless."<ref>[http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39562/barbie-and-the-three-musketeers/ Review by Paul Mavis]</ref> === Reception === The movie was released on DVD on September 15, 2009 and opened at #2, selling 399,000 units which translated to $5.6 million in sales.

Like a [[flatbed scanner]], it consists of a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones. Additionally, nearly all barcode readers contain ''decoder'' circuitry analyzing the barcode's image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode's content to the scanner's output port. == Types of barcode readers == === Methods === Scanning methods are distinguished by the amount of operator manipulation required: * Pen or wand-type readers: requires the operator to swipe the pen over the
