reduction to the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. This theorem generalizes the standard ham sandwich theorem by letting <math>f(s,x) = s_0 + s_1 x_1 + \cdots + s_n x_n</math>. Their second formulation is as follows: for any ''n''+1 measurable functions ''f''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> over ''X'' that are [[linearly independent]] over any subset of ''X'' of positive measure, there is a [[linear combination]] <math>f = a_0 f_0 + a_1 f_1 + \cdots + a_n f_n</math> such that the surface <math>f(x) = 0</math>, dividing ''X'' into <math>f(x) < 0</math> and <math>f(x) > 0</math>, simultaneously bisects the outer measure of ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. This theorem generalizes the standard ham sandwich theorem by letting <math>f_0(x) = 1</math> and letting <math>f_i(x)</math>, for <math>i > 0</math>, be the ''i''th coordinate of ''x''. ==Discrete and computational geometry versions== [[Image:Discrete ham sandwich cut.svg|thumb|right|A ham-sandwich cut of eight red points and seven blue points in the plane.]] In [[discrete geometry]] and [[computational geometry]], the ham sandwich theorem usually refers to the special case in which each of the sets being divided is a [[finite set]] of [[point (geometry)|point]]s. Here the relevant measure is the [[counting measure]], which simply counts the number of points on either side of the hyperplane. In two dimensions, the theorem can be stated as follows: :For a finite set of points in the plane, each colored "red" or "blue", there is a [[line (mathematics)|line]] that simultaneously bisects the red points and bisects the blue points, that is, the number of red points on either side of the line is equal and the number of blue points on either side of the line is equal. There is an exceptional case when a point lies on the line. In this situation, we count the point as being on either both sides of the line or on neither side of the line. This exceptional case is actually required for the theorem to hold, in case the number of red points or the number of blue is odd, and still each set must be bisected. In computational geometry, this ham sandwich theorem leads to a computational problem, the '''ham sandwich problem'''. In two dimensions, the problem is this: given a finite set of ''n'' points in the plane, each colored "red" or "blue", find a ham sandwich cut for them. First, Megiddo (1985) described an algorithm for the special, separated case. Here all red points are on one side of some line and all blue points are on the other side, a situation where there is a unique ham sandwich cut, which Megiddo could find in linear time. Later, Edelsbrunner and Waupotitsch (1986) gave an algorithm for the general two-dimensional case; the running time of their algorithm is O(''n'' log ''n''). Finally, Lo and Steiger (1990) found an optimal ''[[Big O notation|O]]''(''n'')-time [[algorithm]]. This algorithm was extended to higher dimensions by Lo, [[Jiří Matoušek (mathematician)|Matoušek]], and Steiger (1994). Given ''d'' sets of points in general position in ''d''-dimensional space, the algorithm computes a (''d''−1)-dimensional hyperplane that has equal numbers of points of each of the sets in each of its half-spaces, i.e., a ham-sandwich cut for the given points. ==References== *{{citation | doi = 10.2307/4145019 | last1 = Beyer | first1 = W.
