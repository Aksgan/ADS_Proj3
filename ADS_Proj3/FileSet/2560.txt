It offers a range of text-based information, typically including national, international and sporting news, weather and TV schedules. [[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitle]] (or [[closed captioning]]) information is also transmitted in the teletext signal, typically on page 888<ref>{{citebook|title=Digital Journalism: Emerging Media and the Changing Horizons of Journalism|first=Kevin |last=Kawamoto|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year= 2003|id=ISBN 074252681X|page=32}}</ref> or 777. A number of similar teletext services were developed in other countries, some of which attempted to address the limitations of the British-developed system, with its simple graphics and fixed page sizes. ==France: Antiope== {{Main|Antiope (teletext)}} In France, where the [[SECAM]] standard is used in television broadcasting, a teletext system was developed in the late 1970s under the name ''Antiope''. It had a higher data rate and was capable of dynamic page sizes, allowing more sophisticated graphics. It was phased out in favour of standard teletext in 1991. ==Canada: Telidon== {{Main|Telidon}} The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] ran a teletext service, IRIS, accessible only in [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]]. It ran from 1983 until about 1986, and used the Canadian-developed [[Telidon]] system, which was developed in 1980. Like Antiope, Telidon allowed significantly higher graphic resolution than standard teletext. ==Russian Federation== In the Russian Federation teletext service operates on Channel One, Channel "TV Centre", and many regional cable channels. [[Image:Teletext of tvcenter.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of Teletext on [[TV Center]], TV does not support Cyrillic]] <br/> ==United States== Adoption in the United States was hampered due to a lack of a single teletext standard and consumer resistance to the high initial price of teletext decoders. Throughout the period of analogue broadcasting, teletext or other similar technologies in the USA were practically non-existent, with the only technologies resembling such existing in the country being [[closed captioning]], [[TV Guide On Screen]], and [[Extended Data Services]] (XDS). ===Early tests=== A version of the European teletext standard designed to work with the [[NTSC]] television standard used in [[North America]] was first demonstrated in the USA in 1978 by station [[KSL-TV|KSL]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], premiered a teletext service using Ceefax. They were followed by [[United States|American]] television network [[CBS]], which decided to try both the British [[Ceefax]] and French [[Antiope (teletext)|Antiope]] software for preliminary tryouts for a teletext service, using station KMOX (now [[KMOV]]) in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] as a testing ground.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19790516&id=DwEMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=21gDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6334,14832 Teletext: Soon You'll Be Punching Buttons And Talking Back To Your TV], ''[[Associated Press]]'' (syndicated), 16 May 1979</ref><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aj4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT17 KSL-TV's Teletext Testing Shows No Reception Problems], ''[[Infoworld]]'', 18 February 1980.

KCET's service also included service components for use in schools. ===NABTS=== {{Main|NABTS}} Later, an official North American standard of teletext, called [[NABTS]] (North American Broadcast Teletext Specification) was developed in the early 1980s by [[Norpak]], a Canadian company. NABTS provided improved graphic and text capability over WST, but was quite short-lived. This was mainly due to the expensive cost of NABTS decoders, costing in the thousands of dollars upon their release to the public. NABTS, however, was adopted for a short while by American TV networks [[NBC]] & [[CBS]] throughout the early-to-mid 80s, CBS using it for their short-lived [[ExtraVision]] teletext service, which premiered after the early Antiope & Ceefax trials by CBS & KNXT, and NBC, who had a NABTS-based service called [[NBC Teletext]] for a very short time in the mid-1980s. NBC discontinued their service in 1985 due to the cost of NABTS decoders not dropping to an affordable level for the consumer public.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7S4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21 NBC discontinues teletext], ''[[InfoWorld]]'', 11 February 1985, p. 21</ref> The NABTS protocol received a revival of sorts in the late 90s, when it was used for the [[datacasting]] features of [[WebTV for Windows]] under [[Windows 98]], and for [[Intel]]'s now-defunct [[InterCast]] service (also for Windows as well), using a proper [[TV tuner card]] (such as the [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] All-In-Wonder or [[Hauppauge Computer Works|Hauppauge]]'s Win-TV). ===World System Teletext=== {{Main|World System Teletext}} WST was also used for a short time in the USA, with services provided throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s by several regional American TV networks (such as the [[University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison]]'s ''Infotext'' service in the mid-1980s, which was carried on several TV stations across [[Wisconsin]], and Agtext, provided by [[Kentucky Educational Television]] and carried on KET's stations, both services providing agriculturally oriented information) and major-market U.S. TV stations (such as ''Metrotext'', which was formerly carried on station [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]], and ''KeyFax'', formerly on [[WFLD]] in [[Chicago]]). <!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:Zenith-electra.jpg|left|thumb|Electra teletext]] --> Perhaps the most prominent of American teletext providers was the ''[[Electra (teletext)|Electra]]'' teletext service, using WST, which was broadcast starting in the early 1980s on the vertical blanking interval ([[VBI]]) of the American cable channel [[TBS Superstation|WTBS]]. Electra was owned and operated by [[Taft
