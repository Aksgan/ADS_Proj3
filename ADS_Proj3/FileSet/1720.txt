The system must be capable of being transported by a C-130 aircraft. *Integrate and assess military utility of modular Global Observer payloads to address user identified gaps in ISR and communications relay. *Evaluate system life cycle costs. ==JCTD Sponsors== *U.S. Department of Defense *United States Special Operations Command *United States Strategic Command *U.S. Department of Homeland Security *U.S. Air Force *U.S. Army *U.S. Coast Guard *U.S. Defense Threat Reductions Agency ==Flight Test Partners== *Air Force Flight Test Center *NASA Dryden Flight Research Center ==Mission Possibilities== '''Communications Relay''' <br /> Global Observer offers satellite-like capabilities to enable affordable, persistent and seamless communications relay where mission operators need it most. It also provides more bandwidth to interconnect and route data, enabling teams separated by topographical barriers to communicate with each other and to distant command center in real time. '''Disaster Response''' <br /> Global Observer provides hurricane/storm tracking, weather monitoring and sustained support such as: evacuation planning, relief operations and first response coordination. With an advanced payload, Global Observer can provide alternative communications relay in the event assets such as: cell towers, microwave relays and satellite downlinks are damaged. '''Maritime Operations''' <br /> Global Observer can provide long-term surveillance over coastlines plagued by transport of illegal goods. This enables analysts to observe suspicious activity, determine patterns of behavior and identify threats to enable rapid and effective countermeasures/actions. ==Milestones== The technologies behind Global Observer have been developed over decades of innovation at AV, tracing back to the first human powered airplane and through a series of revolutionary extreme altitude, solar-powered UAS. Today Global Observer is poised to open the stratosphere for practical use in the same way that airplanes and satellites opened the skies and space during last century. '''1977 Gossamer Condor''': First human-powered airplane. Maximum efficiency in aeronautical and propulsion system design. '''1981 Solar Challenger:''' First solar-powered piloted airplane to cross the English Channel (5+ hour flight). High efficiency energy generation and storage. (Smithsonian) '''1993 Pathfinder:''' Groundbreaking solar-powered, high altitude UAS. Reached 50,000 feet in 1995. '''2001 Helios:''' Solar-powered, high altitude UAS sets world altitude record for non-rocket powered aircraft - 96,863 feet. '''2002 Pathfinder Plus:''' First successful relay of high-quality television signals, third-generation cell phone transmissions and Internet linkage from the stratosphere. (Smithsonian) '''2005 Global Observer “Odyssey Prototype”:''' First liquid hydrogen fueled UAS. 1/3 scale, powered by fuel cell system.

It is maintained by the [[United States]] government and is freely accessible by anyone with a GPS receiver. GPS was created and realized by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (USDOD) and was originally run with 24 satellites. It was established in 1973 to overcome the limitations of previous navigation systems.<ref>{{cite book |title=The global positioning system: a shared national asset : recommendations for technical improvements and enhancements |last1=National Research Council (U.S.).

The Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System ([[GLONASS]]) was for use by the Russian military only until 2007. There are also the planned Chinese [[Compass navigation system]] and [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]] of the European Union (EU). == History == {{double image|right|NAVSTAR GPS logo shield-official.jpg|90|50th Space Wing.png|90}} The design of GPS is based partly on similar ground-based radio navigation systems, such as [[LORAN]] and the [[Decca Navigator System|Decca Navigator]] developed in the early 1940s, and used during [[World War II]]. In 1956 [[Friedwardt Winterberg]]<ref>''Astronautica Acta II,'' 25 (1956)</ref> proposed a test of [[general relativity]] using accurate [[atomic clock]]s placed in orbit in artificial satellites. To achieve accuracy requirements, GPS uses principles of general relativity to correct the satellites' atomic clocks. Additional inspiration for GPS came when the [[Soviet Union]] launched the first man-made satellite, [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]] in 1957. A team of U.S. scientists led by Dr. Richard B. Kershner were monitoring Sputnik's radio transmissions. They discovered that, because of the [[Doppler effect]], the frequency of the signal being transmitted by Sputnik was higher as the satellite approached, and lower as it continued away from them. They realized that because they knew their exact location on the globe, they could pinpoint where the satellite was along its orbit by measuring the Doppler distortion (see [[Transit (satellite)]]).<!-- The converse is also true: if the satellite's position were known, they could identify their own position on Earth. (commented because I am not sure of this. At most, they would know the rate that the distance between themselves and the satellite was changing. There would be at least
