organiser is supported by members of the administrative council, in particular the conference liaison. Over the years, the association has developed the policy to circulate the conference location in such a way that southern, eastern, western, and northern parts of Europe are reached regularly – although this principle can only be maintained on the basis of available organisers. In the past years, the following CAADRIA conferences have been organised: {| class="wikitable" !Year !Place !Institution !Proceedings |- |2010 |Hong Kong, SAR |The School of Architecture & Institute of Space & Earth Information Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong | |- |2009 |Yunlin, Taiwan | Department of Digital Media Design and Graduate School of Computational Design, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology | |- |2008 |Chiang Mai, Thailand |Faculty of Architecture; Chiang Mai University | |- |2007 |Nanjing, China |Southeast University and Nanjing University | |- |2006 |Kumamoto, Japan |School of Architecture and Civil Engineering; Kumamoto University |ISBN 4907662017 |- |2005 |New Delhi, India |TVB School of Habitat Studies; Indraprastha University |ISBN 8190281607 (set) |- |2004 |Seoul, Korea |Institute of Millennium Environmental Design and Research; Yonsei University and The Korean Housing Association |ISBN 8971416483 |- |2003 |Bangkok, Thailand |Rangsit University |ISBN 9749584139 |- |2002 |Cyberjaya, Malaysia |Faculty of Creative Multimedia; Multimedia University Malaysia |ISBN 983247342X |- |2001 |Sydney, Australia |Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition, Faculty of Architecture; University of Sydney |ISBN 1864870966 |- |2000 |Singapore |Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture (CASA), School of Architecture, Faculty of Architecture, Building and Real Estate; National University of Singapore |ISBN 9810424914 |- |1999 |Shanghai, China |College of Architecture and Urban Planning; Tonji University |ISBN 7543912333 |- |1998 |Osaka, Japan |Sasada Laboratory, Department of Environmental Engineering; [[Osaka University]] |ISBN 4907662009 |- |1997 |Hsintsu, Taiwan |Architecture Group, Graduate School of Applied Arts; National Chiao-Tung University |ISBN 9575750578 |- |1996 |Hong Kong |HKU Department of Architecture; The University of Hong Kong |ISBN 9627757039 |} === Publications === ==== Proceedings ==== Each year the conference papers are gathered into a proceedings publication which is distributed to members, and available to the public via the organization's web site. ==== CumInCAD ==== [[CumInCAD]]<ref>[http://cumincad.scix.net/ Homepage of CumInCAD (Cumulative Index in CAAD)]</ref> is a cumulative index of publications about computer-aided architectural design. Full texts, in PDF, of CAADRIA proceedings are available through this archive. ==== International Journal of Architectural Computing ==== The International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC)<ref>[http://www.architecturalcomputing.org/ Homepage of International Journal of Architectural Computing]</ref> is an international, peer-reviewed academic journal in the area of CAAD. This journal was established as an international collaboration between the sister organisations and continues to be supported by those sister organisations, representatives of which are members of the editorial board. It is produced quarterly, both in print and online, and a special rate of subscription is available to all members of CAADRIA. === Awards and Fellowships === ==== CAADRIA Fellows ==== * [[John Gero]], [[University of Sydney]] * [[Thomas Kvan]], [[The University of Melbourne]] * [[Tsuyoshi Sasada]], [[Osaka University]] ==== Tee Sasada Award ==== The Sasada Award is instituted in the memory of Professor [[Tsuyoshi Sasada]] (1941-2005), Emeritus Professor at Osaka University, as well as co-founder and Fellow of CAADRIA. This award is given to an individual whose sustained record of contributions demonstrates or promises significant impact on the field of computer-aided design. In keeping with Tee’s spirit, the award recipient should have contributed to the next generation of researchers and academics, to the wider profession and practice in computer-aided design and research, and earned recognition in the peer community. The Sasada Award is announced and presented at the annual CAADRIA conference. The Award supports the winner to undertake an academic visit at the Osaka Lab and covers return airfare, accommodation and meals for one week. The Award recipient is expected to contribute to the academic and research activities at the Osaka Lab in the form of seminars and interaction with research students and staff. ==== Best Paper Award ==== The Best Paper Award Committee is organized at the conference site by the Exco member in charge of awards. The Site Coordinator identifies two local members who are appropriately qualified to join this committee. All papers printed in proceedings and presented at the conference are eligible for this award. The paper is awarded on the basis of the clarity of writing, good structure and argument, contribution to the field, a good conclusion, contribution and relevance to CAADRIA, use of appropriate illustrations and tables, and appropriate references. ==== Best Presentation Award ==== The Best Presentation Award Committee is organized at the conference site by the Exco member in charge of awards. The Site Coordinator identifies two local members who are appropriately qualified to join this committee. Only presentations made by one of the authors are eligible for this award. The presentations are awarded on the basis of: good use of time, how well-paced they are, good use of appropriate media, delivery, contribution and relevance to CAADRIA, and how well questions have been handled. ==== Young CAADRIA Award ==== Young CAADRIA Award is funded by CAADRIA and consists of a waiver of the conference delegation fees if the abstract is selected for a paper presentation. It is awarded on the basis of the CV provided. == Related Organisations == === Sister Organisations === CAADRIA is one of five sister organisations in [[CAAD]] worldwide that share the same mission: [[ACADIA]]<ref>[http://www.acadia.org Homepage of ACADIA (Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture)]</ref> (North America, founded 1981), [[SIGraDi]]<ref>[http://www.sigradi.org Homepage of SIGraDi (Sociedad Iberoamericana de Gráfica Digital)]</ref> (Ibero-America, founded 1997), [[eCAADe]]<ref>[http://www.ecaade.org Homepage of eCAADe (Association for Education and Research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe)]</ref> (Europe, founded 1983), and [[ASCAAD]]<ref>[http://www.ascaad.org Homepage of ASCAAD (Arab Society for Computer Aided Architectural Design)]</ref> (Arabic countries of west Asia, and North Africa, founded 2001). === Other organisations and resources === A strongly related organisation in the area of CAAD is the [[CAAD Futures Foundation]]<ref>[http://www.caadfutures.org Homepage of CAAD Futures Foundation]</ref> (global scope, founded 1985). == See also == * [[Comparison of CAD software]]
