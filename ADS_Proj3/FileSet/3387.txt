Version 2009.1 provides a USB installer to create a [[Live USB]], where the user's configuration and personal data can be saved if desired. A live USB of older versions of PCLinuxOS can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]] <ref>[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ UNetbootin - Homepage and Downloads] Retrieved on 2009-5-1</ref>. The entire CD can be run from memory, assuming the system has sufficient RAM. PCLinuxOS uses [[APT-RPM]], based on [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] (or APT), a [[package management system]] (originally from the [[Debian]] distribution), together with [[Synaptic Package Manager]], a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] front-end to APT, in order to add, remove or update [[package]]s. If there is enough memory on the machine, and an active network connection, the Live CD can update packages. PCLinuxOS is also designed to be easy to [[Software remastering|remaster]] after installation, creating one's own personalized Live CD, using the [[mklivecd]] tool. ==Mandriva Linux== Although it retains a similar "look and feel" to Mandriva Linux, PCLinuxOS has diverged significantly. The code was officially forked from Mandrake 9.2 into an independent project in 2003. After three years of continuous development, the developers took advantage of further development in (the renamed) Mandriva, and forked the code again late in 2006 for PCLinuxOS 2007. PCLinuxOS maintains its own software repository, available via the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) and its Synaptic front-end, completely replacing Mandriva's [[urpmi]]. This means that an installation could be continuously updated to the latest versions of packages, hence forgoing the need to re-install the entire distribution upon each successive release. In the releases before 2007, it was sometimes necessary to perform a re-installation. Other differences include its own menu arrangement, custom graphics, and icon sets. PCLinuxOS places specific emphasis on [[desktop computer|desktop computing]], concentrating its efforts for home or small business environments, hence paying less attention to other more "traditional" uses, like servers, although packages for most server tasks are available. ==Projects== There are several community projects associated with PCLinuxOS. ===MiniMe=== MiniMe is a minimal [[Live CD|"Live & Install" CD]] for experienced users wishing to add their own selection of packages. PCLinuxOS 2008 "MiniMe" edition was released on 2008-01-07.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pclinuxos.com/index.php?option=com_smf&Itemid=58&topic=38535.0|title=PCLinuxOS MiniMe 2008 Released|date=2008-01-07|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> ===PCLinuxOS Magazine=== The [http://www.pclosmag.com/html/enter.html PCLinuxOS Magazine project] is a community driven free publication focused on the users of PCLinuxOS by [http://www.mypclinuxos.com/ MyPCLinuxOS]. PCLinuxOS Magazine is published on a monthly basis. All content for the publication is solicited from the PCLinuxOS user base. ===Third-party distributions=== Since PCLinuxOS includes the [[mklivecd]] script, there are several third-party distributions based on PCLinuxOS: * [[Karoshi (operating system)|Karoshi]] * [http://www.bugnux.org BugnuX] - Based on a development version of Enlightenment * [http://belproject.org?title=Main_Page BEL Project] * [http://zen.pclinuxos.org.pl/ ZEN-mini Gnome] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Portal|Free software}} * [http://www.pclinuxos.com PCLinuxOS website] * {{DistroWatch|pclinuxos|NAME=PCLinuxOS}} * [http://pclinuxos-games.com PCLinuxOS Games] {{LXDE}} {{Linux distributions}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Pclinuxos}} [[Category:Live USB]] [[Category:KDE]] [[Category:RPM-based Linux distributions]] [[Category:Operating system distributions bootable from read-only media]] [[ar:بي سي لينكس أو إس]] [[bg:PCLinuxOS]] [[da:PCLinuxOS]] [[de:PCLinuxOS]] [[es:PCLinuxOS]] [[fa:پی‌سی‌لینوکس‌اواس]] [[fr:PCLinuxOS]] [[ko:PCLinuxOS]] [[id:PCLinuxOS]] [[it:PCLinuxOS]] [[he:PCLinuxOS]] [[nl:PCLinuxOS]] [[ja:PCLinuxOS]] [[no:PCLinuxOS]] [[pl:PCLinuxOS]] [[pt:PCLinuxOS]] [[ro:PCLinuxOS]] [[ru:PCLinuxOS]] [[simple:PCLinuxOS]] [[sk:PCLinuxOS]] [[fi:PCLinuxOS]] [[sv:PCLinuxOS]] [[tr:PCLinuxOS]] [[uk:PCLinuxOS]] [[zh:PCLinuxOS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28034</id> <title>PC GAMESS</title> <text>'''PC GAMESS/Firefly''' is an [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] [[computational chemistry]] program for [[Intel]]-compatible [[x86]], [[x86-64]] [[Microprocessor|processor]]s based on [[GAMESS (US)]] sources. However, it has mostly been rewritten (about 60-70% of the code), especially in platform-specific parts ([[memory allocation]], disk [[Output|input-output]], [[computer network|network]]), [[mathematic]] functions (e.g., [[matrix operation]]s), and [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemical]] methods (such as [[Hartree&ndash;Fock]], [[Møller&ndash;Plesset perturbation theory]], and [[density functional theory]]). Therefore, it is significantly faster than the original GAMESS. The main maintainer of the program is Alex Granovsky. From October 2008, the project is dissociated from GAMESS (US) and the Firefly name was added. Up to October 17, 2009, both names will be used but thereafter the package will be known solely as Firefly.<ref>[http://classic.chem.msu.su/gran/gamess/ PC GAMESS Home Page]</ref> The [http://classic.chem.msu.su/gran/gamess/ Firefly website] now includes the following notice for users of pre-Firefly versions of PC GAMESS: As of December 4, 2009, the support of any PC GAMESS versions earlier than the first PC GAMESS/Firefly version 7.1.C is being abandoned. Therefore, users of the outdated PC GAMESS binaries (version 7.1.B and all earlier releases) are required to discontinue their use of the PC GAMESS and upgrade to Firefly. ==See also== *[[GAMESS (US)]] *[[GAMESS (UK)]] *[[Quantum chemistry computer programs]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.kressworks.com/Research/Quantum_Chemistry/pcgamess%20vs%20g98w.htm PC-GAMESS vs G98W MP4SDTQ Performance Comparison] * [http://www.meteo.mcgill.ca/andrew/bench/ PC GAMESS SCF Benchmark] * [http://www.biomolecular-modeling.com/Ascalaph/Ascalaph_Quantum.html Ascalaph Quantum] graphic interface for PC GAMESS {{science-software-stub}} [[Category:Computational chemistry software]] [[it:PC GAMESS]] [[ru:PC GAMESS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28036</id> <title>PC Live!</title> <text>{{Infobox Magazine | title = PC Live! | image_file = | image_caption = | image_size = 200px | company = [[Mediateam]] | total_circulation = 6,336 | frequency = Monthly | language = [[English language|English]] | category = [[Digital Lifestyle Magazines]] | editor = Niall Kitson | firstdate = 1994 | issn = 1393-0591 | country = {{flagcountry|Ireland}} | website = [http://www.pclive.ie pclive.ie] }} ''''''PC Live!'''''' is a [[digital lifestyle magazine]] from the [[Republic of Ireland]] edited and produced by the publishing company [http://www.mediateam.ie Mediateam] <ref>[http://www.mediateam.ie Mediateam]</ref> in [[Dublin]].
