that mailing lists automatically deliver new messages to the subscriber, while forums require the member to visit the website and check for new posts. Because members may miss replies in threads they are interested in, many modern forums offer an "e-mail notification" feature, whereby members can choose to be notified of new posts in a thread, and [[web feed]]s that allow members to see a summary of the new posts using [[feed aggregator|aggregator]] software. The main difference between newsgroups and forums is that additional software, a [[News client|newsreader]], is required to participate in newsgroups. Visiting and participating in forums normally requires no additional software beyond the [[web browser]]. [[Wiki]]s, unlike conventional forums, typically allow all users to edit all content, including each other's messages. This level of content manipulation is reserved for moderators or administrators on most forums. Wikis also allow the creation of other content outside the [[talk page]]s. On the other hand, [[weblogs]] and generic content management systems tend to be locked down to the point where only a few select users can post blog entries, although many allow other users to comment upon them. Forums differ from [[chat room]]s and [[instant messaging]] in that forum participants do not have to be online simultaneously to receive or send messages. Messages posted to a forum or Usenet are publicly available for some time, which is uncommon in chat rooms that maintain frequent activity. One rarity among forums is the ability to create your own picture album. Forum participants can upload personal pictures onto the site, add descriptions to the pictures, and choose album covers. Pictures are in the same format as posting threads, and contain the same options such as "Report Post" and "Reply to Post". ==See also== {{Portal|Internet}} *[[List of internet forums]] * [[Bulletin board system]] * [[Imageboard]] * [[Chat room]] * [[Internet social network]] * [[Virtual community]] * [[Comparison of Internet forum software]] * [[List of Internet phenomena]] *[[Warnock's Dilemma]] ==Notes== <references group="note"/> ==Examples== <references group="example"/> ==References== {{Reflist|2}} {{Computer-mediated communication}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Internet Forum}} [[Category:Groupware]] [[Category:Internet forums| ]] [[Category:On-line chat]] [[Category:Social information processing]] [[ar:منتدى إنترنت]] [[be:Вэб-форум]] [[bg:Интернет форум]] [[ca:Fòrum (Internet)]] [[cs:Internetová diskuse]] [[de:Internetforum]] [[es:Foro (Internet)]] [[eo:Retforumo]] [[fa:تالار گفتگو]] [[fr:Forum (informatique)]] [[ko:인터넷 포럼]] [[hy:Վեբ-ֆորում]] [[hr:Internetski forum]] [[id:Forum internet]] [[it:Forum (Internet)]] [[he:פורום (אינטרנט)]] [[la:Forum interretiale]] [[lb:Internetforum]] [[lt:Internetinis forumas]] [[hu:Fórumrendszer]] [[mk:Интернет-форум]] [[nl:Internetforum]] [[ja:インターネットコミュニティ]] [[no:Diskusjonsforum]] [[pl:Forum dyskusyjne]] [[pt:Fórum de discussão]] [[ru:Веб-форум]] [[simple:Forum]] [[sr:Форум (интернет)]] [[sh:Internet forum]] [[fi:Keskustelupalsta]] [[sv:Internetforum]] [[ta:இணைய மன்றம்]] [[th:เว็บบอร์ด]] [[tr:İnternet forumu]] [[uk:Веб-форум]] [[ur:جالبینی چوپال]] [[vi:Diễn đàn trực tuyến]] [[wa:Forom éndjolike]] [[yi:אינטערנעט פארום]] [[zh-yue:互聯網論壇]] [[zh:网络论坛]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19153</id> <title>Internet relationship</title> <text>'''Internet relationships''' are [[interpersonal relationship]]s, including [[intimate relationship]]s, between people who have met [[online]], and in many cases know each other only via the [[Internet]]. Online relationships are similar in many ways to [[pen pal]] relationships. In the late 20th century, it became easier for people to establish meaningful online [[personal relationship|relationship]]s. Since the development of high-speed [[Broadband internet access|broadband Internet]], online friendships have changed significantly. It is possible to hold real-time audio and video conversations over the Internet (creating [[telepresence]]), providing levels of interactivity beyond [[plain text]]. Psychologists in at least one study found that Internet dating can be successful.<ref>{{cite news|title= Internet Dating Much More Successful Than Thought|date=February 23, 2005|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=January 2, 2010|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/02/050218125144.htm}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * Dwyer, Diana (2000) Interpersonal Relationships (Routledge Modular Psychology) * Englehardt, E.E.

Probably one of the most common words that has an Internet spelling is the word referrer, which was misspelled in the [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/draft-ietf-http-spec.html HTTP 1.0 specification] and has caught on as a spelling of the word as a result. The Internet spelling of a word does not necessarily mean that every instance of its use on the Internet is in the Internet Spelling, it just means that the spelling of the word came into being in an Internet context. The differences between original spellings and Internet spellings are comparable to those between [[American and British English spelling differences|American Spellings and British spellings]]. == List of words with an Internet spelling == * [[HTTP referrer|referer]] (English: referrer) == See also == * [[Spelling]] * [[Spelling reform]] [[Category:English spelling]] [[Category:Internet culture]] [[Category:Writing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19159</id> <title>Internet traffic engineering</title> <text>'''[[Internet]] [[traffic engineering]]''' refers to all the work related to the physical [[telecommunications network|network]] (usually optical cables, [[routers]], exchanges) that carries [[Internet]] traffic between different networks with the objective of reaching the highest levels of capacity in the Internet backbone. ==References== Abdel-Hameed Nawar, "E-Commerce" Lecture Notes, Cairo University, Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Egypt, 2005. et al.

The IPX/SPX protocol stack is supported by [[Novell, Inc.|Novell]]'s [[NetWare]] [[network operating system]]. Because of Netware's popularity through the late 1980s into the mid 1990s, IPX became a popular [[internetworking]] protocol. Novell derived IPX from [[Xerox Network Systems]]' IDP protocol. IPX usage is in general decrease as the boom of the [[Internet]] has made [[TCP/IP]] nearly universal. Computers and networks can run multiple [[network protocol]]s, so almost all IPX sites will be running TCP/IP as well to allow for Internet connectivity.<ref>[http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5026038.html TechRepublic - Do you still support IPX/SPX on your Windows servers?]</ref> It is also now possible to run Novell products without IPX, as they have supported both IPX and TCP/IP since NetWare reached
