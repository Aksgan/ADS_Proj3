already through its memory). Gradually the system becomes "adapted" to its environment - that is it can confront the perturbations so as to survive. The resulting [[complexity]] of [[living system]]s is cognition produced by the history of bilateral perturbations within the system/environment schema. This theory contributes to the [[philosophical]] discussion of [[awareness]], [[consciousness]], [[cognition]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. ==See also== * [[Awareness]] * [[Cognition]] * [[Consciousness]] * [[Cognitive science]] * [[Complex systems]] * [[Fritjof Capra]] * [[Heinz von Foerster]] * [[Molecular Cellular Cognition]] * [[Systems thinking]] * [[Sustainability]] * [[Portal:thinking]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External resources== *Capra, Fritjof The Santiago Theory of Cognition.

An example of one such device is [[SPOT_Satellite_Messenger|SPOT]]. The devices use an internal [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] chip to gather location information. When the SEND is triggered this information is sent via commercial satellite to a commercial monitoring agency whose role is to pass the information to an appropriate responding agency. The responding agency contacted depends, in part, on the location. Examples of responding agencies would be military Search and Rescue, Coast Guard, local police, voluntary Search and Rescue. Typical users/purchasers of these devices are outdoor enthusiasts (hikers, mountain bikers, climbers, boaters, sailors) and pilots. They are also useful for those who work alone in remote areas (loggers, foresters, geologists, fisheries and wildlife staff). Additional features are increasingly being offered: sending preprogrammed message, breadcrumb tracking via [[Google Earth]]. Some newer devices offer two-way communication via satellite. [example needed??] One of the primary considerations when buying one of these is ensuring that the commercial monitoring agency which receives a distress call maintains an accurate and up-to-date database of response agencies to contact and can quickly determine which is appropriate to the situation/location. The potential for long delays or no response at all is very real if this is not in place. Since monitoring agencies consider their databases proprietary, there is no obvious way for a purchaser to determine if it is accurate or up-to-date. The [[USCG|US Coast Guard]]'s National Search and Rescue Committee (NSARC) has set up a working group which includes representation from other US agencies, international organizations and device manufacturers to discuss how these "technologies can be properly reviewed and integrated with the SAR response system in the United States"<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/nsarc/NSARC_SEND_minutes_Dec09.pdf] NSARC minutes from December 2009</ref> and to aid the [[RTCM|Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM)]] in "development of a minimum operating and performance specification for such devices"<ref>[http://www.icao.int/icaoimojwg/meetings/jwg16/docs/JWGSAR16_wp09.pdf] Emerging technologies in commercially available alerting devices from [[International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|ICAO]]/[[International_Maritime_Organization|IMO]] JOINT WORKING GROUP, October 2009</ref>. ==See also== * [[Distress radiobeacon]] which covers PLB, ELT, EPIRB ==References== <references/> ==External links== [[Category:Technology stubs]] [[Category:Hiking equipment]] [[Category:Emergency communication]] [[Category:Beacons]] [[Category:Rescue equipment]] [[Category:Survival skills]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33208</id> <title>Satisfiability Modulo Theories</title> <text>In [[computer science]], the '''Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem''' is a [[decision problem]] for logical formulas with respect to combinations of background [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theories]] expressed in classical [[first-order logic]] with equality. Examples of theories typically used in computer science are the theory of [[real numbers]], the theory of [[integers]], and the theories of various [[data structure]]s such as [[List (computing)|list]]s, [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[bit vector]]s and so on. ==Basic terminology== Formally speaking, an SMT instance is a [[formula]] in [[first-order logic]], where some function and predicate symbols have additional interpretations, and SMT is the problem of determining whether such a formula is satisfiable. In other words, imagine an instance of the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] (SAT) in which some of the binary variables are replaced by [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s over a suitable set of non-binary variables. A predicate is basically a binary-valued function of non-binary variables. Example predicates include linear [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] (e.g., <math>3x+ 2y - z \geq 4</math>) or equalities involving so-called uninterpreted terms and function symbols (e.g., <math>f(f(u, v), v) = f(u, v)</math> where <math>f</math> is some unspecified function of two unspecified arguments.) These predicates are classified according to the theory they belong to. For instance, linear inequalities over real variables are evaluated using the rules of the theory of linear real [[arithmetic]], whereas predicates involving uninterpreted terms and function symbols are evaluated using the rules of the theory of [[uninterpreted function]]s with equality (sometimes referred to as the empty theory <ref>http://www.csl.sri.com/users/demoura/smt-comp/introduction.shtml</ref>). Other theories include the theories of [[array data structure|arrays]] and [[List (computing)|list]] structures (useful for modeling and verifying [[software program]]s), and the theory of [[bit vectors]] (useful in modeling and verifying [[hardware design]]s). Subtheories are also possible: for example, difference logic is a sub-theory of linear arithmetic in which each inequality is restricted to have the form <math>x - y \leq c</math> for variables <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> and constant <math>c</math>. Most SMT solvers support only quantifier free fragments of their logics. ==Expressive power of SMT== An SMT instance is a generalization of a [[Boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean SAT]] instance in which various sets of variables are replaced by [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s from a variety of underlying theories. Obviously, SMT formulas provide a much richer modeling [[language]] than is possible with Boolean SAT formulas. For example, an SMT formula allows us to model the [[datapath]] operations of a [[microprocessor]] at the word rather than the bit level. ==SMT solvers== Early attempts for solving SMT instances involved translating them to Boolean SAT instances (e.g., a 32-bit integer variable would be encoded by 32 bit variables with appropriate weights and word-level operations such as 'plus' would be replaced by lower-level logic operations on the bits) and passing this formula to a Boolean SAT solver. This approach, which is referred to as ''the eager approach'', has its merits: by pre-processing the SMT formula into an equivalent Boolean SAT formula we can use existing Boolean SAT solvers "as-is" and leverage their performance and capacity improvements over time. On the other hand, the
