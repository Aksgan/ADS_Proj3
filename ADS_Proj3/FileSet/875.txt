of fraud may be facilitated using computer systems, including [[bank fraud]], [[identity theft]], [[extortion]], and [[Classified information|theft of classified information]]. A variety of [[Internet fraud|Internet scams]] target consumers direct. ===Obscene or offensive content=== The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful, [[obscene]] or offensive for a variety of reasons. In some instances these communications may be illegal. Many{{Quantify|date=February 2010}} jurisdictions place limits on certain [[freedom of speech|speech]] and ban [[racist]], [[blasphemy|blasphemous]], politically subversive, [[libel]]ous or [[slander]]ous, [[seditious]], or inflammatory material that tends to incite [[hate crimes]]. The extent to which these communications are unlawful varies greatly between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs. One area of [[Internet pornography]] that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is [[child pornography]]. ===Harassment=== Whereas content may be offensive in a non-specific way, [[harassment]] directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing for example on gender, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties (see [[cyber bullying]], [[cyber stalking]], [[harassment by computer]], [[hate crime]], [[Online predator]], and [[stalking]]). Any comment that may be found derogatory or offensive is considered harassment. ===Drug trafficking=== Drug traffickers are increasingly taking advantage of the Internet to sell their illegal substances through encrypted [[e-mail]] and other Internet Technology.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Some [[drug trafficker]]s arrange deals at [[internet cafe]]s, use courier Web sites to track illegal packages of pills, and swap recipes for amphetamines in restricted-access chat rooms. The rise in Internet drug trades could also be attributed to the lack of face-to-face communication. These virtual exchanges allow more intimidated individuals to more comfortably purchase illegal drugs. The sketchy effects that are often associated with drug trades are severely minimized and the filtering process that comes with physical interaction fades away. ===Cyberterrorism=== Government officials and [[Information Technology]] security specialists have documented a significant increase in Internet problems and server scans since early 2001. But there is a growing concern among federal officials {{Who|date=October 2007}} that such intrusions are part of an organized effort by [[cyberterrorist]]s, foreign intelligence services, or other groups to map potential security holes in critical systems. A cyberterrorist is someone who intimidates or coerces a government or organization to advance his or her political or social objectives by launching computer-based attack against computers, network, and the information stored on them. Cyberterrorism in general, can be defined as an act of terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources (Parker 1983). As such, a simple propaganda in the Internet, that there will be bomb attacks during the holidays can be considered cyberterrorism. As well there are also hacking activities directed towards individuals, families, organized by groups within networks, tending to cause fear among people, demonstrate power, collecting information relevant for ruining peoples' lives, robberies, blackmailing etc. ===Cyber warfare=== {{Main|Cyber warfare}} The U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) notes that cyberspace has emerged as a national-level concern through several recent events of geo-strategic significance. Among those are included the attack on [[Estonia]]'s infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by Russian hackers. "In August 2008, Russia again allegedly conducted cyber attacks, this time in a coordinated and synchronized kinetic and non-kinetic campaign against the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Fearing that such attacks may become the norm in future warfare among nation-states, the concept of cyberspace operations impacts and will be adapted by warfighting military commanders in the future.<ref>[http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/War%20is%20War%20Issue%20Paper%20Final2.pdf "War is War?

The original motivation of the hackers was to watch Star Trek re-runs in Germany; which was something which Newscorp did not have the copyright to allow.<ref>Mann, D. and Sutton, M. (1998) >>Netcrime: More Change in the Organization of Thieving. British Journal of Criminology. 38:PP. 201-229 [http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/201 Oxfordjournals.org]</ref> * The [[Yahoo!]] website was attacked at 10:30 PST on Monday, 7 February 2000. The attack, started by [[MafiaBoy]], lasted for three hours. Yahoo was pinged at the rate of one [[gigabyte]]/second. * On 3 August 2000, Canadian federal prosecutors charged [[MafiaBoy]] with 54 counts of illegal access to computers, plus a total of ten counts of mischief to data for his attacks on [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], [[Dell Computer]], Outlaw.net, and Yahoo. MafiaBoy had also attacked other websites, but prosecutors decided that a total of 66 counts was enough. MafiaBoy pleaded not guilty. * About fifty computers at [[Stanford University]], and also computers at the University of California at Santa Barbara, were amongst the [[zombie computer]]s sending pings in [[DDoS]] attacks. *On 2 March 2010, Spanish investigators busted 3 in infection of over 13 million computers around the world. The "botnet" of infected computers included PCs inside more than half of the [[Fortune 1000]] companies and more than 40 major banks, according to investigators. * In 26 March 1999, the [[Melissa (computer worm)|Melissa worm]] infected a document on a victim's computer, then automatically sent that document and copy of the virus via e-mail to other people. * [[Russian Business Network]] (RBN) was registered as an internet site in 2006. Initially, much of its activity was legitimate. But apparently the founders soon discovered that it was more profitable to host illegitimate activities and started hiring its services to criminals. The RBN has been described by [[VeriSign]] as "the baddest of the bad". It offers web hosting services and internet access to all kinds of criminal and objectionable activities, with a individual activities earning up to $150 million in one year. It specialized in and in some cases monopolized [[Personally identifiable information|personal identity theft]] for resale. It is the originator of [[MPack (software)|MPack]] and an alleged operator of
