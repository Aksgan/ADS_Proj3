motor, dispensing the next label until the sensor once again detects the label which opens the circuit. The first electric dispenser was designed with the limit switch on the left of a 16" wide machine. 4-up multiple-row labels were loaded into the machine and once activated would advance one row of labels. The operator would take the labels from right to left, so that when the leftmost label was taken, the next row advanced, automatically providing a constant supply of labels to apply. The labels are also peeled without the natural curl that will happen when pulled from the backing paper with fingers. Also, only one hand was needed to take the label, the other hand could be used to move the material the label was being applied to. Semi-automatic label dispensers are often built to withstand industrial conditions. ===Components=== * [[electric motor|Motor]]: The motor automates the label dispenser and controls the speed at which labels are dispensed. * Feed-Roller: This actually is the first patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal roller and a rubber roller. The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes. The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the rubber roller (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material to the side of the machine with the sensor. Using this method label stock up to 16" width can be advanced and tracked perfectly. The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle. * Take-up hub/spool: This can take the place of the feed-roller. The take-up hub consists of a bar and a liner holder/clip, which are connected to the motor on a single side-frame. In operation, they turn in sync with the motor and wind the label liner in order to collect it in one place. As the take-up hub turns, pressure is placed in the liner and it is stretched across the strip plate, where peeling, or separation, occurs. * Strip plate: A component of the machine which acts as a separator for the label and its liner. Each label is pulled across the strip plate until it is recognized by a photo sensor or limit switch. Strip plates can be of varying design and material, but they are often made of plastic, metal coil, or aluminum. * [[Photodetector]] or [[Limit switch]]: Used to trigger label advancement. Every semi-automatic label dispenser is equipped with one or the other. These detect the absence or presence of a label to facilitate dispensing. * [[Limit switch]]: This is the original method of label detection and can be used for most applications, it can detect a wide variety of labels. * [[Photodetector]]/Electric eye: Is an alternate method which uses a beam of light broken by the label as it passes over/between the sensors. It can be used for many different label types, but transparent material is an issue. ==Examples of dispensers and applicators== <gallery> Image:4051 lpa.jpg|Label applicator applying a [[label]] to adjacent panels of a [[corrugated fiberboard]] [[box]] File:label dispenser.jpg| Semi-automatic dispenser Image:Print n apply ucc.jpg|"Print & Apply" corner wrap label application to a [[pallet]] load </gallery> {{DEFAULTSORT:Label Dispenser}} [[Category:Packaging machinery]] [[Category:Electro mechanical engineering]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21049</id> <title>Labeled Security Protection Profile</title> <text>'''Labeled Security Protection Profile''' (LSPP) is a [[protection profile]] within the [[common criteria|Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation]], a set of security functional and assurance requirements for IT products. The LSPP requirements are derived from the ''B1'' class of the [[United States|US]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] security standard called [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC) which was originally published in 1985. For example, [[z/OS]] V1.7 was certified [[Evaluation Assurance Level|EAL]]4+ for LSPP in 2006. == See also == * [[Common criteria]] * [http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/lspp.pdf LABELED SECURITY PROTECTION PROFILE] [[Category:Computer security procedures]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21055</id> <title>Laboratory information system</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=June 2007}} A '''lab information system''' ("LIS") is a class of [[software]] that receives, processes, and stores information generated by [[medical laboratory]] processes. These systems often must interface with [[Automated analyser|instruments]] and other information systems such as [[hospital information system]]s (HIS). A LIS is a highly configurable application which is customized to facilitate a wide variety of laboratory workflow models. Deciding on an LIS vendor is a major undertaking for all labs. Vendor selection typically takes months of research and planning. Installation takes from a few months to a few years depending on the complexity of the organization. There are as many variations of LISs as there are types of lab work. Some vendors offer a full-service solution capable of handling a large hospital lab's needs; others specialize in specific modules. Disciplines of laboratory science supported by LISs include [[hematology]], [[chemistry]], [[immunology]], blood bank (Donor and Transfusion Management), surgical [[pathology]], [[anatomical pathology]], [[flow cytometry]] and [[microbiology]]. This article covers clinical lab which encompasses hematology, chemistry and immunology. ==Basic operation== Laboratory Information Systems are often part of an integrated informatics solution which involves many disparate [[application software|applications]]. Use of an LIS is a critical piece of the clinical IT spectrum of systems and contributes significantly to the overall care given to patients. The LIS is used in inpatient and outpatient settings and in many cases is designed to support both. From an outpatient/ambulatory perspective, LIS interaction frequently begins after a [[physician]] has arrived at an initial [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. For example, a patient enters the hospital looking pale and complaining of [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]. The physician, suspecting [[anemia]], might decide to order a [[complete blood count]] (CBC). In an inpatient setting when that patient is admitted into the hospital, the system is used to order tests, provide specimen processing assistance, receive the results from analyzers and deliver lab reports to
