An example might be where water quality in a stream has been observed over many years and a test is made of the null hypothesis that there is no change in quality between the first and second halves of the data against the alternative hypothesis that the quality is poorer in the second half of the record. The concept of an alternative hypothesis in testing was devised by [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]], and it is used in the [[Neyman–Pearson lemma]]. It forms a major component in modern [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. However it was not part of [[Ronald Fisher|Ronald Fisher's]] formulation of statistical hypothesis testing, and he violently opposed its use.<ref name="Cohen">[[Jacob Cohen (statistician)|Cohen, J.]] 1990. Things I have learned (so far). American Psychologist 45: 1304&ndash;1312.</ref> In Fisher's approach to testing, the central idea is to assess whether the observed dataset could have resulted from chance if the null hypothesis were assumed to hold, notionally without preconceptions about what other model might hold. Modern statistical hypothesis testing accommodates this type of test since the alternative hypothesis can be just the negation of the null hypothesis. == References == {{reflist}} {{Statistics}} [[Category:Hypothesis testing]] [[Category:Statistical inference]] [[eo:Alternativa hipotezo]] [[ko:대립가설]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1601</id> <title>Alternative splicing and transcript diversity database</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=January 2011}} {{infobox biodatabase |title = ASTD |logo =[[File:Database.png]] |description = [[Alternative splicing|alternative Splicing]] and [[RNA|Transcript]] Diversity database. |scope = |organism = |center =[[European Bioinformatics Institute]] |laboratory = |author = Gautier Koscielny |pmid = Koscielny & al.
