The operator is called a ''jump operator'' because it increases the [[Turing degree]] of the problem ''X''. That is, the problem ''X''&prime; is not [[Turing reducible]] to ''X''. [[Post's theorem]] establishes a relationship between the Turing jump operator and the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] of sets of natural numbers. Informally, given a problems, the Turing jump returns gives the set of Turing machines which halt when given access to an oracle that solves that problem. == Definition == Given a set ''X'' and a [[Gödel numbering]] <math>\varphi_i^X</math> of the [[relative computability|''X''-computable]] functions, the '''Turing jump''' ''X''&prime; of ''X'' is defined as :<math>X'= \{x \mid \varphi_x^X(x) \ \mbox{is defined} \}.</math> The '''''n''th Turing jump''' ''X''<sup>(''n'')</sup> is defined inductively by :<math>X^{(0)} = X, \,</math> :<math>X^{(n+1)}=(X^{(n)})'. \,</math> The '''&omega; jump''' ''X''<sup>(&omega;)</sup> of ''X'' is the [[effective join]] of the sequence of sets <math>\langle X^{(n)}\mid n \in \mathbb{N}\rangle</math>: :<math>X^{(\omega)} = \{p_i^k \mid k \in X^{(i)}\},\,</math> where <math>p_i</math> denotes the ''i''th prime. The notation 0&prime; is often used for the Turing jump of the empty set. It is read ''zero-jump'' or sometimes ''zero-prime''. Similarly, 0<sup>(''n'')</sup> is the ''n''th jump of the empty set. For finite ''n'', these sets are closely related to the [[arithmetic hierarchy]]. The jump can be iterated into transfinite ordinals: the sets 0<sup>(&alpha;)</sup> for &alpha;<&omega;<sub>1</sub><sup>CK</sup> (where &omega;<sub>1</sub><sup>CK</sup> is the [[Church-Kleene ordinal]]) are closely related to the [[hyperarithmetic hierarchy]]. Beyond &omega;<sub>1</sub><sup>CK</sup>, the process can be continued through the countable ordinals of the [[constructible universe]], using set-theoretic methods (Hodes 1980). == Examples == * The Turing jump <math>\emptyset'</math> of the empty set is Turing equivalent to the [[halting problem]]. * For each ''n'', the set <math>\emptyset^{(n)}</math> is [[m-complete]] at level <math>\Sigma^0_n</math> in the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]. * The set of Gödel numbers of true formulas in the language of [[Peano arithmetic]] with a predicate for ''X'' is computable from <math>X^{(\omega)}</math>. == Properties == * ''X''&prime; is ''X''-[[computably enumerable]] but not ''X''-[[computable function|computable]]. * If ''A'' is [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] to ''B'' then ''A''&prime; is Turing equivalent to ''B''&prime;. The converse of this implication is not true. * ([[Richard Shore|Shore]] and [[Theodore Slaman|Slaman]], 1999) The function mapping ''X'' to ''X''&prime; is definable in the partial order of the Turing degrees. Many properties of the Turing jump operator are discussed in the article on [[Turing degree]]s. == References == Ambos-Spies, K. and Fejer, P. Degrees of Unsolvability.

A human judge engages in a natural language [[conversation]] with one [[human]] and one machine, each of which tries to appear human. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. In order to test the machine's intelligence rather than its ability to render words into audio, the conversation is limited to a text-only channel such as a [[keyboard (computing)|computer keyboard]] and [[visual display unit|screen]].<ref>Turing originally suggested a [[teleprinter]], one of the few text-only communication systems available in 1950. {{Harv|Turing|1950|p=433}}</ref> The test was introduced by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1950 paper ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]'', which opens with the words: "I propose to consider
