between the outside and inside of the "rainscreen" prevents water penetration into the building itself. For example the glass is captured between an inner and an outer gasket in a space called the glazing rebate. The glazing rebate is ventilated to the exterior so that the pressure on the inner and outer sides of the exterior gasket is the same. When the pressure is equal across this gasket water cannot be drawn through joints or defects in the gasket. ==Design== Curtain wall systems must be designed to handle all loads imposed on it as well as keep air and water from penetrating the building envelope. ===Loads=== The loads imposed on the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure through the anchors which attach the mullions to the building. The building structure design must account for these loads. ;Dead load ''Dead load'' is defined as the weight of structural elements and the permanent features on the structure. In the case of curtain walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of the curtain wall, as well as the weight of the infill material. Additional dead loads imposed on the curtain wall, such as sunshades, must be accounted for in the design of the curtain wall components and anchors. ;Wind load ''Wind load'' acting on the building is the result of wind blowing on the building. This [[wind]] [[pressure]] must be resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building. Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in [[hurricane]]-prone regions. For each project location, [[building code]]s specify the required design wind loads. Often, a [[wind tunnel]] study is performed on large or unusually shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account [[vortex shedding]] around corners and the effects of surrounding area ;Seismic load ''Seismic loads'' need to be addressed in the design of curtain wall components and anchors. In most situations, the curtain wall is able to naturally withstand [[seismology|seismic]] and wind induced building sway because of the space provided between the glazing infill and the mullion. In tests, standard curtain wall systems are able to withstand three inches (75 mm) of relative floor movement without glass breakage or water leakage. Anchor design needs to be reviewed, however, since a large floor-to-floor displacement can place high forces on anchors. (Additional structure must be provided within the primary structure of the building to resist seismic forces from the building itself.) ;Snow load ''Snow loads'' and [[dead and live loads|live loads]] are not typically an issue in curtain walls, since curtain walls are designed to be vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered. ;Thermal load ''Thermal loads'' are induced in a curtain wall system because [[aluminum]] has a relatively high [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. This means that over the span of a couple of floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions. In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by wiper [[gaskets]]. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement. Incidentally, this slot also accounts for live load deflection and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] in the floor slabs of the building structure. ;Blast load Accidental explosions and terrorist threats have brought on increased concern for the fragility of a curtain wall system in relation to blast loads. The bombing of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], has spawned much of the current research and mandates in regards to building response to blast loads. Currently, all new federal buildings in the U.S. and all U.S. embassies built on foreign soil, must have some provision for resistance to bomb blasts. Since the curtain wall is at the exterior of the building, it becomes the first line of defense in a bomb attack. As such, blast resistant curtain walls must be designed to withstand such forces without compromising the interior of the building to protect its occupants. Since blast loads are very high loads with short durations, the curtain wall response should be analyzed in a [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] load analysis, with full-scale [[mock-up]] testing performed prior to design completion and installation. Blast resistant glazing consists of [[laminated glass]], which is meant to break but not separate from the mullions. Similar technology is used in [[hurricane]]-prone areas for the protection from wind-borne debris. ===Infiltration=== ''Air infiltration'' is the air which passes through the curtain wall from the exterior to the interior of the building. The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical [[mullions]], through [[weep hole]]s, and through imperfect sealing. The American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall . This limit is expressed (in America) in cubic feet per minute per square foot of wall area at a given test pressure. (Currently, most standards cite less than 0.6 CFM/sq ft as acceptable.) Testing is typically conducted by an independent third party agency using the ASTM E-783 standard. ''Water penetration'' is defined as any water passing from the exterior of the building through to the interior of the curtain wall system. Sometimes, depending on the building [[specifications]], a small amount of controlled water on the interior is deemed acceptable. AAMA Voluntary Specifications allow for water on the interior, while the underlying ASTM E - 1105 test standard would disqualify a test subject
