in the software community concerning the legal status of the JPEG 2000 standard. JPEG 2000 is included in most [[Linux distribution]]s. ==Related standards== Several additional parts of the JPEG 2000 standard exist; Amongst them are ISO/IEC 15444-2:2000, JPEG 2000 extensions defining the '''.jpx''' file format, featuring for example [[Trellis quantization]], an extended file format and additional [[color space]]s<ref name="ISO-15444-2">{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33160 | author = International Organization for Standardization | title = ISO/IEC 15444-2:2004, Information technology -- JPEG 2000 image coding system: Extensions | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2009-06-11 }}</ref>, ISO/IEC 15444-4:2000, the reference testing and ISO/IEC 15444-6:2000, the compound image file format ('''.jpm'''), allowing compression of compound text/image graphics.<ref name="ISO-15444-6">{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=35458 | author = International Organization for Standardization | title = ISO/IEC 15444-6:2003, Information technology -- JPEG 2000 image coding system -- Part 6: Compound image file format | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2009-06-11 }}</ref> Extensions for secure image transfer, ''JPSEC'' (ISO/IEC 15444-8), enhanced error-correction schemes for wireless applications, ''JPWL'' (ISO/IEC 15444-11) and extensions for encoding of volumetric images, ''JP3D'' (ISO/IEC 15444-10) are also already available from the ISO. ===JPIP protocol for streaming JPEG 2000 images=== In 2005, a JPEG 2000 based image browsing protocol, called [[JPIP]] has been published as ISO/IEC 15444-9.<ref name="ISO-15444-9">{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39413 | author = International Organization for Standardization | title = ISO/IEC 15444-9:2005, Information technology -- JPEG 2000 image coding system: Interactivity tools, APIs and protocols | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2009-06-11 }}</ref> Within this framework, only selected regions of potentially huge images have to be transmitted from an image server on the request of a client, thus reducing the required bandwidth. ===Motion JPEG 2000=== Motion JPEG 2000 is defined in ISO/IEC 15444-3 and in ITU-T T.802<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.802/en | title=T.802 : Information technology - JPEG 2000 image coding system: Motion JPEG 2000 | date=2005-01 | accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>.

Filename extensions for Motion JPEG 2000 video files are '''.mj2''' and '''.mjp2''' according to RFC 3745. Motion JPEG 2000 (often referenced as MJ2 or MJP2) also is under consideration as a digital archival format by the [[Library of Congress]]. It is an open [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard and an advanced update to [[MJPEG]] (or MJ), which was based on the legacy [[JPEG]] format. Unlike common video formats, such as [[MPEG-4 Part 2]], [[WMV]], and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], MJ2 does not employ temporal or inter-frame compression. Instead, each frame is an independent entity encoded by either a lossy or lossless variant of JPEG 2000. Its physical structure does not depend on time ordering, but it does employ a separate profile to complement the data. For audio, it supports [[LPCM]] encoding, as well as various MPEG-4 variants, as "raw" or complement data.<ref>[http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/j2kpart3.html Motion JPEG 2000 (Part 3)]</ref><ref>[http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000127.shtml Motion JPEG 2000 mj2 File Format].
