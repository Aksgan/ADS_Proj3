The Language is based on a [[Visual_Basic|Visual Basic]]-like syntax, with support for objects and with a GUI designer. Basic4android code compiles to native [[Dalvik_(software)|Dalvik]] bytecode using [[Android (operating system)#Software development kit|Android SDK]]. ==History (major versions)== Version 1.0 of Basic4android was released on December, 2010. ==Language and IDE features== '''Syntax''': The syntax is similar to [[Visual Basic]] and [[Visual Basic .NET]]. '''GUI Designer''': The GUI designer is made of two components. The first component is the control panel and it is part of the IDE. The second component runs on the connected device or [[emulator]], and is the visual component. Both components communicate using [[TCP/IP]] communication. The layout can be either changed in the control panel or directly in the visual component, by moving the views. The layout is saved in a special layout file. This file can include several layout variants that match different screens and resolutions. '''External Libraries''': New functionality is added by writing Java libraries. A customized [[Doclets|Doclet]] is used to create an [[XML]] file that describes the library for the IDE. ==Example code== Here is an example of the language: Code snippet that displays a message box "Hello World!" as the application starts: <source lang="vb"> Sub Activity_Create(FirstTime As Boolean) Msgbox("Hello world!", "") End Sub </source> ==External links== * [http://www.Basic4ppc.com Basic4android homepage] {{Android}} [[Category:Integrated development environments]] [[Category:Android development software]] [[Category:BASIC programming language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3432</id> <title>Basing diagram</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=February 2009}} A '''basing diagram''' shows or describes the “pins” of an [[electronic component]]. This part usually has more than two pins, so a basing diagram is needed to show which pin does what. Many basing diagrams also show [[dimension]]s. {{DEFAULTSORT:Basing Diagram}} [[Category:Electronic engineering]] [[Category:Diagrams]] {{Electronics-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>3436</id> <title>Basis pursuit denoising</title> <text>'''Basis pursuit denoising''' is the [[mathematical optimization]] problem of the form: :<math>\min_x \frac{1}{2}\|y-Ax\|^2_2+\lambda\|x\|_1.</math> where <math>\lambda</math> is a parameter that controls the trade-off between sparsity and reconstruction fidelity, <math>x</math> is a <math>N \times 1</math> solution vector, <math>y</math> is a <math>M \times 1</math> vector of observations, <math>A</math> is a <math>M \times N</math> transform matrix and <math>M < N</math>. Basis pursuit denoising solves a [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] problem with a trade-off between having a small residual (making <math>y</math> close to <math>Ax</math> in the <math>L_2</math> sense) and making <math>x</math> simple in the <math>L_1</math> sense. Exact solutions to basis pursuit denoising are often the best computationally tractable approximation of an underdetermined system of equations. Basis pursuit denoising thus has potential applications in statistics (c.f. the [[Lasso_(statistics)#LASSO_method|LASSO]] method of [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]]), [[image compression]] and [[Compressed sensing]]. When <math>\lambda=0</math>, this problem becomes [[basis pursuit]]. ==Solving basis pursuit denoising== Several popular methods for solving basis pursuit denoising include [[homotopy continuation]], [[fixed-point continuation]] and [[spectral projected gradient for L1 minimization]] (which actually solves [[Lasso_(statistics)#LASSO_method|LASSO]], a related problem).

A. (2007). Social Psychology 6th Edition. New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.</ref> One of the most influential studies of this phenomenon was done by [[Robert Cialdini]] in 1976, in which it was demonstrated that the [[undergraduate]] students of six different universities were more likely to wear their university affiliated apparel the Monday morning after a victorious football weekend and that they were more likely to use the pronoun "we" after a successful athletic weekend than if their team had lost. The students sought to have the success of the team linked to them by wearing school-identified apparel.<ref>Cialdini, R. B., Borden, R. J., Thorne, A., Walker, M., Freeman, S., & Sloan, L. (1976). “Basking in reflected glory: Three (football) field studies.” ‘‘Journal of Personality and Social Psychology’’, 34, 366-375.</ref> The term used for the behavior exhibited by supporters of the losing team is '''cutting off reflected failure'''. ==Roots of BIRGing== BIRGing is rooted in [[social identity theory]], which explains how [[self-esteem]] and self-evaluation can be enhanced by the identification with another person’s success by basking in reflected glory not earned. The social identity theory states that people are motivated to behave in ways that maintain and boost their self esteem. Having high self esteem is typically a perception of oneself as attractive, competent, likable and morally good person. These attributes make the person more attractive to the outside social world and making it more desirable for others to be in positive relationships with them. BIRGing is a widespread and important impression management technique to counter any threats to self esteem and maintain positive relations with others. ==Role of Deindividuation== Another equally important contributing influence is [[deindividuation]], a psychological state characterized by partial or complete loss of self-awareness, diffused responsibility, and decreased concern
