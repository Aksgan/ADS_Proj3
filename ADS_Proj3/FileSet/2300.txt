from the University of Wisconsin in 1950 and Ph.D from the University of Pennsylvania in 1959, having started his career in industry in 1951, working at the Bell Aircraft Corporation, RCA and the Auerbach Corporation. He joined the University of Maryland in 1967, becoming Professor of Computer Science in 1971 and the first Chairman of the Department in 1974. He became Professor Emeritus in 1998. Minker is one of the founders of the area of deductive databases and disjunctive logic programming. He has made important contributions to semantic [[query optimization]] and to cooperative and informative answers for deductive databases. He has also developed a theoretical basis for disjunctive databases and disjunctive logic programs, developing the [[Generalized Closed World Assumption]] (GCWA). Minker has over 150 refereed publications and has edited or co-edited five books on deductive databases, logic programming, and the use of logic in artificial intelligence. He is Founding Editor-in-Chief of the Theory and Practice of Logic Programming Journal. Minker was Vice-Chairman of the Committee of Concerned Scientists since 1973, and Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights (CSFHR) of the Association for Computing Machinery from 1980-1989. He led the struggle for the release of [[Natan Sharansky|Anatoly Shcharansky]] and [[Alexander Lerner]] from the late Soviet Union. He also campaigned on behalf of [[Andrei Sakharov]] and his wife, [[Yelena Bonner]]. ==Honours and awards== Minker was elected a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in 1989, founding Fellow of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) in 1990, Fellow of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) in 1991,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/membership/fellows/Alphabetical/mfellows.html#Mi | title=Fellows - M | work=IEEE Fellows | publisher=IEEE | year=1991 | accessdate=2010-01-23 | quote=for contributions to deductive databases, disjunctive logic programming, and artificial intelligence}}</ref> and founding Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) in 1994.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=1010784&srt=alpha&alpha=M | title=Jack Minker | work=ACM Fellows | publisher=ACM | year=1994 | accessdate=2010-01-23 | quote=For championing the rights of scientists to practice their profession freely and openly, for bringing to public attention the names of scientists deprived of their scientific freedom and human rights, and for giving these victims hope and making them aware of ACM's support.}}</ref> He received the ACM Outstanding Contribution Award for his work on human rights in 1985, the ACM Recognition of Service Award in 1989, the University of Maryland President's Medal for 1996, and the prestigious ACM Allen Newell Award for 2005. The Allen Newell Award is a recognition by the Association for Computing Machinery to individuals that have contributed to the breadth of knowledge within computer science and the bridging between computer science and other disciplines. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://prism.cs.umd.edu/people/minker.html Home page] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME =Minker, Jack | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH =[[Brooklyn, New York]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Minker, Jack}} [[Category:1927 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:People from Brooklyn]] [[Category:Brooklyn College alumni]] [[Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]] [[Category:Fellows of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] [[Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] [[Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Category:University of Maryland, College Park faculty]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19619</id> <title>Jack Steinberger</title> <text>{{Infobox scientist |name = Jack Steinberger |box_width = |image = Jack-Steinberger-2008.JPG |imagesize = 150px |caption = Jack Steinberger |birth_name = Hans Jakob Steinberger |birth_date = May 25, 1921 (age 89) |birth_place = [[Bad Kissingen]] |nationality = [[Germany]]-[[United States]]-[[Switzerland]] |ethnicity = |workplaces = [[University of California, Berkeley]] |field = [[Physics]] |known_for = Discovery of the [[muon neutrino]] |prizes = [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1988 }} '''Jack Steinberger''' (born May 25, 1921) is a [[Germany|German]]-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]] currently residing near [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. He co-discovered the [[muon neutrino]], along with [[Leon Lederman]] and [[Melvin Schwartz]], for which they were given the 1988 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. ==Life== Steinberger was born in the city of [[Bad Kissingen]] in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], in 1921. The rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party in Germany, with its open [[anti-Semitism]], prompted his parents to send him out of the country. Steinberger emigrated to the [[United States]] at the age of 13, making the trans-Atlantic trip with his brother Herbert. Barnett Farroll cared for him as a foster child, the connection was made by Jewish charities in the United States. During this period, Steinberger attended [[New Trier Township High School]], in [[Winnetka, Illinois]]. Steinberger studied chemical engineering at Armour Institute of Technology (now [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]) but left after his scholarship ended to help supplement his family's income. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the [[University of Chicago]], in 1942. Shortly thereafter, he joined the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] at [[MIT]]. With the help of the [[G.I. Bill]], he returned to graduate studies at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1946, where he studied under [[Edward Teller]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. His Ph.D. thesis concerned the energy spectrum of electrons emitted in [[muon]] [[particle decay|decay]]; his results showed that this was a three-body decay, and implied the participation of two neutral particle in the decay (later identified as the [[electron neutrino|electron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}) and [[muon neutrino|muon]] ({{SubatomicParticle|muon neutrino}}) neutrinos) rather than one. ==Early career== After receiving his doctorate, Steinberger attended the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] for a year. In 1949 he published a calculation of the lifetime of the neutral [[pion]],<ref> {{cite journal |author=J. Steinberger |year=1949 |title=On the use of subtraction fields and the lifetimes of some types of meson decay |url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=PHRVA,76,1180 |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=76 |pages=1180 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.1180 }}</ref> which anticipated the study of anomalies in quantum field theory. Following Princeton, Steinberger went to the [[Radiation Lab]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], where he performed an experiment which demonstrated the production of neutral pions and their decay to photon pairs. This experiment utilized the 330 MeV synchrotron and the newly-invented scintillation counters.<ref> {{cite journal |author=J. Steinberger, W. K. H.
