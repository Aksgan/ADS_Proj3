Although there is no absolute distinction between different areas of topology, the focus here is on [[general topology]]. The following definitions are also fundamental to [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]] and [[geometric topology]]. See the article on [[topological space]]s for basic definitions and examples, and see the article on [[topology]] for a brief history and description of the subject area. See [[Naive set theory]], [[Axiomatic set theory]], and [[Function (mathematics)|Function]] for definitions concerning sets and functions. The following articles may also be useful. These either contain specialised vocabulary within general topology or provide more detailed expositions of the definitions given below. The [[list of general topology topics]] and the [[list of examples in general topology]] will also be very helpful. * [[Compact space]] * [[Connected space]] * [[Continuity (topology)|Continuity]] * [[Metric space]] * [[Separated sets]] * [[Separation axiom]] * [[Topological space]] * [[Uniform space]] All spaces in this glossary are assumed to be [[topological space]]s unless stated otherwise. __NOTOC__ {{CompactTOC2}} == A == ;Accessible: See [[T1 space|'''<math>T_1</math>''']]. ;Accumulation point: See [[limit point]]. ;[[Alexandrov topology]]: A space ''X'' has the [[Alexandrov topology]] (or is '''finitely generated''') if arbitrary intersections of open sets in ''X'' are open, or equivalently, if arbitrary unions of closed sets are closed. ;Almost discrete: A space is almost discrete if every open set is closed (hence clopen). The almost discrete spaces are precisely the finitely generated zero-dimensional spaces. ;[[Approach space]]: An [[approach space]] is a generalization of metric space based on point-to-set distances, instead of point-to-point. == B == ;Baire space: This has two distinct common meanings: :#A space is a '''Baire space''' if the intersection of any [[countable]] collection of dense open sets is dense; see [[Baire space]]. :#'''Baire space''' is the set of all functions from the natural numbers to the natural numbers, with the topology of pointwise convergence; see [[Baire space (set theory)]]. ;[[Base (topology)|Base]]: A collection ''B'' of open sets is a [[base (topology)|base]] (or '''basis''') for a topology <math>\tau</math> if every open set in <math>\tau</math> is a union of sets in <math> B </math>. The topology <math>\tau</math> is the smallest topology on <math>X</math> containing <math>B</math> and is said to be generated by<math>B</math>. ;[[Basis (topology)|Basis]]: See '''[[Base (topology)|Base]]'''. ;[[Borel algebra]]: The [[Borel algebra]] on a topological space <math> (X,\tau)</math> is the smallest [[Sigma-algebra|<math>\sigma</math>-algebra]] containing all the open sets. It is obtained by taking intersection of all <math>\sigma</math>-algebras on <math> X </math> containing <math> \tau </math>. ;Borel set: A Borel set is an element of a Borel algebra. ;[[Boundary (topology)|Boundary]]: The [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] (or '''frontier''') of a set is the set's closure minus its interior. Equivalently, the boundary of a set is the intersection of its closure with the closure of its complement. Boundary of a set <math> A </math> is denoted by <math> \partial A</math> ;[[Bounded]]: A set in a metric space is [[bounded set|bounded]] if it has [[finite set|finite]] diameter. Equivalently, a set is bounded if it is contained in some open ball of finite radius. A [[function (mathematics)|function]] taking values in a metric space is [[bounded function|bounded]] if its [[image (functions)|image]] is a bounded set. ==C== ;[[Category of topological spaces]]: The [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of topological spaces|Top]]''' has [[topological space]]s as [[object (category theory)|objects]] and [[continuous map]]s as [[morphism]]s. ;[[Cauchy sequence]]: A [[sequence]] {''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} in a metric space (''M'', ''d'') is a [[Cauchy sequence]] if, for every [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] ''r'', there is an [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all integers ''m'', ''n'' > ''N'', we have ''d''(''x''<sub>''m''</sub>, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) < ''r''. ;[[Clopen set]]: A set is [[clopen set|clopen]] if it is both open and closed. ;Closed ball: If (''M'', ''d'') is a [[metric space]], a closed ball is a set of the form ''D''(''x''; ''r'') := {''y'' in ''M'' : ''d''(''x'', ''y'') â‰¤ ''r''}, where ''x'' is in ''M'' and ''r'' is a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]], the '''radius''' of the ball. A closed ball of radius ''r'' is a '''closed ''r''-ball'''. Every closed ball is a closed set in the topology induced on ''M'' by ''d''. Note that the closed ball ''D''(''x''; ''r'') might not be equal to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the open ball ''B''(''x''; ''r''). ;[[Closed set]]: A set is [[Closed set|closed]] if its complement is a member of the topology. ;Closed function: A function from one space to another is closed if the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every closed set is closed. ;[[Closure (topology)|Closure]]: The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a set is the smallest closed set containing the original set. It is equal to the intersection of all closed sets which contain it. An element of the closure of a set ''S'' is a '''point of closure''' of ''S''. ;Closure operator: See '''[[Kuratowski closure
