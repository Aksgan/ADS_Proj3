His advanced age gives him the upper hand against [[#Pitr|Pitr]], whom he has outdone on several occasions; including in a coffee brewing competition and in a (rather biased) game of Jeopardy. Unlike Pitr, he has no evil ambitions per se, but he is a friend of [[Hastur]] and [[#Cthulhu|Cthulhu]].

He can't understand the way techies think and treats them rather condescendingly, so he doesn't get very far with them. He lusts for Miranda, but she quite wisely refuses to have anything to do with him. He sucks at [[Quake (video game)|Quake]]. Although he admires the power of [[Microsoft]]'s marketing muscle, he has a real problem with Microsoft salesmen, probably because they make much more money than he does. He has a strange relationship with women and is universally hated by the geeks.

He is very keen for people to remain addicted to [[caffeine]] (and, in one strip, [[THC]]), and will sometimes invite people to suck directly out of his nose to ensure their fealty. Mr Cola takes the form of the drug most enjoyed by the particular person looking at him. For Greg, he appears as a large can of cola; for Miranda, as (presumably) a cup of [[espresso]] [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19981028]; and, for Sid, as a "big, juicy, thirty-kilogram [[Spliff|doobie]]" [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20010507]. ===Crud Puppy=== :''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980224&mode=classic February 24, 1998]'' Crud Puppy is [[#Dust Puppy|Dust Puppy]]'s nemesis, he "has the gnarled hands of a [[Microsoft]] programmer".
