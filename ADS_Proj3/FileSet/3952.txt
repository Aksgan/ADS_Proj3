entity or not. The validation of that claim is commonly referred to as [[authentication]]. The term '''authentication store''' is synonymous with Security Store. {{DEFAULTSORT:Security Store}} [[Category:Authentication methods]] {{Comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>33705</id> <title>Seismic attribute</title> <text>A '''seismic attribute''' is any quantity derived from [[Reflection seismology|seismic data]] using measured time, amplitude, frequency, attenuation or any combination of these. It intends to output a subset of the data that quantifies [[rock physics|rock and fluid properties]] and/or allows the recognition of [[geology|geologic patterns]] and features. Almost all seismic attributes are post-stack but there are a few pre-stack ones. They can be measured along a single seismic trace or throughout various seismic traces. The first attributes developed were related to the 1D [[seismic trace|complex seismic trace]] and included: envelope amplitude, instantaneous phase, instantaneous frequency, and apparent polarity. Acoustic impedance obtained from [[seismic inversion]] can also be considered an attribute and was among the first developed.<ref name=Sheriff>{{cite book|first=R.E.|last=Sheriff|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics|year=2002|edition=4|publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]]|isbn=1560801182}}</ref> Other attributes commonly used include: coherence, azimuth, dip, instantaneous amplitude, response amplitude, response phase, instantaneous bandwidth, [[Amplitude versus offset|AVO]], and spectral decomposition. ==Amplitude attributes== Amplitude attributes use the seismic signal amplitude as the basis for their computation. ===Mean amplitude=== A post-stack attribute that computes the arithmetic mean of the amplitudes of a trace within a specified window. This can be used to observe the trace bias which could indicate the presence of bright spots. ===Average Energy=== A post-stack attribute that computes the sum of the squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. This provides a measure of reflectivity and allows one to map direct hydrocarbon indicators within a zone of interest. ===RMS (root mean square) amplitude=== A post-stack attribute that computes the square root of the sum of squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. With this, one can measure reflectivity in order to map direct hydrocarbon indicators in a zone of interest. However, RMS is sensitive to noise as it squares every value within the window. ===Maximum magnitude=== A post-stack attribute that computes the maximum value of the absolute value of the amplitudes within a window. This can be used to map the strongest direct hydrocarbon indicator within a zone of interest. ===[[Amplitude versus offset|AVO (amplitude versus offset)]] attributes=== These are pre-stack attributes that include: AVO intercept, AVO gradient, intercept multiplied by gradient, far minus near, fluid factor.<ref name=Castagna>{{cite book|first1=J.P.|last1=Castagna|first2=M.M.|last2=Backus|title=Offset Dependent Reflectivity - Theory and Practice of AVO Analysis|year=1993|publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]]|isbn=1560800593}}</ref> ==Time attributes== ===Coherence=== A post-stack attribute that measures the continuity between seismic traces in a specified window. It can be used to map the lateral extent of a formation. It can also be used to see faults, channels or other discontinuous features. ===Dip=== A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) or line (2D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the magnitude of [[Strike and dip|dip (gradient)]] of said plane or line measured in degrees. This can be used to create a pseudo paleogeologic map on a horizon slice. ===Azimuth=== A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the direction of maximum slope (dip direction) measured in degrees, clockwise from north. This is not to be confused with the geological concept of azimuth, which is equivalent to [[Strike and dip|strike]] and is measured 90Â° counterclockwise from the dip direction. ==References== <references/> ==Further reading== {{Refbegin}} * {{Cite book|author1=S.

In practice, SOC aims to limit the output of high definition video over non-secure analog outputs such as [[Component video|component video connections]]. When enabled, SOC will only output high definition content over a [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface]] (HDMI) to devices that are [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] (HDCP) approved. This means that when SOC is enabled for a program, older televisions that do not have an HDMI port or are not HDCP compliant will not be able to view content. The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has, until recently, had a ban on the use of SOC. On May 7, 2010 the FCC granted a limited waiver of Section 76.1903 to allow the use of SOC. This waiver was filed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) to allow the use of SOC to broadcast first run movies shortly after theatrical release, but prior to home video release. The MPAA argued that member companies (the studios) would not agree to releasing these movies to the On-Demand market without the ability to enforce copy protection, which analog outputs such as component video connections lack. The concern being that unprotected analog output is open to piracy. The FCC agreed that it would be in the public interest to allow the use of SOC since it would allow more Americans who may have difficulty getting to the movies the opportunity to enjoy first run movies in the home. The FCC cites an example using homebound parents with young children that may have a hard time getting to the movies due to not being able to find a babysitter. The [http://www.aapd.com American Association of People with Disabilities] is also in favor of the MPAA's plan to offer high-definition first run movies before home video release because it would increase the entertainment options that disabled Americans have in the home. The waiver granted by the FCC is limited in that it does not enable all of the actions
