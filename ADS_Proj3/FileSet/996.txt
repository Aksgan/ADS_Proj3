The production model 3-rotor bombes contained 36 scramblers arranged in three banks of twelve. Each bank was used for a different ''wheel order'' by fitting it with the drums that corresponded to the Enigma rotors being tested. The first bombe was named ''Victory'' and was delivered to Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940. The next one, which included the diagonal board, was delivered on 8 August 1940. It was referred to as a ''spider bombe'' and was named ''Agnus Dei'' which soon became ''Agnes'' and then ''Aggie''. The production of British bombes was relatively slow at first, with only five bombes being in use in June 1941, 15 by the year end,<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) pp. 253-256</ref> 30 by September 1942, 49 by January 1943<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 230</ref> but eventually 210 at the end of the war. A refinement that was developed for use on messages from those networks that disallowed plugboard (''Stecker'') connection of adjacent letters, was the ''Consecutive Stecker Knock Out''. This was fitted to 40 Bombes and produced a useful reduction in false stops.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Harper | first = John | publication-date = Spring 2009 | periodical = Resurrection: the bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society | publisher = British Computer Society | issue = 46 | pages = 7–8 | title = Bombe Rebuild Project | url = http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection.htm | accessdate = 22 May 2009 }}</ref> Initially the bombes were operated by ex-BTM servicemen, but in March 1941 the first detachment of members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (known as ''Wrens'') arrived at Bletchley Park to become bombe operators. By 1945 there were some 2,000 Wrens operating the bombes.<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) p. 75 </ref> Because of the risk of bombing, relatively few of bombes were located at Bletchley Park. The largest two outstations were at Eastcote (some 110 bombes and 800 Wrens) and Stanmore (some 50 bombes and 500 Wrens). There were also bombe outstations at Wavendon, Adstock and Gayhurst. Communication with Bletchley Park was by teleprinter (teletype) links. When the German Navy started using 4-rotor Enigmas, about sixty 4-rotor bombes were produced at Letchworth, some with the assistance of the [[General Post Office]].<ref>{{ Citation | contribution = Bombe Types | contribution-url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/types1.htm | editor-last = Harper | editor-first = John | title = The British Bombe CANTAB | url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm }}</ref> The [[NCR Corporation|NCR]]-manufactured [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy 4-rotor bombes]] were, however, very fast and much the most successful.

The messages were decoded in [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park and turned into intelligence reports in Hut 3.<ref>Calvocoressi (2001) p. 74</ref> The network code-named ‘Red’ at Bletchley Park was broken regularly and quickly from 22 May 1940 until the end of hostilities. Indeed, the Air Force section of Hut 3 expected the new day’s Enigma settings to have been established in Hut 6 by breakfast time. The relative ease of breaking this network’s settings was a product of plentiful cribs and frequent German [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|operating mistakes]].<ref>Calvocoressi (2001) p. 87</ref> ===''Abwehr'' Enigma=== [[Image:Enigma-G.jpg|thumb|Enigma Model G, used by the ''[[Abwehr]]''. It had three ordinary rotors and a rotating reflector, multiple notches on the rotor rings, but no plugboard.]] [[Dilly Knox|Dilly Knox's]] last great cryptanalytical success before his untimely death in February 1943, was the breaking, in 1941, of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' Enigma. Intercepts of traffic which had an 8-letter [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] sequence before the usual 5-letter groups, led to the suspicion that a 4-rotor machine was being used.<ref>[[Peter Twinn|Twinn]] (1993) p. 127</ref> The assumption was correctly made that the indicator consisted of a 4-letter message key enciphered twice. In fact the machine was a [[Enigma machine#Military Enigma|Model G Enigma]], which had no plugboard, three conventional rotors, and a rotating reflector that could both be set by hand and was advanced by the [[Enigma machine#Stepping motion|stepping mechanism]]. Collecting a set of enciphered message keys for a particular day allowed ''cycles'' (or ''boxes'' as Knox called them) to be assembled in a similar way to the method used by the Poles in the 1930s.<ref name=FCarterAbwehr/> Knox was able to derive, using his ''buttoning up'' procedure,<ref name=CarterButtoningUp /> some of the wiring of the rotor that had been loaded in the fast position on that day. Progressively he was able to derive the wiring of all three rotors. Once that had been done, he was able to work out the wiring of the reflector.<ref name=FCarterAbwehr>{{ Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = The Abwehr Enigma Machine | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/resources/file.rhtm/261894/web+abwehr2.pdf }}</ref> Deriving the indicator setting for that day was achieved using Knox's time-consuming ''rodding'' procedure.<ref name=CarterRodding /> This involved a great deal of trial and error, imagination and crossword puzzle-solving skills, but was helped by ''cillies''. The ''Abwehr'' was the [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] and [[espionage|counter-espionage]] service of the German High Command. The spies that it placed in enemy countries used a lower level cipher (which was broken by [[Oliver Strachey|Oliver Strachey's]] section at [[Bletchley Park]]) for their transmissions. However, the messages were often
