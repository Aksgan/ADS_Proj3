in Princeton, creating a database of synchronized parallel sequences of random numbers. The GCP is run as a replication experiment, essentially combining the results of many distinct tests of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is tested by calculating the extent of data fluctuations at the time of events. The procedure is specified by a three-step experimental protocol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/pdf/GCP.Events.Mar08.prepress.pdf|title=Ibid. p.6 }}</ref> In the first step, the event duration and the calculation algorithm are pre-specified and entered into a formal registry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/pred_formal.html|title=GCP Event registry|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> In the second step, the event data are extracted from the database and a [[Z score]], which indicates the degree of deviation from the null hypothesis, is calculated from the pre-specified algorithm. In the third step, the event Z-score is combined with the Z-scores from previous events to yield an overall result for the experiment. The GCP claims that, as of late 2009, the cumulative result of more than 300 registered events significantly supports their hypothesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/results.html|title=GCP Event summaries|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> The remote devices have been dubbed ''Princeton Eggs'', a reference to the coinage ''electrogaiagram'', a [[portmanteau]] of [[electroencephalogram]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/story.html|title=Gathering of a global mind|accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> Supporters and skeptics have referred to the aim of the GCP as being analogous to detecting "a great disturbance in [[Force (Star Wars)|The Force]]."<ref name=schiavo/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/williams/GCP911.html|title=Exploratory Block Analysis of Field Consciousness Effects on Global RNGs on September 11, 2001|last=Williams|first=Bryan J.|date=12 August 2002|work=Noosphere|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boundaryinstitute.org/bi/randomness.htm|title=A disturbance in the Force...?|first=December 2001|work=Boundary Institute|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> ==Criticism== Based on an exploratory analysis of 'highly statistically significant' experimental results, the GCP has suggested changes in the level of randomness may have occurred during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] at the times of the plane impacts and the building collapses, and over the two days following the disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/terror.html|title="September 11, 2001: Exploratory and Contextual Analyses"|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> Moreover, the GCP has identified similar 'anomalies' in the EGG data hours and even days before the attacks; while the GCP does not claim a causal relationship,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/terror1.html|title="Extended Analysis: September 11, 2001 in Context"|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> such changes&mdash;if genuine&mdash;would seem to imply either subconscious mass [[precognition]], or [[retrocausality|backwards causality]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/nelson-pp.pdf|title=Correlations of Continuous Random Data with Major World Events|last=Nelson et al. |work=Foundations of Physics Letters|date=2002| accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref> Independent scientists Edwin May and James Spottiswoode conducted an analysis of the data around the 11 September 2001 events and concluded there was no statistically significant change in the randomness of the GCP data during the attacks and the apparent significant deviation reported by Nelson and Radin existed only in their chosen time window.<ref name="MaySpottiswoode">May, E.C e.a.
