ACLU]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] partially overturned the law.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Judge [[Stewart R. Dalzell]], one of the three federal judges who in June 1996 declared parts of the CDA unconstitutional, in his opinion stated the following:<ref name="Stanford University">[www.stanford.edu/~steener/handouts/exsource2.doc Stanford University]</ref> <blockquote> "The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than print, the village green, or the mails. Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. This is a constitutionally intolerable result. Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional discourse. Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar – in a word, “indecent” in many communities. But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates. [. . .] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication. The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography. [. . .] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well. In my view, our action today should only mean that Government’s permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [. . .] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff’s experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: “What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is chaos.” Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects."<ref name="Stanford University"/> </blockquote> The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the "[[Information society|Information Society]]" in stating: <blockquote> "We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
