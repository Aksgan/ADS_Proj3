WPT format allows [[web crawlers]] to generate [[Semantic Web|Semantic Web’s]] [[Resource Description Framework|RDFs]] for [[web pages]]. WPT is compatible with existing [[Semantic Web]] concepts defined by [[W3C]] ([[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]) and [[Universal Networking Language|UNL]] specifications. == WPT Syntax == [[Image:ICDL Visual Representation.png|335px|thumb|Website Parse Template's Visual Representation]] Website Parse Template consists of following sections:<br /> * '''''[[Ontology_(information_science)|Ontology]]''''', where [[Web publisher|publisher]] defines concepts and relations which are used in the [[website]]. * '''''[[Template (software engineering)|Templates]]''''', where [[Web publisher|publisher]] provides templates for groups of [[web pages]] which are similar by their content category and structure. Publisher provides the [[HTML element|HTML elements’]] XPath or TagIDs and links with [[website]] Ontology concepts. * '''''[[URLs]]''''', where [[Web publisher|publisher]] provides URL [[Regular expression|Patterns]] which collect the group of [[web pages]] linking them to "Parse Template". In the [[URLs]] section publisher can separate form URLs the part as a concept and link to website [[Ontology]]. Website Parse Template begins with opening <''icdl''> tag and ends with closing </''icdl''> tag. Single Website Parse Template is referred to the same [[Web host|host]], while single host may have several Website Parse Templates describing its [[HTML]] structure. It is required to specify the host for Website Parse Template at the beginning in <''icdl''> tag: <source lang="xml"> <icdl host="http://music.yahoo.com"> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </icdl> </source> === WPT Ontology === [[Ontology_(information_science)|Ontology]] section contains enumeration and definition of all [[concepts]] used in [[website]]. Listed concepts must be enclosed within <''ontology''> </''ontology''> [[Tag (metadata)|tags]]. It is required to specify the ontology name (any rational [[String (computer science)|string]]) and indicate supported [[Formal language|language]] ("''icdl:ontology''", "''[[Web Ontology Language|owl]]''" or "''[[Universal Networking Language|unl:uws]]''") which is used to specify the concepts.
