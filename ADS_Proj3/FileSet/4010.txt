is obstructed by an object. It occupies all of the space behind an opaque object with light in front of it. The cross section of a shadow is a two-dimensional silhouette, or reverse projection of the object blocking the light. An astronomical object casts human-visible shadows when its apparent magnitude is equal or lower than -4. Currently the only astronomical objects able to produce visible shadows on Earth are the sun, the moon and, in the right conditions, the planet Venus. ==Variation with time== Shadow length changes dramatically throughout the day. The length of a shadow cast on the ground is proportional to the [[Trigonometric functions#Reciprocal functions|cotangent]] of the sun's [[Altitude (astronomy)#Elevation angle|elevation angle]]—its angle θ relative to the horizon. Near sunrise and sunset, when θ = 0° and cot(θ) is infinite, shadows can be extremely long. If the sun passes directly overhead, then θ = 90°, cot(θ)=0, and shadows are cast directly underneath objects. == Non-point == [[File:Diagram of umbra, penumbra & antumbra.png|thumb|right|[[Umbra|Umbra, penumbra]] and [[antumbra]]]] For a non-[[point source]] of light, the shadow is divided into the [[Umbra|umbra and penumbra]]. The wider the light source, the more blurred the shadow. If there are multiple light sources there are multiple shadows, with overlapping parts darker, or a combination of colors. For a person or object touching the surface, like a person standing on the ground, or a pole in the ground, these converge at the point of touch. == Shadow propagation speed == [[File:Steam phase eruption of Castle Geyser with crepuscular rays and shadow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Steam]] phase [[eruption]] of [[Castle Geyser]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] casts a shadow on its own [[steam]]. [[Crepuscular rays]] are also seen.]] [[File:Vapour shadow.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Shadow cast by [[vapour]] trail of passing [[aircraft]]]] The farther the distance from the object blocking the light to the surface of projection, the larger the silhouette (they are considered [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]]). Also, if the object is moving, the shadow cast by the object will project an image with dimensions (length) expanding proportionally faster than the object's own length of movement. The increase of size and movement is also true if the distance between the object of interference and the light source are closer. This, however, does not mean the shadow may move faster than light, even when projected at vast distances, such as [[light year]]s. The loss of light, which projects the shadow, will move towards the surface of projection at [[light speed]]. . The misconception is that the edge of a shadow "moves" along a wall, when in actuality the increase of a shadow's length is part of a new projection, which will propagate at the speed of light from the object of interference. [[File:Fog shadow tv tower.jpg|Fog Shadow of [[Sutro Tower]]|150px|thumb|left]]Since there is no actual communication between points in a shadow (except for reflection or interference of light, at the speed of light), a shadow that projects over a surface of large distances (light years) cannot give information between those distances with the shadow's edge.<ref>[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/FTL.html#3 Is Faster-Than-Light Travel or Communication Possible?] by Philip Gibbs</ref> [[File:Fog shadow of GGB.jpg|Fog Shadow of the South Tower of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]|200px|thumb]] == Fog shadows== [[File:CloudsShadow.jpg|Clouds and shadows over the Mediterranean|200px|thumb]]Fog shadows look odd since humans are not used to seeing shadows in three dimensions. The thin fog is just dense enough to be illuminated by the light that passes through the gaps in a structure or in a tree. As a result, the path of an object shadow through the "fog" appears darkened. In a sense, these shadow lanes are similar to [[crepuscular rays]], which are caused by cloud shadows, but here, they are caused by the shadows of solid objects. ==Other notes== A shadow cast by the [[Earth]] on the [[Moon]] is a [[lunar eclipse]]. Conversely, a shadow cast by the Moon on the Earth is a [[solar eclipse]]. On [[satellite imagery]] and [[aerial photograph]]s, taken vertically, tall buildings can be recognized as such by their long shadows (if the photographs are not taken in the tropics around noon), while these also show more of the shape of these buildings. [[File:British Library Gate Shadow.jpg|thumb|Inverted shadow of text]] A shadow shows, apart from distortion, the same image as the silhouette when looking at the object from the sun-side, hence the [[mirror image]] of the silhouette seen from the other side (see picture). ''Shadow'' as a term is often used for any occlusion, not just those with respect to light. For example, a [[rain shadow]] is a dry area, which, with respect to the prevailing [[wind]] direction, is beyond a [[mountain range]]; the range is "blocking" water from crossing the area. An [[acoustic shadow]] can be created by terrain as well that will leave spots that can't easily hear sounds from a distance. Sciophobia, or Sciaphobia, is the Fear of shadows. ==Mythological connotations== {{main|ghost}} An unattended shadow or [[ghost|shade]] was thought by some cultures to be similar to that of a ghost. It is also believed as an alternative construct that shadows are in fact a representation of God's presence around an object; like a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. Early eastern beliefs also play to this theory. ==Heraldry== In [[heraldry]], when a charge is supposedly shown in shadow (the appearance is of the charge merely being outlined in a neutral tint rather than being of one or more [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]s different from the field on which it is placed), it is called ''umbrated''. Supposedly only a limited number of specific charges can be so depicted. ==See also== {{commons|Shadow}} * [[Black drop effect]] * [[Convolution#Applications|Convolution applications]], for more physical and mathematical discussion about shadows * [[Gnomon]] * [[Shade]] * [[Shadow mapping]], in computer 3D graphics * [[Shadow people]] * [[Shadow play]] ==References== {{reflist|small}} ==External links== *[http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/40702/seeing-shadows Seeing Shadows] - slideshow by ''[[Life magazine]]'' [[Category:Optical phenomena]] [[Category:Shading]] [[f [[am:ጥላ]] [[ar:ظل]] [[gn:Kuarahy'ã]] [[bg:Сянка]] [[ca:Ombra]] [[cs:Stín]] [[da:Skygge]] [[de:Schatten]] [[el:Σκιά]] [[es:Sombra]] [[eo:Ombro]] [[fa:سایه]] [[fr:Ombre]] [[gl:Sombra]] [[ko:그림자]] [[hi:छाया]] [[io:Ombro]] [[id:Bayang-bayang]] [[it:Ombra]] [[he:צל]] [[ka:ჩრდილი]] [[lv:Ēna]] [[lt:Šešėlis]] [[hu:Árnyék]] [[ml:നിഴല്‍]] [[nl:Schaduw]] [[ja:影]] [[no:Skygge]] [[nn:Skugge]] [[pl:Cień]] [[pt:Sombra]] [[ro:Umbră]] [[qu:Llanthu]] [[ru:Тень]] [[scn:Ùmmira]] [[simple:Shadow]] [[sk:Tieň]] [[sr:Сјенка]] [[fi:Varjo]]
