By design, it acts as a front end for several programs, for example the [[QScintilla]] editor widget, the python language interpreter, Bicycle Repair Man for [[code refactoring]], [[Python Profiler]] for [[code profiling]]. Any functionality that is not required does not have to be installed. It is written using the [[PyQt]] Python bindings for the [[Qt (framework)|Qt GUI toolkit]]. The main features are a project manager, an editor with syntax highlighting, debugging, profiling, running python code with support for command-line parameters, [[unit testing]], [[user interface]] design, a console for program output and a task manager (self-updating [[TODO list]]). Several allusions are made to the British comedy group [[Monty Python]], which the Python programming language is named after. Eric alludes to [[Eric Idle]], a member of the group. [[Bicycle Repair Man]] is named after the Monty Python skit of the same name. === Debugger === Eric includes an integrated graphical debugger, that supports interactive probing while suspended and auto breaking on exceptions. == See also == * [[List of integrated development environments for Python]] == References == * Reg.
