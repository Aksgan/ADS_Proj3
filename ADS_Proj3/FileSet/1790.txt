a [[mathematician]]: <blockquote>As is well known, the theory of the [[maxima and minima]] of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] was indebted to him for the greatest progress through the discovery of the method of [[tangent]]s. Well, he conceives God in the creation of the world like a mathematician who is solving a minimum problem, or rather, in our modern phraseology, a problem in the [[calculus of variations]]{{ndash}} the question being to determine among an infinite number of possible worlds, that for which the sum of necessary evil is a minimum.</blockquote> The statement that "we live in the best of all possible worlds" drew scorn, most notably from [[Voltaire]], who lampooned it in his comic novella ''[[Candide]]'' by having the character Dr. Pangloss (a parody of Leibniz and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]]) repeat it like a [[mantra]]. From this, the adjective "[[wikt:Panglossian|Panglossian]]" describes a person who believes that the world about us is the best possible one. ===Symbolic thought=== Leibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations of a sort, and that such calculations could resolve many differences of opinion: <blockquote>The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate [''calculemus''], without further ado, to see who is right.<ref>''The Art of Discovery'' 1685, Wiener 51</ref></blockquote> Leibniz's [[calculus ratiocinator]], which resembles [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], can be viewed as a way of making such calculations feasible. Leibniz wrote memoranda<ref>Many of his memoranda are translated in Parkinson 1966.</ref> that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic—and thus his ''calculus''—off the ground. But Gerhard and Couturat did not publish these writings until modern formal logic had emerged in [[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and in writings by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and his students in the 1880s, and hence well after [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] began that logic in 1847. Leibniz thought [[symbol]]s were important for human understanding. He attached so much importance to the invention of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this. His notation for the [[infinitesimal calculus]] is an example of his skill in this regard. C.S. Peirce, a 19th-century pioneer of [[semiotics]], shared Leibniz's passion for symbols and notation, and his belief that these are essential to a well-running logic and mathematics. But Leibniz took his speculations much further. Defining a [[Grapheme|character]] as any written sign, he then defined a "real" character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea. Some real characters, such as the notation of logic, serve only to facilitate reasoning. Many characters well-known in his day, including [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]], [[Chinese character]]s, and the symbols of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], he deemed not real.<ref>Loemker, however, who translated some of Leibniz's works into English, said that the symbols of chemistry were real characters, so there is disagreement among Leibniz scholars on this point.</ref><!--is this paragraph correct up to this point?--> Instead, he proposed the creation of a ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' or "universal characteristic", built on an [[alphabet of human thought]] in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique "real" character: <blockquote>It is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters ''insofar as they are subject to reasoning'' all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.<ref>''Preface to the General Science'', 1677. Revision of Rutherford's translation in Jolley 1995: 234. Also Wiener I.4</ref></blockquote> Complex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of [[prime factorization]] suggests a central role for [[prime numbers]] in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of [[Gödel numbering]]. Granted, there is no intuitive or [[mnemonic]] way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers. Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations however remarkably foreshadows great 20th century developments in formal systems, such as [[Turing completeness]], where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see [[Turing degree]]). Because Leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the ''characteristic'', at first he did not conceive it as an [[algebra]] but rather as a [[universal characteristic|universal language]] or script. Only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of "algebra of thought", modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation. The resulting ''characteristic'' included a logical calculus, some combinatorics, algebra, his ''analysis situs'' (geometry of situation), a universal concept language, and more. What Leibniz actually intended by his ''characteristica universalis'' and calculus ratiocinator, and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to the calculus, may never be established.<ref>A good introductory discussion of the "characteristic" is Jolley (1995: 226–40). An early, yet still classic, discussion of the "characteristic" and "calculus" is Couturat (1901: chpts. 3,4).</ref> ===Formal logic=== {{Main|Algebraic logic}} Leibniz is the most important logician between Aristotle and 1847, when [[George Boole]] and [[Augustus De Morgan]] each published books that began modern formal logic. Leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]], [[negation]], [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], set [[subset|inclusion]], and the [[empty set]]. The principles of Leibniz's logic and, arguably, of his whole philosophy, reduce to two: #All our ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas, which form the [[alphabet of human thought]]. #Complex ideas proceed from these simple ideas by a uniform and symmetrical combination, analogous to arithmetical multiplication. With regard to the first point, the number of simple ideas is much greater than Leibniz thought.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} As for the second, logic can indeed be grounded in a symmetrical combining operation, but that operation is analogous to either of addition or multiplication.{{Citation needed|date=April
