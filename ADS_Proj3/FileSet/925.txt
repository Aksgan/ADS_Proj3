(2005) ''Construction Collaboration Technologies: The Extranet Evolution'' Taylor & Francis, London, pp.6-7.</ref> It also supported progressive moves within the UK construction industry to promote more collaborative or integrated approaches following the 1994 [[Latham Report|Latham]] and 1998 [[Egan Report]]s. For example, Sir John Egan's follow-up report, ''Accelerating Change'' in 2002, recommended: :'Integrated teams, created at the optimal time in the process and ''using an integrated IT approach'', that fully release the contribution each can make and equitably share risk and reward in a non-adversarial way.' (p.10, emphasis added)<ref>Egan, J. (2002) ''Accelerating Change'': Consultation Paper by Strategic Forum for Construction, London: HMSO.</ref> Other descriptions such as 'construction [[project management]]' or 'construction [[document management]]' were seen as confusing or misleading, being associated more with scheduling tools (e.g.: [[Microsoft Project]]) or with generic electronic document management systems (e.g.: [[Documentum]]) that could not easily handle AEC-oriented requirements for dispersed teams. ==Characteristics== Essentially, construction collaboration technologies are deployed to support the requirements of a multi-disciplinary construction project team. This is typically drawn from multiple companies, all based in different locations with their own IT systems, and is brought together – usually temporarily – to plan, design, construct and, in some cases, to operate and maintain the resulting built asset.<ref>http://ncctp.constructingexcellence.org.uk/about_ct.jsp Collaboration Technologies Explained (NCCTP)</ref> Construction collaboration technologies replace localised sets of data held by individual team members or companies. A centralised repository or data store is created that can be accessed by all authorised team members, usually using a lowest common denominator technology: a computer equipped with an internet browser and a telecommunications link to the internet. The platforms' functionality also reflects the industry's extensive use of graphical information - most notably design drawings - and the need to be able to access, view, mark-up and comment on designs. The core characteristics of construction collaboration technologies can be summarised<ref>Wilkinson, P. (2005), pp.65-94.</ref> as: * Organisation features (i.e.: security settings, user administration, information administration) * Communication features (i.e.: file publication, management, feedback) * Management features (i.e.: management of specific workflows, teams, work packages, multiple projects, standards) * Sharing, viewing and working with [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]-based drawings (including use of viewing tools) Reflecting the need to encourage take-up and active use of their platforms, the leading UK construction collaboration technology vendors all adopted a similar charging structure. Rather than charging companies per-user or per-seat licenses, the applications were typically licensed per-project, with customers paying a single subscription (typically monthly or quarterly) for the duration of the planning, design and construction process, and allowing use by all companies in the project's supply chain. ==Vendors== The founder members of the NCCTP were (in alphabetical order): [[4Projects]], Asite, [[BIW Technologies]], BuildOnline (today [[Sword-CTSpace]]), [[Cadweb]], [[Causeway Technologies]] and [[Sarcophagus Ltd|Sarcophagus]]. Business Collaborator (today UNIT4 Collaboration Software) and [[Aconex]] joined shortly afterwards. The NCCTP was initially managed by [[CIRIA]] before becoming a membership forum within [[Constructing Excellence]] in August 2007. Other vendors/products in this sector include (in alphabetical order): [[Autodesk]]'s Buzzsaw and Constructware platforms, [[Bentley Systems]]' ProjectWise, Bricsnet, Conject, CoreCon, ePin, Kalexo, Incite, iSite, Meridian Systems' Prolog, Proliance and ProTalk platforms, and Woobius. There are also construction-oriented implementations of [[Microsoft]]'s [[SharePoint]] platform, e.g.: Cadac's Organice, ProgramNetInc's ProgramNet Portal and CMBoost. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== * [[Extranet]] * [[List of collaborative software]] [[Category:Construction]] [[Category:Building]] [[Category:Software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7885</id> <title>Construction industry of the United Kingdom</title> <text>The '''construction industry of the United Kingdom''' contributed gross value of £64,747 million to the UK economy in 2004.<ref name=bluebook>{{cite web |title=United Kingdom National Accounts The Blue Book 2006 |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/BlueBook2006.pdf |format=PDF|date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> The industry employed around 2.2 million people in the fourth quarter of 2009.<ref name=constructionannual>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_commerce/CSA-2010/Opening%20page.pdf|title=Construction Statistics Annual 2010|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> There were around 194,000 construction firms in [[Great Britain]] in 2009, of which around 75,400 employed just one person and 62 employed over 1,200 people.<ref name=constructionannual/> In 2009 the construction industry in Great Britain received total orders of around £18.7 billion from the private sector and £15.1 billion from the public sector.<ref name=constructionannual/> ==See also== * [[UK Contractors Group]] * [[Architecture of the United Kingdom]] ==References== <div class='references-small'> <references/> </div> {{Economy of the United Kingdom}} [[Category:Construction]] [[Category:Building]] [[Category:Economy of the United Kingdom]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7895</id> <title>Constructive alignment</title> <text>'''Constructive alignment''' is a principle used for devising [[teaching]] and [[learning]] activities, and assessment tasks, that directly address the learning outcomes intended in a way not typically achieved in traditional [[lecture]]s, [[tutorial]] classes and examinations (Biggs and Tang, 2007). Constructive alignment was devised by [[Professor]] [[John B. Biggs]], and represents a marriage between a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] understanding of the nature of learning, and an aligned design for outcomes-based teaching education. Constructive alignment is the underpinning concept behind the current requirements for programme specification, declarations of Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) and assessment criteria, and
