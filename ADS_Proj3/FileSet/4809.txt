with disk space from one disk. *'''Spanned volumes''', where up to 32 disks show up as one, increasing it in size but not enhancing performance. When one disk fails, the array is destroyed. Some data may be recoverable. This corresponds to [[JBOD#Concatenation (JBOD or SPAN)|JBOD]] and not to [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|RAID-1]]. *'''Striped volumes''', also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 0|RAID-0]], store all their data across several disks in ''stripes''. This allows better performance because disk reads and writes are balanced across multiple disks. === Accessibility === With Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the Windows 9x accessibility features for people with visual and auditory impairments and other [[disability|disabilities]] into the NT-line of operating systems.<ref name="Accessibility" /> These included: *'''[[Sticky keys|StickyKeys]]''': makes modifier keys (<tt>ALT</tt>, <tt>CTRL</tt> and <tt>SHIFT</tt>) become "sticky": a user can press the [[modifier key]], and then release it before pressing the combination key. (Activated by pressing Shift five times quickly.) *'''[[FilterKeys]]''': a group of [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]-related features for people with typing issues, including: **'''SlowKeys''': Ignore any keystroke not held down for a certain period. **'''BounceKeys''': Ignore repeated keystrokes pressed in quick succession. **'''RepeatKeys''': lets users slow down the rate at which keys are repeated via the keyboard's key-repeat feature. *'''ToggleKeys''': when turned on, Windows will play a sound when the <tt>CAPS LOCK</tt>, <tt>NUM LOCK</tt> or <tt>SCROLL LOCK</tt> key is pressed. *'''SoundSentry''': designed to help users with auditory impairments, Windows 2000 shows a visual effect when a sound is played through the sound system. *'''[[Mouse keys|MouseKeys]]''': lets users move the cursor around the screen via the [[Keypad|numeric keypad]]. *'''SerialKeys''': lets Windows 2000 support speech augmentation devices. *'''High contrast theme''': to assist users with visual impairments. *'''[[Microsoft Magnifier]]''': A [[screen magnifier]] that enlarges a part of the screen the cursor is over.<ref name="AccessTools">[http://www.student.oulu.fi/~vtatila/ms_access_aids.html A review of Microsoft Magnifier and Narrator]</ref> Additionally, Windows 2000 introduced the following new accessibility features: *'''[[On-screen keyboard]]''': displays a [[virtual keyboard]] on the screen and allows users to press its keys using a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] or a [[joystick]].<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windows2000/onscreenkeyboard.aspx On-screenk keyboard]</ref> *'''[[Microsoft Narrator]]''': Introduced in Windows 2000, this is a [[screen reader]] that utilizes the [[Speech Application Programming Interface|Speech API]] 5.<ref name="AccessTools" /> === Languages and locales === {{main|Multilingual User Interface}} Windows 2000 introduced the [[Multilingual User Interface]] (MUI).<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/muiapp.mspx Writing Win32 Multilingual User Interface Applications]</ref> Besides English, Windows 2000 incorporates support for [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Central Europe]]an, [[Cyrillic]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Indic]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Traditional Chinese]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Western Europe]]an languages.<ref name="Languages" /> It also has support for many different [[locale]]s.<ref name="Locales" /> === Games === Windows 2000 included version 7.0 of the [[DirectX]] [[Applications Programming Interface|API]], commonly used by [[video game developer|game developer]]s on [[Windows 98]].<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/community/columns/askdev/ask1208.mspx?mfr=true Ask the Windows 2000 Dev Team].</ref> The last version of DirectX that Windows 2000 supports is DirectX 9.0c (Shader Model 3.0), that shipped with Windows XP Service Pack 2. Microsoft published quarterly updates to DirectX 9.0c through the February 2010 release after which support was dropped in the June 2010 SDK. These updates contain bug fixes to the core runtime and some additional libraries such as [[D3DX]], [[DirectSound#XAudio 2|XAudio 2]], [[DirectInput#Xinput|XInput]] and [[Managed DirectX]] components. The majority of games written for versions of DirectX 9.0c (up to the February 2010 release) can therefore run on Windows 2000. ===System utilities=== [[Image:Win2kDefrag.png|thumb|right|The Windows 2000 Computer Management console can perform many system tasks. It is pictured here starting a [[disk defragmentation]].]] Windows 2000 introduced the [[Microsoft Management Console]] (MMC), which is used to create, save, and open administrative tools.<ref name="MMC" /> Each of these is called a ''console'', and most allow an administrator to administer other Windows 2000 computers from one centralised computer. Each console can contain one or many specific administrative tools, called ''snap-ins''.<ref name="MMC" /> These can be either standalone (with one function), or an extension (adding functions to an existing snap-in). In order to provide the ability to control what snap-ins can be seen in a console, the MMC allows consoles to be created in ''author mode'' or ''user mode''.<ref name="MMC" /> Author mode allows snap-ins to be added, new windows to be created, all portions of the console tree to be displayed and consoles to be saved. User mode allows consoles to be distributed with restrictions applied. User mode consoles can grant full access to the user for any change, or they can grant limited access, preventing users from adding snapins to the console though they can view multiple windows in a console. Alternatively users can be granted limited access, preventing them from adding to the console and stopping them from viewing multiple windows in a single console.<ref>''Microsoft Press'' (2000). ''MCSE 70-210, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional'', pages 58-63.</ref> The main tools that come with Windows 2000 can be found in the ''Computer Management'' console (in Administrative Tools in the Control Panel).<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726960.aspx Managing Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstations and Servers]</ref> This contains the [[Event Viewer]]&mdash;a means of seeing events and the Windows equivalent of a [[log file]],<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726966.aspx Event Logging and Viewing]</ref> a system information utility, [[NTBackup|a backup utility]], [[Task Scheduler]] and management consoles to view open shared folders and shared folder sessions, configure and manage [[COM+]] applications, configure [[Group Policy]],<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742376.aspx Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set]</ref> manage all the local users and user groups, and a [[Device Manager|device manager]].<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314747 Description of Device Manager in Windows 2000 and Windows XP]</ref> It contains ''[[Logical Disk Manager|Disk Management]]'' and ''Removable Storage'' snap-ins,<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/reskit/part3/proch18.mspx Windows 2000: Removable Storage and Backup]</ref> a [[Disk Defragmenter (Windows)|disk defragmenter]] as well as a performance diagnostic console, which displays graphs of system performance and configures data logs and alerts. It also contains a [[Windows service|service]] configuration console, which allows users to view all installed services and to stop and start them, as well as configure what those services should do when the computer starts. [[CHKDSK]] has significant performance improvements. <ref> [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/shared/community/docs/Windows%202000%20CHKDSK%20Management.doc Windows 2000 Chkdsk Management] </ref> Windows 2000 comes with two utilities to edit the [[Windows registry]], ''REGEDIT.EXE'' and ''REGEDT32.EXE''.<ref
