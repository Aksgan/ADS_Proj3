In acknowledgment of the strong influence of [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] on the ''Matrix'' series, '''''[[The Animatrix]]''''' was produced in 2003. This is a collection of nine [[animation|animated]] short films intended to further flesh out the concepts, history, characters and setting of the series. The objective of ''The Animatrix'' project was to give other writers and directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the ''Matrix'' universe; the Wachowski brothers conceived of and oversaw the process, and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by notable figures from the world of Japanese animation. Four of the films were originally released on the series' official website, one was shown in cinemas with ''[[Dreamcatcher (film)|Dreamcatcher]]'', one was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, and MTV4, and the others first appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''. ===Video games=== On May 15, 2003, the game '''''[[Enter the Matrix]]''''' was released in [[North America]] concurrently with ''The Matrix Reloaded''. The first of three video games related to the films, it told a story running parallel to ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and featured scenes shot during the filming of ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and ''The Matrix Revolutions''. Two more ''Matrix'' video games were released in 2005. The [[MMORPG]] '''''[[The Matrix Online]]''''' continued the story beyond ''The Matrix Revolutions'', while '''''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]''''' allowed players to control the series' protagonist Neo in scenes from the film trilogy. ===Comic books=== In addition, several [[comic book]]s and [[short story|short stories]] based on the series &ndash; one written by the Wachowskis, the others by guest writers &ndash; were released on the official website. Many of these have since been collected in two printed volumes of '''''[[The Matrix Comics]]'''''. ==DVD releases== Over a year after the cinematic release of the final film, ''Revolutions'', Warner Home Video released ''[[The Ultimate Matrix Collection]]'', a 10-Disc DVD set of the films. It included the three films, ''[[The Animatrix]]'', and six discs of additional material. A Limited Edition of the collection encases the ten discs, as well as a resin bust of Neo, inside a Lucite box. ==Reception== ===Awards=== {{Main|List of awards and nominations received by The Matrix franchise}} ===Box office=== {| class="wikitable" style="width:99%;" |- ! rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"| '''Film''' ! rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"| '''Release date''' ! colspan="3" style="text-align:center;"| '''Box office revenue''' ! colspan="2" style="text-align:center;" text="wrap"| '''Box office ranking''' ! rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"| '''Budget''' ! rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"| '''Reference''' |- ! style="text-align:center;"| '''United States''' ! style="text-align:center;"| '''Foreign''' ! style="text-align:center;"| '''Worldwide''' ! style="text-align:center;"| '''All time domestic''' ! style="text-align:center;"| '''All time worldwide''' |- | ''[[The Matrix]]'' | March 31, 1999 | $171,479,930 | $288,901,000 | $463,517,383 | style="text-align:center;"| #142 | style="text-align:center;"| #83 | style="text-align:center;"| $63,000,000 | style="text-align:center;"| <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=matrix.htm | title=The Matrix (1999) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> |- | ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' | May 15, 2003 | $281,576,462 | $457,023,240 | $742,128,461 | style="text-align:center;"| #39 <br /> #102<small><sup>'''(A)'''</sup></small> | style="text-align:center;"| #35 | style="text-align:center;"| $127,000,000 | style="text-align:center;"| <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=matrixreloaded.htm | title=The Matrix Reloaded (2003) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> |- | ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' | November 5, 2003 | $139,313,948 | $285,674,263 | $427,343,298 | style="text-align:center;"| #220 | style="text-align:center;"| #104 | style="text-align:center;"| $110,000,000 | style="text-align:center;"| <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=matrixrevolutions.htm | title=The Matrix Revolutions (2003) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> |- | colspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|Total | $592,370,340 | $1,031,598,503 | $1,623,968,843 | | | style="text-align:center;"|$300,000,000 |- | colspan="9" | <small>'''List indicator(s)''' * <small><sup>'''(A)'''</sup> indicates the adjusted ranks based on current ticket prices (calculated by [[Box Office Mojo]]).</small> |} ===Critical reaction=== {{Expand section|date=January 2010}} While the first film was extremely successful, both critically and popularly, the quality of the sequels is still a matter of debate.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/matrix_revolutions/ Review of Matrix Revolutions]</ref> ''The Matrix Reloaded'' was well received by critics, though the reaction of some viewers has been mixed.
