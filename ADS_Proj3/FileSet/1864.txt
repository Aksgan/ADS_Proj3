an [[FBI]] investigation into an alleged hacking of conservative political activist group [[Protest Warrior]]. His apartment was raided by the Chicago FBI, and all electronic equipment was seized. The federal government claimed that a select group of HackThisSite hackers gained access to the Protest Warrior user database, procured user credit-card information and conspired to run scripts that would automatically wire money to a slew of non-profit organizations. The plot was uncovered when a hacker said to have been disgruntled with the progress of the activities turned informant.<ref>[http://houston.indymedia.org/news/2005/07/41420_comment.php Hacker Activist Jeremy Hammond Raided by Chicago FBI and Threatened with False Felony Charges]</ref><ref>[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2007/The-Hacktivist/ The Hacktivist]</ref> ===Internal problems=== Administrators, developers,and moderators on HackThisSite are arranged in a democratic but highly anarchical fashion. While this structure appears to work at most times, when disputes arise, loyalties tend to become very confusing. Subsequently, HackThisSite has a long history of administrators,developers, and moderators turning [[Black hat|darkside]] and severely impairing or completely taking down the site.<ref>{{cite web | title=Forums Upgrade 2.1.3 - Take 2, Redone | publisher=CriticalSecurity.NET | url =http://www.criticalsecurity.net/index.php?showtopic=4050 | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Rollback, Database restoration | publisher=CriticalSecurity.NET | url=http://www.criticalsecurity.net/index.php?s=411612728a9b3bb45160b644808908ae&showtopic=1440&st=0 | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> In one incident, and the last major attack to occur, several [[Black hat|blackhat]] [[dissident]]s gained root-level access to the website and proceeded to "[[rm (Unix)|rm -rf]]" the entire site.

These events are typically between several days and a week in length. A hackathon refers not simply to one time hacks, but to a specific time when many people come together to hack on what they want to, how they want to - with little to no restrictions on direction or goal of the programming. The term '''sprint''' is used to describe shorter events of a similar nature, which typically only last a few days. Another name for events of this type, used primarily among [[Linux]] [[user (computing)|users]], is '''codefest''', a combination of the words code and festival, drawing its name from [[installfest]], an event at [[Linux User Group]]s. ==Origins== The term hackathon itself is a [[portmanteau]] formed from the intellectual slang [[Hack (technology slang)|hack]] and -athlon, a part of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]]. The term seems to have been created independently by both the developers of [[OpenBSD]] and the marketing team of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]; these usages both first happened in 1999. OpenBSD's apparent first use of the term referred to a cryptographic development event held in [[Calgary]] on June 4, 1999, where 10 developers came together in order to avoid legal problems caused by export regulations of cryptographic software from the [[United States]]. For Sun, the usage referred to an event at the [[JavaOne]] [[Academic conference|conference]] from June 15 to June 19, 1999; there [[John Gage]] challenged attendees to write a program in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for the new [[Palm V]] using the infrared port to communicate with other Palm users and register it on the Internet. The event was dubbed "the Hackathon". [[Image:connectathon.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Sun microsystems|Sun]] developers at Connectathon 2000]] Sun has also held a number of [[Connectathon]] events since 1986, mostly centered around [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] interoperability. Vendors and other invitees convene during these events to test the interoperability of their hardware and software implementations, identify faults in the specification of Internet standard protocols, and define reusable protocol test suites. Connectathon is more of a developers' conference where participants happen to hack in addition to presenting technical talks to one another, something like the defunct [[MacHack (convention)|MacHack]] conference. ==Current usage== The term hackathon was picked up by [[PHP]] in 2000 for a development event and from there it spread to [[FreeBSD]] in 2001 and [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] during the 2002 ApacheCON. Since its original usage, the hackathon has become more commonly associated with the OpenBSD project than with any other usage. The project holds an annual hackathon in Calgary, Alberta, Canada where as many OpenBSD developers as possible come together to work on the codebase at a more furious pace. The results of these hackathons are usually highly noticeable improvements to either a particular set of tools or hardware platform; such improvements include the radical development [[PF (firewall)|PF]] - which had been started before a hackathon and brought to a much better quality level during the event, expanded support for the [[Sharp Zaurus]], the development of [[OpenBGPd]], improvements to OpenBSD's local CVS system and a large performance improvement to the system through a cleanup of the [[Idle (CPU)|idle]] loop. Companies have recently begun to use the idea of the hackathon, in which they give a day a week or month to workers in order for them to do as they wish development-wise - all results are still owned by the company, but these 'hackathons' allow for employees to escape from their more boring regular tasks and do something that interests them. While other organizations, including [[JotSpot]], [[Atlassian]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] and [[Technorati]], still hold hackathons, few receive the publicity and buzz accorded the annual OpenBSD hackathon. This may in part be due to the frequency and duration of the OpenBSD hackathon when compared to others. Of note with hackathons is that they are not all done simply by inviting developers together - they take a great deal of organizing and have massive financial impact, with [[Theo de Raadt]] noting some cost 20,000 [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] for hotel and equipment fees alone. Because of this, hackathons are limited in the rate at which they occur, happening often only once a year or quarter. They also often seek external sponsors such as in April 2003, when the NLnet Foundation paid for the hotel accommodations for the OpenBSD hackathon, which had recently had its funding project [[POSSE project|POSSE]] canceled prematurely. ==OpenBSD hackathons== [[Image:C2k1.jpg|thumb|280px|[[OpenBSD]] hackers at c2k++, at [[MIT]]]] Since the
