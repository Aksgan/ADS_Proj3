This idea is known as [[Brooks's law]], and is presented along with the [[second-system effect]] and advocacy of [[Software prototyping|prototyping]]. Brooks's observations are based on his experiences at [[IBM]] while managing the development of [[OS/360]]. He had mistakenly added more workers to a project falling behind schedule. He also made the mistake of asserting that one project &mdash; writing an [[Algol programming language|Algol]] [[compiler]] &mdash; would require six months, regardless of the number of workers involved (it required longer). The tendency for managers to repeat such errors in project development led Brooks to quip that his book is called "The Bible of Software Engineering", because, "everybody quotes it, some people read it, and a few people go by it."<!-- NB - "go by" (as in "follow") is correct, not "buy" (as in purchase) --><ref>{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363107/index.htm | title = Quoted Often, Followed Rarely | accessdate = 2010-10-23 | work=CNN | first=Daniel | last=Roth | date=2005-12-12 }}</ref> The book is widely regarded as a classic on the human elements of software engineering.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://grokcode.com/11/the-top-9-in-a-hackers-bookshelf/ | title = The Top 9½ In a Hacker’s Bookshelf | accessdate = 2010-10-23 }}</ref> The work was first published in 1975 (ISBN 0-201-00650-2), reprinted with corrections in 1982, and republished in an anniversary edition with four extra chapters in 1995 (ISBN 0-201-83595-9), including a reprint of the essay "[[No Silver Bullet]]" with commentary by the author. == Ideas presented == === The mythical man-month === Assigning more [[programmers]] to a project running behind schedule will make it even later, because of the time required for the new programmers to learn about the project, as well as the increased communication overhead. When ''N'' people have to communicate among themselves (without a hierarchy), as ''N'' increases, their output ''M'' decreases and can even become negative, ''i.e.'', the total work remaining at the end of a day is greater than the total work that had been remaining at the beginning of that day, such as when many bugs are created. * Group Intercommunication Formula: ''n''(''n'' − 1) / 2 * Example: 50 developers give 50 · (50 – 1) / 2 = 1225 channels of communication. Brooks illustrates the fallacy of adding workers to speed the work by counterexample: If one woman can produce a baby in nine months, then nine women should be able to produce a baby in one month. The reason that this is false is that gestation is a sequential process, whose stages cannot run in parallel. If nine women get pregnant at the same time, in nine months they will produce nine different babies. === The second-system effect === The [[Second-system effect|second system]] is that when an architect designs a second system it is the most dangerous system he will ever design because he will tend to incorporate all of the additions he originated but did not add (because of the inherent time constraints) to the first system. Thus, when embarking upon a second system, an engineer should be mindful that he is susceptible to over-engineering it. === The tendency towards irreducible number of errors === The author makes the observation that in a suitably complex system there is a certain irreducible number of errors. Any attempt to fix observed errors tends to result in the introduction of other errors. === Progress tracking === Brooks wrote "Question: How does a large software project get to be one year late? Answer: One day at a time!" Incremental slippages on many fronts eventually accumulate to produce a large overall delay. Continued attention to meeting small individual milestones is required at each level of management. === Conceptual integrity === To make a user-friendly system, the system must have conceptual integrity, which can only be achieved by separating architecture from implementation. A single chief architect (or a small number of architects), acting on the user's behalf, decides what goes in the system and what stays out. The architect or team of architects should develop an idea of what the system should do and make sure this vision is understood by the rest of the team. A novel idea by someone may not be included if it does not fit seamlessly with the overall system design. In fact, to ensure a user-friendly system, a system may deliberately provide ''fewer'' features than it is capable of. The point is that if a system is too complicated to use, then many of its features will go unused because no one has the time to learn how to use them. === The manual === What the chief architect produces are written specifications for the system in the form of the manual. It should describe the external specifications of the system in detail, ''i.e.'', everything that the user sees. The manual should be altered as feedback comes in from the implementation teams and the users. === The pilot system === When designing a new kind of system, a team ''will'' design a throw-away system (whether it intends to or not). This system acts as a "pilot plant" that reveals techniques that will subsequently cause a complete redesign of the system. This second, ''smarter'' system should be the one delivered to the customer, since delivery of the pilot system would cause nothing but agony to the customer, and possibly ruin the system's reputation and maybe even the company's. === Formal documents === Every project manager should create a small core set of formal documents defining the project objectives, how they are to be achieved, who is going to achieve them, when they are going to be achieved, and how much they are going to cost. These documents may also reveal
