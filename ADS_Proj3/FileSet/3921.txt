(Vince Busam, Michael Todd, Dan Rodriques, Jason Droege and Kevin Smilak) from the Computer Science Department of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]) in [[1997]]. It moved into the spotlight in 1999 when former Disney president [[Michael Ovitz]] bought about a quarter of its shares. The company's nice early products were an [[Server message block|SMB]] search engine and '''Scour Media Agent''', a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] application to download files from SMB shares. The search engine would probe IP addresses for publicly shared files and then index them for download by other users. <!-- commented out deleted image [[File:sma.jpg|thumb|right|Scour Media Agent]] --> In [[1998]], the company developed a web [[search engine]] as well, [[Web crawler|crawling]] the [[World Wide Web]] for links to multimedia audio, video and images. In [[1999]] Scour received an investment from [[Michael Ovitz]] and the [[Yucaipa Company]], an investment arm of the billionaire [[Ronald Burkle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB928970934179363266.html|title=Ovitz, Yucaipa Buy Majority Stake In Entertainment Search Engine|last=Orwall|first=Bruce|date=June 10, 1999|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Together, the total investment represented a controlling share in the company. After the investment, Scour expanded in terms of product offerings and personnel. The company launched a software product named [[MyCaster]] which allowed users to stream audio over the network, optionally mixing microphone input with an [[MP3]] audio file in real time. Faced with the increasing popularity of [[Napster]], Scour developed a competing peer-to-peer service named Scour Exchange.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E2D9113AF931A15756C0A9669C8B63|title=Agent's Role In Music Site May Be Shift In Rights War|last=Richtel|first=Matt|date=May 22, 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Unlike Napster, the Scour software supported video and images in addition to just audio files, and integrated all users into one network. The company also tied its web site promotional materials to the Scour Exchange software and attempted to leverage its web and SMB indexes in providing additional search results inside the Scour Exchange application. In the summer of [[2000]] the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[National Music Publishers Association]] (NMPA) brought a lawsuit against Scour, alleging copyright infringement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7DF173AF932A15754C0A9669C8B63|title=Movie and Record Companies Sue a Film Trading Site|last=Richtel|first=Matt|date=July 21, 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Despite Scour's declarations of innocence, the company was not able to raise money to continue operations.

Scour rewards users with a point for each unique search conducted through the Scour Toolbar or at the website, as well as for commenting or rating a result (to a maximum of three points per search). Points can also be acquired through use of its [[affiliate program]], with a matching 25% commission given to the host of the referral. Once users have accumulated a certain amount of points they can be redeemed for a [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] [[gift card]] or [[PayPal]] [[money transfer]]<ref>http://scour.com/learnmore/</ref> at an implied [[exchange rate]] of approximately [[United States Dollar|USD$]]0.004 (2/5¢) a point<!-- The FAQ lists three options.

Original student founders of Scour.com (Vince Busam, Michael Todd, Dan Rodriques, Jason Droege and Kevin Smilakare; UCLA 1997) are believed to be responsible for the virus redirects to their site. Legal action against scour.com is being solicited from users who's computers were infected with the student's virus. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.scour.com/ Scour] [[Category:File sharing networks]] [[Category:Internet search engines]] [[Category:Pay per click search engines]] [[Category:Social search]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33439</id> <title>Screenless</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} '''Screenless''' video describes systems for transmitting visual information from a video source without the use of a [[computer display|screen]]. Screenless computing systems can be divided into three groups: Visual Image, [[Retina]]l Direct, and [[Chemical synapse|Synaptic]] Interface. == Visual image == Visual Image screenless display includes any screenless image that the eye can perceive. The most common example of Visual Image screenless display is a [[hologram]]. Arguably, virtual reality goggles (which consist of two small screens but are nonetheless sufficiently different from traditional computer screens to be considered screenless) and [[head-up display|heads-up display]] in jet fighters (which display images on the clear cockpit window) also are included in Visual Image category. In all of these cases, light is reflected off some intermediate object (hologram, LCD panel, or cockpit window) before it reaches the retina. In the case of LCD panels the light is refracted from the back of the panel, but is nonetheless a reflected source. == Retinal display == [[Virtual retinal display]] systems are a class of screenless displays in which images are projected directly onto the [[retina]]. They are distinguished from visual image systems because light is not [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] from some intermediate object onto the retina, it is instead projected directly onto the retina. Retinal Direct systems, once marketed, hold out the promise of extreme privacy when computing work is done in public places because most snooping relies on viewing the same light as the person who is legitimately viewing the screen, and retinal direct systems send light only into the pupils of their intended viewer. == Synaptic interface == Synaptic Interface screenless video does not use light at all. Visual information completely bypasses the eye and is transmitted [[Brain–computer interface|directly to the brain]]. While such systems have yet to be
