are often incorrectly referred to as the basis functions of the (continuous) transform. In fact, as in the continuous Fourier transform, there is no basis in the continuous wavelet transform. Time-frequency interpretation uses a subtly different formulation (after Delprat). == Comparisons with Fourier transform (continuous-time) == The wavelet transform is often compared with the [[Fourier transform]], in which signals are represented as a sum of sinusoids. The main difference is that wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard [[Fourier transform]] is only localized in [[frequency]]. The [[Short-time Fourier transform]] (STFT) is more similar to the wavelet transform, in that it is also time and frequency localized, but there are issues with the frequency/time resolution trade-off. Wavelets often give a better signal representation using [[Multiresolution analysis]], with balanced resolution at any time and frequency. The discrete wavelet transform is also less computationally [[complexity|complex]], taking [[Big O notation|O(''N'')]] time as compared to O(''N'' log ''N'') for the [[fast Fourier transform]]. This computational advantage is not inherent to the transform, but reflects the choice of a logarithmic division of frequency, in contrast to the equally spaced frequency divisions of the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It is also important to note that this complexity only applies when the filter size has no relation to the signal size. A wavelet without [[compact support]] such as the [[Shannon wavelet]] would require O(''N^2''). (For instance, a logarithmic Fourier Transform also exists with O(''N'') complexity, but the original signal must be sampled logarithmically in time, which is only useful for certain types of signals.<ref>http://homepages.dias.ie/~ajones/papers/28.pdf</ref>) == Definition of a wavelet == There are a number of ways of defining a wavelet (or a wavelet family). === Scaling filter === An orthogonal wavelet is entirely defined by the scaling filter - a low-pass [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filter of length ''2N'' and sum 1. In [[Biorthogonal system|biorthogonal]] wavelets, separate decomposition and reconstruction filters are defined. For analysis with orthogonal wavelets the high pass filter is calculated as the [[quadrature mirror filter]] of the low pass, and reconstruction filters are the time reverse of the decomposition filters. Daubechies and Symlet wavelets can be defined by the scaling filter. === Scaling function === Wavelets are defined by the wavelet function <math>\psi (t)</math> (i.e. the mother wavelet) and scaling function <math>\phi (t)</math> (also called father wavelet) in the time domain. The wavelet function is in effect a band-pass filter and scaling it for each level halves its bandwidth. This creates the problem that in order to cover the entire spectrum, an infinite number of levels would be required. The scaling function filters the lowest level of the transform and ensures all the spectrum is covered. See [http://perso.wanadoo.fr/polyvalens/clemens/wavelets/wavelets.html#section7] for a detailed explanation. For a wavelet with compact support, <math>\phi (t)</math> can be considered finite in length and is equivalent to the scaling filter ''g''. Meyer wavelets can be defined by scaling functions === Wavelet function === The wavelet only has a time domain representation as the wavelet function <math>\psi (t)</math>. For instance, [[Mexican hat wavelet]]s can be defined by a wavelet function. See a list of a few [[Continuous wavelets]]. == Applications of discrete wavelet transform== Generally, an approximation to DWT is used for [[data compression]] if signal is already sampled, and the CWT for [[signal analysis]]. Thus, DWT approximation is commonly used in engineering and computer science, and the CWT in scientific research. Wavelet transforms are now being adopted for a vast number of applications, often replacing the conventional [[Fourier Transform]]. Many areas of physics have seen this paradigm shift, including [[molecular dynamics]], [[ab initio]] calculations, [[astrophysics]], [[Density matrix|density-matrix]] localisation, [[seismology]], [[optics]], [[turbulence]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. This change has also occurred in [[image processing]], blood-pressure, heart-rate and [[ECG]] analyses, [[DNA]] analysis, [[protein]] analysis, [[climatology]], general [[signal processing]], [[speech recognition]], [[computer graphics]] and [[multifractal analysis]]. In [[computer vision]] and [[image processing]], the notion of [[scale-space]] representation and Gaussian derivative operators is regarded as a canonical multi-scale representation. One use of wavelet approximation is in data compression. Like some other transforms, wavelet transforms can be used to transform data, then encode the transformed data, resulting in effective compression. For example, [[JPEG 2000]] is an image compression standard that uses biorthogonal wavelets. This means that although the frame is overcomplete, it is a ''tight frame'' (see types of [[Frame of a vector space]]), and the same frame functions (except for conjugation in the case of complex wavelets) are used for both analysis and synthesis, i.e., in both the forward and inverse transform. For details see [[wavelet compression]]. A related use is that of smoothing/denoising data based on wavelet coefficient thresholding, also called wavelet shrinkage. By adaptively thresholding the wavelet coefficients that correspond to undesired frequency components smoothing and/or denoising operations can be performed. Wavelet transforms are also starting to be used for communication applications. Wavelet OFDM is the basic modulation scheme used in HD-PLC (a powerline communications technology developed by [[Panasonic]]), and in one of the optional modes included in the [[IEEE P1901]] draft standard. The advantage of Wavelet [[OFDM]] over traditional [[FFT]] [[OFDM]] systems is that Wavelet can achieve deeper notches and that it does not require a Guard Interval (which usually represents significant overhead in FFT OFDM systems)<ref name="galli">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4557044 Recent Developments in the Standardization of Power Line Communications within the IEEE], (Galli, S. and Logvinov, O - IEEE Communications Magazine, July 2008)</ref>. == History == The development of wavelets can be linked to several separate trains of thought, starting with [[Alfred Haar|Haar]]'s work in the early 20th century. Notable contributions to wavelet theory can be attributed to [[George Zweig|Zweig]]’s discovery of the continuous wavelet transform in 1975 (originally called the cochlear transform and discovered while studying the reaction of the ear to sound)<ref>http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Zweig.html Zweig, George Biography on Scienceworld.wolfram.com</ref>, Pierre Goupillaud, [[Alex Grossman|Grossmann]] and [[Jean Morlet|Morlet]]'s formulation of what is now known as the CWT (1982), Jan-Olov Strömberg's early work on discrete wavelets (1983), [[Ingrid Daubechies|Daubechies]]' orthogonal wavelets with compact support (1988), [[Stephane Mallat|Mallat]]'s multiresolution framework (1989), Nathalie Delprat's
