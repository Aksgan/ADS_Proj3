Under the identification of a [[circle]] with '''R'''/'''Z''', or with the interval [0, 1] with the boundary points glued together, this map becomes a [[rotation]] of a [[circle]] by a proportion ''&theta;'' of a full revolution (i.e. an angle of 2''&pi;θ'' radians). Since ''&theta;'' is irrational, the rotation has infinite [[Order (group theory)|order]] in the [[circle group]] and the map ''T''<sub>''&theta;''</sub> has no [[periodic orbit]]s. Moreover, the orbit of any point ''x'' under the [[iterated function|iterates]] of ''T''<sub>''&theta;''</sub>, :<math>\{x+n \theta : n \in \mathbb{Z}\},</math> is [[dense set|dense]] in the interval [0, 1) or the circle. == Significance == Irrational rotations form a fundamental example in the theory of [[dynamical system]]s. According to the [[Denjoy theorem]], every orientation-preserving ''C''<sup>2</sup>-diffeomorphism of the circle with an irrational [[rotation number]] ''&theta;'' is [[topologically conjugate]] to ''T''<sub>''&theta;''</sub>. An irrational rotation is a [[measure-preserving transformation|measure-preserving]] [[ergodic transformation]], but it is not [[mixing (physics)|mixing]]. The [[Poincaré map]] for the dynamical system associated with the [[Foliation#Examples|Kronecker foliation]] on a [[torus]] with angle ''θ'' is the irrational rotation by ''θ''. [[C*-algebra]]s associated with irrational rotations, known as [[irrational rotation algebra]]s, have been extensively studied. ==See also== *[[Bernoulli map]] *[[Modular arithmetic]] *[[Toeplitz algebra]] == References == * C.E.Silva, ''Invitation to ergodic theory'', Student Mathematical Library, vol 42, [[American Mathematical Society]], 2008 ISBN 978-0-8218-4420-5 [[Category:Dynamical systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19372</id> <title>Irreducible Mind</title> <text>'''''Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century''''' is a 2007 book by Edward F.
