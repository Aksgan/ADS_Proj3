the virtual memory &mdash; the total amount of data the computer can keep in its working area &mdash; is determined by the width of these registers. Beginning in the 1960s with the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] (which was an exception, in that it used the low order 24 bits of a word for addresses, resulting in a 16 [[megabyte|MB]] [{{nowrap|16 × 1024<sup>2</sup> bytes}}] address space size), then (amongst many others) the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]] minicomputer in the 1970s, and then with the [[Intel 80386]] in the mid-1980s, a ''de facto'' consensus developed that 32 bits was a convenient register size. A 32-bit [[address register]] meant that 2<sup>32</sup> addresses, or 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], could be referenced. At the time these architectures were devised, 4 GB of memory was so far beyond the typical quantities (4 MB) in installations that this was considered to be enough "headroom" for addressing. 4.29 billion addresses were considered an appropriate size to work with for another important reason: 4.29 billion integers are enough to assign unique references to most entities in applications like [[database]]s. Some [[supercomputer]] architectures of the 1970s and 1980s used registers up to 64 bits wide. In the mid-1980s, Intel i860<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/38.31467 |title=The Intel i860 64-Bit Processor: A General-Purpose CPU with 3D Graphics Capabilities |date=July/August 1989 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=85–94|first=Jack |last=Grimes |first2=Les |last2=Kohn |first3=Rajeev |last3=Bharadhwaj|work=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> development began culminating in a (too late<ref>Zachary, ''Showstopper!''</ref> for Windows NT) 1989 release. However, 32 bits remained the norm until the early 1990s, when the continual reductions in the cost of memory led to installations with quantities of RAM approaching 4 GB, and the use of virtual memory spaces exceeding the 4 GB ceiling became desirable for handling certain types of problems. In response, MIPS and DEC developed 64-bit microprocessor architectures, initially for high-end [[workstation]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] machines. By the mid-1990s, [[HAL Computer Systems]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[IBM]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Hewlett Packard]] had developed 64-bit architectures for their workstation and server systems. A notable exception to this trend were [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] from IBM, which then used 32-bit data and 31-bit address sizes; the IBM mainframes did not include 64-bit processors until 2000. During the 1990s, several low-cost 64-bit microprocessors were used in consumer electronics and embedded applications. Notably, the [[Nintendo 64]]<ref>{{cite press release|title=NEC Offers Two High Cost Performance 64-bit RISC Microprocessors|publisher=[[NEC]]|date=1998-01-20|url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/9801/2002.htm|accessdate=2011-01-09|quote=Versions of the VR4300 processor are widely used in consumer and office automation applications, including the popular Nintendo 64TM video game and advanced laser printers such as the recently announced, award-winning Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4000 printer family.}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 2]] had 64-bit microprocessors before their introduction in personal computers. High-end printers and network equipment, as well as industrial computers also used 64-bit microprocessors such as the [[Quantum Effect Devices]] [[R5000]]. 64-bit computing started to drift down to the personal computer desktop from 2003 onwards, when some models in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s Macintosh lines switched to [[PowerPC 970]] processors (termed "G5" by Apple) and the launch of [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s 64-bit [[x86-64]] extension to the [[x86]] architecture, itself a response to [[Intel]]'s [[Itanium]] gaining early [[operating system]]s support. ==Limitations== {{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}} Most 64-bit microprocessors on the market today have an artificial limit on the amount of memory they can address, considerably lower than what might be expected from 64 bits. For example, the [[x86-64|AMD64 architecture]] currently has a 52 bit limit on physical memory and only supports a 48-bit virtual address space.<ref>AMD64 Programmer's Manual Volume 2: System Programming, order number 24593, revision 3.14, September 2007, Advanced Micro Devices</ref> This is 4 [[petabyte|PB]] ({{nowrap|4 × 1024<sup>5</sup> bytes}}) and 256 [[terabyte|TB]] ({{nowrap|256 × 1024<sup>4</sup> bytes}}), respectively. A PC cannot contain 4 petabytes of memory (due to the size of current memory chips if nothing else) but AMD envisioned large servers, shared memory clusters, and other uses of physical address space that might approach this in the foreseeable future, and the 52 bit physical address provides ample room for expansion while not incurring the cost of implementing 64-bit physical addresses. Similarly, the 48-bit virtual address space was designed to provide more than 65,000 times the 32 bit limit of 4 [[gigabyte|GB]] ({{nowrap|4 × 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes}}), allowing ample room for expansion in the near future without incurring the overhead of translating full 64-bit addresses. ==64-bit processor timeline== ;1961: IBM delivers the [[IBM 7030 Stretch]] [[supercomputer]], which uses 64-bit data words and 32- or 64-bit instruction words. ;1974: [[Control Data Corporation]] launches the [[CDC Star-100]] vector supercomputer, which uses a 64-bit word architecture (previous CDC systems were based on a 60-bit architecture). :[[International Computers Limited]] launches the [[ICL 2900 Series]] with 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit [[two's complement]] integers; 64-bit and 128-bit floating point; 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit packed decimal and a 128-bit accumulator register.
