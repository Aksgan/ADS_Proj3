Adopting the policy that the colonies should pay an increased proportion of the costs associated with keeping them in the Empire, Britain imposed a [[Stamp Act 1765|series of direct taxes]] followed by [[Intolerable Acts|other laws]] intended to demonstrate British authority, all of which proved extremely unpopular in America. Because [[No taxation without representation|the colonies lacked elected representation]] in the governing British Parliament, [[Sons of Liberty|many colonists]] considered the laws to be illegitimate and a violation of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]]. In 1772, groups of colonists began to create ''[[Committee of correspondence|Committees of Correspondence]]'', which would lead to their own Provincial Congresses in most of the colonies. In the course of two years, the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents rejected the Parliament and effectively replaced the British ruling apparatus in the former colonies, culminating in 1774 with the coordinating [[First Continental Congress]].<ref>Brinkley, ''The Sparck of Rebellion'' (2010)</ref> In response to protests in [[Boston]] over Parliament's attempts to assert authority, the British sent combat troops, [[Dissolution (law)|dissolved]] local governments, and imposed direct rule by Royal officials. Consequently, the Colonies mobilized their [[Militia (United States)|militias]], and fighting broke out in 1775. First ostensibly loyal to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], the repeated [[Olive Branch Petition|pleas]] by the First Continental Congress for royal intervention on their behalf with Parliament resulted in the [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declaration by the King]] that the states were "in rebellion", and the members of Congress were [[Treason|traitors]]. In 1776, representatives from each of the original thirteen states voted unanimously in the Second Continental Congress to adopt a Declaration of Independence, which now rejected the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]] in addition to its Parliament. The Declaration established the United States, which was originally governed as a loose confederation through a [[representative democracy]] selected by state legislatures (see ''[[Second Continental Congress]]'' and ''[[Congress of the Confederation]]''). ====Ideology behind the Revolution==== [[File:J S Copley - Samuel Adams.jpg|thumb|alt=A stern middle-aged man with gray hair is wearing a dark red suit.

Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of liberalism, democracy, republicanism, and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. Collectively, the belief in these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity. [[John Locke]]'s (1632–1704) ideas on liberty greatly influenced the political thinking behind the revolution. John Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government]], published in 1689, influenced the thinking of later philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), as reflected in Rousseau's 1762 treatise entitled ''[[The Social Contract|Du contrat social]]''. The theory of the "[[social contract]]" influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the "natural rights" of man was the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to overthrow their leaders]], should those leaders betray the historic [[rights of Englishmen]].<ref>Wraight, ''Rousseau's The Social Contract'' (2008)</ref><ref name=Toth1989>Charles W.

A motivating force behind the revolution was the American embrace of a political ideology called "republicanism", which was dominant in the colonies by 1775. The republicanism was inspired by the "[[Whig (British political party)|country party]]" in Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized that [[political corruption|corruption]] was a terrible reality in Britain.<ref>name= Weintraub2005>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) chapter 1</ref> Americans feared the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights, energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests.
