The IJG is arguably one of the important early open source groups and a major reason why the JPEG image format is a standard. {{Cquote|Probably the largest and most important contribution however was the work of the Independent JPEG Group (IJG), and Tom Lane in particular. Their Open Source software implementation, as well as being one of the major Open Source packages was key to the success of the JPEG standard and was incorporated by many companies into a variety of products such as image editors and Internet browsers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg/index.html|title=JPEG.org Homepage|author=|date=2008-09-14|accessdate=}} (www.jpeg.org)</ref>}} The IJG develops and maintains [[libjpeg]], a library written entirely in C which contains a widely-used implementation of a JPEG decoder, JPEG encoder and other JPEG utilities. ==PNG== The original specification for the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG), version 1.0, was written by Thomas Boutell and Tom Lane, with contributions by many others. Tom Lane is a Contributing Editor for PNG Specification, Version 1.1. ==TIFF== Tom Lane is a member of the [[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF) advisory committee. ==Works== * [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/part1/preamble.html Thomas G.
