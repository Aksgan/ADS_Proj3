of elements of the same type may form an object of the next higher type. Comprehension is schematic with respect to <math>\Phi(x)</math> as well as to types. * '''[[Axiom of infinity|Infinity]]'''. There exists a nonempty [[binary relation]] <math>R</math> over the individuals of the lowest type, that is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], and strongly connected: <math>\forall x,y [x\neq y\rightarrow[xRy\vee yRx]]</math>. : ''Remark''. Infinity is the only true axiom of '''ST''' and is entirely mathematical in nature. It asserts that <math>R</math> is a strict [[total order]], with a [[relation (mathematics)|domain]] identical to its [[relation (mathematics)|codomain]]. If 0 is assigned to the lowest type, the type of <math>R</math> is 3. Infinity can be satisfied only if the (co)domain of <math>R</math> is [[infinite]], thus forcing the existence of an infinite set. If relations are defined in terms of [[ordered pair]]s, this axiom requires a prior definition of ordered pair; the Kuratowski definition, adapted to '''ST''', will do. The literature does not explain why the usual [[axiom of infinity]] (there exists an [[inductive set (axiom of infinity)|inductive set]]) of [[ZFC]] of other set theories could not be married to '''ST'''. '''ST''' reveals how type theory can be made very similar to [[axiomatic set theory]]. Moreover, the more elaborate [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of '''ST''', grounded in what is now called the "iterative conception of set," makes for axiom (schemata) that are far simpler than those of conventional set theories, such as [[ZFC]], with simpler ontologies. Set theories whose point of departure is type theory, but whose axioms, [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]], and terminology differ from the above, include [[New Foundations]] and [[Scott&ndash;Potter set theory]]. === Formulations based on equality === {{See also|simply typed lambda calculus}}<!-- this should really be "main", but that article needs some work too to connect with this --> {{Expand section|date=September 2009}} Church’s type theory has been extensively studied by two of Church’s students, [[Leon Henkin]] and [[Peter B. Andrews (mathematician)|Peter B. Andrews]]. Since '''ST''' is a [[higher order logic]], and in higher order logics one can define propositional connectives in terms of [[logical equivalence]] and quantifiers, in 1963 Henkin developed a formulation of '''ST''' based on equality, but in which he restricted attention to propositional types. This was simplified later that year by Andrews in his [[Q zero|theory '''Q<sub>0</sub>''']].<!--does anyone else call it this way? --><ref>[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/ Church's Type Theory]" &ndash; by Peter Andrews (adapted from his book).</ref> In this respect '''ST''' can be seen as a particular kind of a higher-order logic, classified by [[P.T. Johnstone]] in ''Sketches of an Elephant'', as having a [[lambda-signature]], that is a higher-order [[signature (logic)|signature]] that contains no relations, and uses only products and arrows (function types) as [[type constructors]]. Furthermore, as Johnstone put it, '''ST''' is "logic-free" in the sense that it contains no logical connectives or quantifiers in its formulae.<ref>P.T.

Frege promptly responded, acknowledging the problem and proposing a solution in a technical discussion of "levels". To quote Frege: "Incidentally, it seems to me that the expression "a [[predicate]] is predicated of itself" is not exact. A predicate is as a rule a first-level function, and this function requires an object as argument and cannot have itself as argument (subject). Therefore I would prefer to say "a concept is predicated of its own extension"<ref>Frege (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' appears, with commentary, in van Heijenoort 1967:126-128.</ref>. He goes about showing how this might work but seems to pull back from it. (In a footnote, van Heijenoort notes that in Frege ''1893'' Frege had used a symbol (horseshoe) "for reducing second-level functions to first-level functions"<ref>van Hiejenoort 1967:128</ref>). As a consequence of what has become known as [[Russell's paradox]] both Frege and Russell had to quickly emend works that they had at the printers. In an Appendix B that Russell tacked on to his 1903 [[Principles of Mathematics]] one finds his "tentative" "theory of types"<ref>cf Quine's commentary before Russell (1908a) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:150</ref>. The matter plagued Russell for about five years (1903–1908). [[Willard Quine]] in his preface to Russell's (1908a) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''<ref>cf commentary by W. V. O. Quine before Russell's (1908a) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:150-153</ref> presents a historical synopsis of the origin of the theory of types and the "ramified" theory of types: Russell proposed in turn a number of alternatives: (i) abandoning the theory of types (1905) followed by three theories in 1905: (ii.1) the zigzag theory, (ii.2) theory of limitation of size, (ii.3) the no-class theory (1905–1906), then (iii) readopting the theory of types (1908ff)". Quine observes that Russell's introduction of the notion of "[[apparent variable]]" had the following result: "the distinction between 'all' and 'any': 'all' is expressed by the bound ('apparent') variable of universal quantification, which ranges over a type, and 'any' is expressed by the free ('real') variable which refers schematically to any unspecified thing irrespective of type". Quine dismisses this notion of "bound variable" as "pointless apart from a certain aspect of the theory of types"<ref>Quine's commentary before Russell (1908a) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' cf van Heijenoort 1967:151</ref>. ==== The 1908 "ramified" theory of types ==== Quine explains the ''ramified'' theory as follows: "It has been so called because the type of a function depends both on the types of its arguments and on the types of the apparent variables contained in it (or in its expresion), in case these exceed the types of the arguments"<ref>Quine's commentary commentary before Russell (1908a) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of
