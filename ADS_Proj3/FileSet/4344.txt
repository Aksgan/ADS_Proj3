TM1 is ''IBM Cognos TM1 Web,'' which enables business users to develop and publish web-based applications, using [[Microsoft Excel]] as an authoring medium. IBM Cognos TM1 Web is developed in [[ASP.NET]], and is compatible with [[Microsoft Internet Explorer]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]]. With its flagship TM1 product line, Applix was the purest OLAP vendor among publicly traded independent BI vendors prior to OLAP industry consolidation in 2007, and had the greatest growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title= Consolidations in the BI industry |author= Nigel Pendse |date= 2008-03-07 |work=The BI Verdict (The OLAP Report) | accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/Comment_OLAP_revival.htm |title= Commentary: The OLAP Revival |author= Carsten Bange |date= 2008-11-14 |work= The BI Verdict (The OLAP Report) | accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref> The latest version, IBM Cognos TM1 9.5, became publicly available on February 9, 2010. == References == {{reflist}} == See also == * [[Business intelligence]] * [[Comparison of OLAP Servers]] ==External links== *[http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=2492125 TM1 Specialists.

It can be used to study topics such as [[ozone depletion]] and [[tropospheric pollution]], and was one of the models used the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere [http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=50]. It incorporates a choice of detailed chemistry schemes for the troposphere or stratosphere, and an optional chemical [[data assimilation]] scheme. The original model code, called the Toulouse Off-line Model of Chemistry And Transport (TOMCAT), was written by Martyn Chipperfield at [[Météo France]]. "Off-line" in this sense describes the fact that although the meteorological data (wind components and other fields) which are used as input to the CTM typically derive from a [[general circulation model]] (GCM), the CTM is run as a separate program outside of a GCM; this is as distinct from a chemistry simulation scheme which runs within a GCM, in which the simulated chemical distributions, e.g. of [[ozone]], can provide feedback on the meteorology via the GCM's radiation scheme. A version called the Single Layer Isentropic Model of Chemistry And Transport (SLIMCAT) was developed in 1995. This used a level of constant [[potential temperature]] (or equivalently, of constant specific [[entropy]], hence ''isentropic''), exploiting the fact that due to approximate conservation of energy, atmospheric motions are approximately [[adiabatic]] and hence air parcels remain on isentropic levels on short timescales. A diabatic heating scheme was later added, to allow for multiple isentropic levels with transport between them on longer timescales, although the name "SLIMCAT" has remained despite the multiple levels. The two programs are now maintained as a single code base, which runs in [[Fortran]], and has been parallelised. TOMCAT has been further extended to include a detailed treatment of [[aerosol]]. GLOMAP (Global Model of Aerosol Processes) simulates a wide range of aerosol species including [[black carbon]], [[sulfate]], sea spray, soil dust, and secondary organic aerosol. The primary purpose of TOMCAT/GLOMAP is to simulate aerosol [[radiative forcing]] and the impact of aerosol on climate. == References == * Chipperfield, M.P., New Version of the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT Off-Line Chemical Transport Model: Intercomparison of Stratospheric Tracer Experiments, ''Q.

The official definition and creation is provided by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) as follows: :'''''[[IEEE 829]] - Test Procedure Specification''''' :''The Test Procedures are developed from both the Test Design and the Test Case Specification. The document describes how the tester will physically run the test, the physical set-up required, and the procedure steps that need to be followed.
