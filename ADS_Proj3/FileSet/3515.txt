It uses a set of 'conduits' for the exchange of information from different Palm applications. pilot-link provides [[command line]] tools to perform synchronisation tasks, such as the pilot-xfer command, which can install the standard Palm database ([[PDB (Palm OS)|PDB]]) files to the connected device. [[Graphical User Interface]]s for the pilot-link software include [[KPilot]], part of the [[KDE]]'s [[kdepim|Personal Information Management]] applications, and [[JPilot]], a [[GTK+]]-based interface. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.pilot-link.org/ Pilot-link community home page]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}} *{{sourceforge|pilot-link}} *[http://cvs.codeyard.net/kpilot/ KPilot home page] *[http://www.jpilot.org/requirements.html JPilot] {{DEFAULTSORT:Pilot-link}} [[Category:Embedded operating systems]] [[Category:Mobile operating systems]] [[Category:Palm OS| ]] [[Category:Personal digital assistants]] [Category:Computer libraries| ]] [[Category:Operating system technology]] {{unix-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>29271</id> <title>Pimp My Search</title> <text>'''Pimp My Search''' was a novelty website to create a [[Google]] lookalike webpage, replacing the word "Google" with a word or phrase of the user's choice.<ref>{{cite web | author=Bennett, Geoffrey | title=Has Google Finally Met Its Match? | url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/newsandviews/2008/05/has_google_finally_met_its_mat.html | work=[[NPR]] | publisher= | date=2008-05-14 | accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Gill, Ronnie | title=Pimpmysearch.com offers a Google-like Web site | url=http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/monday/partii/ny-lshow5833924sep08a,0,4325335.story | work=[[Newsday]] | publisher= | date=2008-09-08 | accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> It is a non-commercial website and is not connected to Google, Inc.{{Fact|date=May 2009}} Pimp My Search was started in 2006, but became popular only in 2008 after featured in many media websites and [[YouTube]] videos.{{Fact|date=May 2009}} The site was closed down later in 2009, citing a dispute over 'trademark issues'. ==Controversies with Google== In February 2009, Pimp my Search ended Google search facilities and a posted a message that read: "Because of Trademark issues Google is no longer allowing searches from us...".<ref>http://www.pimpmysearch.com/problem.php?q= Retrieved on 2009-05-25.</ref> Currently, the site remains closed, with the following message displayed: "Because of Trademark issues Pimp my Search is closed for ever". == References == <references/> [[Category:Web services]] [[Category:Web service providers]] [[Category:Internet search engines]] [[Category:Internet culture]] [[Category:Google]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2006]] {{web-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>29274</id> <title>Ping</title> <text>{{About|the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] network utility|the social network|iTunes Ping|other uses|Ping (disambiguation)}} '''Ping''' is a [[computer network]] administration utility used to test the reachability of a [[Host (network)|host]] on an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network and to measure the [[round-trip time]] for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer. The name comes from [[Sonar#Active sonar|active sonar]] terminology. ''Ping'' operates by sending [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) ''echo request'' [[packet (information technology)|packets]] to the target host and waiting for an ICMP response. In the process it measures the time from transmission to reception (''round-trip time'')<ref name=ping /> and records any [[packet loss]]. The results of the test are printed in form of a statistical summary of the response packets received, including the minimum, maximum, and the [[average|mean]] round-trip times, and sometimes the [[standard deviation]] of the mean. ''Ping'' may be run using various options (command line switches) depending on the implementation that enable special operational modes, such as to specify the packet size used as the probe, automatic repeated operation for sending a specified count of probes, time stamping options, or to perform a [[ping flood]]. Flood pinging may be abused as a simple form of [[denial-of-service attack]], in which the attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP echo request packets. ==History== The ping utility was authored by [[Mike Muuss]] in December 1983 as a tool to troubleshoot problems in an IP network. He named it after the sound pulses of active [[sonar]], which also involves sending a signal and measuring the time until any echo is received.<ref name=ping>{{cite web | author = Mike Muuss | authorlink = Mike Muuss | title=The Story of the PING Program | url=http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5saCKBpgH | publisher = U.S. Army Research Laboratory | location = Adelphi, MD, USA | archivedate = 08 September 2010 | accessdate = 08 September 2010 | quote = I named it after the sound that a sonar makes, inspired by the whole principle of echo-location. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Salus |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Salus |title=A Quarter Century of UNIX |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |year=1994 |isbn=0201547775 }}</ref> The usefulness of ''ping'' in assisting the diagnosis of Internet connectivity issues was impaired starting in 2003, when a number of [[Internet service provider]]s began filtering out ICMP Type 8 ([[ICMP Echo Request]]) messages at their network boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This was partly due to the increasing use of ping for target reconnaissance, for example by [[Computer worm|Internet worms]] such as [[Welchia]] that flood the Internet with ping requests in order to locate new [[computer]]s to infect. Not only did the availability of ping responses leak information to an attacker, it added to the overall load on networks, causing problems for [[router]]s across the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} However ''host discovery'' or ''ping scanning'' or ''[[ping sweep]]'' is still a part of [[Network scanner|network scanning]] tools like [[nmap]], as it may give basic evidence about the existence of a remote machine. Although RFC 1122 prescribes that any host must accept an echo-request and issue an echo-reply in return, this has been characterized as a security risk.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 |title=Shields Up, Firewall Test.
