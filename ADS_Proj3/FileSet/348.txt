a network of processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network.<ref>Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 78</ref></p> <p>[...] the space defined by an autopoietic system is self-contained and cannot be described by using dimensions that define another space. When we refer to our interactions with a concrete autopoietic system, however, we project this system on the space of our manipulations and make a description of this projection.<ref>Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 89</ref></p></blockquote> The term ''autopoiesis'' was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of [[living systems]]. A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the [[biological cell]]. The [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell, for example, is made of various biochemical components such as [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s, and is organized into bounded structures such as the [[cell nucleus]], various [[organelle]]s, a [[cell membrane]] and [[cytoskeleton]]. These structures, based on an external flow of molecules and energy, ''produce'' the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components. An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an [[allopoietic]] system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something ''other'' than itself (the factory). Even though others have often used the term as a synonym for [[self-organization]], Maturana himself stated he would "never use the notion of self-organization, because it cannot be the case ... it is impossible. That is, if the organization of a thing changes, the thing changes."<ref>Maturana, H. (1987). Everything is said by an observer. In Gaia, a Way of Knowing, edited by W. Thompson,. Lindisfarne Press, Great Barrington, MA, pp. 65-82, p. 71.</ref> Moreover, an autopoietic system is autonomous and operationally closed, in the sense that there are sufficient processes within it to maintain the whole. Autopoietic systems are "structurally coupled" with their medium, embedded in a dynamic of changes that can be recalled as [[sensory-motor coupling]]. This continuous dynamic is considered as at least a rudimentary form of [[knowledge]] or [[cognition]] and can be observed throughout life-forms. An application of the concept to [[sociology]] can be found in [[Niklas Luhmann#Theory|Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Systems theory#Sociology and Sociocybernetics|Systems Theory]], which was subsequently adapted by [[Bob Jessop]] in his studies of the capitalist state system. [[Marjatta Maula]] adapted the concept of autopoiesis in a business context. ==Criticism== Criticism of the use of the term in both its original use, as an attempt to define and explain the living, and its various expanded usages such as applying it to self-organizing systems in general, or social systems, in particular have been widespread.<ref>Fleischaker, G. (Ed.) (1992). Autopoiesis in Systems Analysis: A Debate. Int. J. General Systems, Vol. 21, No 2, pp. 131-271</ref> Critics have argued that the term fails to define or explain living systems and that, because of the extreme language of [[self-referential]]ity it uses without any external reference, it is really an attempt to give substantiation to Maturana's radical [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] or [[solipsistic]] [[epistemology]]<ref>Swenson, R.
