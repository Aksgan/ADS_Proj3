For example, biological activity can be expressed quantitatively as in the concentration of a substance required to give a certain biological response. Additionally, when physicochemical properties or structures are expressed by numbers, one can form a mathematical relationship, or quantitative structure-activity relationship, between the two. The mathematical expression can then be used to predict the biological response of other chemical structures. QSAR's most general mathematical form is: * <math>\;\text{Activity} = f(\text{physiochemical properties and/or structural properties})</math> == SAR and the SAR paradox == The basic assumption for all molecule based [[hypotheses]] is that similar molecules have similar activities. This principle is also called '''S'''tructure-'''A'''ctivity '''R'''elationship ([[Structure-activity relationship|SAR]]). The underlying problem is therefore how to define a ''small'' difference on a molecular level, since each kind of activity, e.g. [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] ability, [[biotransformation]] ability, [[solubility]], target activity, and so on, might depend on another difference. A good example was given in the [[bioisosterism]] review of Patanie/LaVoie.<ref name="pmid11848856">{{cite journal | author = Patani GA, LaVoie EJ | title = Bioisosterism: A Rational Approach in Drug Design | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 3147–3176 | year = 1996 | month = December | pmid = 11848856 | doi = 10.1021/cr950066q | url = | issn = }}</ref> In general, one is more interested in finding strong [[trend]]s. Created [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] usually rely on a [[finite set|finite]] number of chemical data. Thus, the [[Induction (philosophy)|induction principle]] should be respected to avoid [[Overfitting|overfitted]] hypotheses and deriving overfitted and useless interpretations on structural/molecular data. The SAR paradox refers to the fact that it is not the case that all similar molecules have similar activities. == Types == === Fragment based (group contribution) === It has been shown that the [[partition coefficient|logP]] of compound can be determined by the sum of its fragments. Fragmentary logP values have been determined statistically. This method gives mixed results and is generally not trusted to have accuracy of more than ±0.1 units.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Prediction of physicochemical parameters by atomic contributions | author = Wildman SA, Crippen GM | doi = 10.1021/ci990307l | year = 1999 | journal = J.

GQSAR allows flexibility to study various molecular fragments of interest in relation to the variation in biological response. The molecular fragments could be substituents at various substitution sites in congeneric set of molecules or could be on the basis of pre-defined chemical rules in case of non-congeneric set. GQSAR also considers cross-terms fragment descriptors, which could be helpful in identification of key fragment interactions in determining variation of activity.<ref name="Ajmani_2008">{{cite journal | author = Ajmani S, Jadhav K, Kulkarni SA | title = Group-Based QSAR (G-QSAR): Mitigating Interpretation Challenges in QSAR|journal=QSAR & Combinatorial Science | year = 2008 | month = November | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–51 | doi = 10.1002/qsar.200810063}}</ref> Lead discovery using Fragnomics is an emerging paradigm.

It uses computed potentials, e.g. the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], rather than experimental constants and is concerned with the overall molecule rather than a single substituent. It examines the steric fields (shape
