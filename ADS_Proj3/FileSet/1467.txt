The FNC consists of a group made up of representatives from the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD), the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), among others. As of October 1, 1997, FNC activities are carried out through the [[Large Scale Networking]] (LSN) group. FNC Advisory Committee was de-chartered and many of the FNC activities are or were transferred to the LSN of the [[Computing, Information, and Communications]] (CIC) R&D Subcommittee subcommittee or the Applications Council. On October 24, 1995, the Federal Networking Council famously passed a resolution defining the term Internet: ''Resolution: The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following language reflects our definition of the term ``Internet''. ``Internet'' refers to the global information system that - (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein.''

FCRC has been organised in 1993, 1996, 1999, 2003, and 2007; the next event will be held in 2011. In the first FCRC, the main organiser was the [[Computing Research Association]]; since then, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] has taken the lead in organising the event. The [[Turing Award]] 1998, 2002, and 2006 recipients gave plenary talks in FCRC 1999, 2003, and 2007. Other plenary speakers in FCRC include [[László Babai]], [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]], [[Randal Bryant]], [[Bob Colwell]], [[David Culler]], [[Cynthia Dwork]], [[Shafi Goldwasser]], [[Michael J. Flynn]], [[Hector Garcia-Molina]], [[John L.

[[Category:Computer science conferences]] {{comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>13393</id> <title>Federated Naming Service</title> <text>In [[computing]], the '''Federated Naming Service''' ('''FNS''') or '''XFN''' ('''X/Open Federated Naming''') is a system for uniting various name services under a single interface for the basic naming operations. It is produced by [[X/Open]] and included in various Unix operatings systems such as [[Solaris Operating Environment]] versions 2.5 to 9. The purpose of XFN and FNS is to allow applications to use widely heterogeneous naming services (such as [[Network Information Service|NIS]], [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and so on) via a single interface, to avoid duplication of programming effort. Unlike the similar [[LDAP]],
