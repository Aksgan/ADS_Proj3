concepts traditionally used by the public and those used by social scientists: bounded [[Group (sociology)|groups]] (e.g., tribes, families) and social [[Categorization|categories]] (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Scholars such as S.D. Berkowitz, Stephen Borgatti, [[Ronald Burt]], [[Kathleen Carley]], Martin Everett, Katherine Faust, Linton Freeman, [[Mark Granovetter]], David Knoke, [[David Krackhardt]], Peter Marsden, Nicholas Mullins, [[Anatol Rapoport#Social network analysis|Anatol Rapoport]], Stanley Wasserman, [[Barry Wellman]], [[Douglas R. White]], and [[Harrison White]] expanded the use of systematic social network analysis.<ref>Linton Freeman, ''The Development of Social Network Analysis.'' Vancouver: Empirical Press, 2006.</ref> '''Social network analysis''' has now moved from being a suggestive metaphor to an analytic approach to a paradigm, with its own theoretical statements, methods, [[social network analysis software]], and researchers. Analysts reason from whole to part; from structure to relation to individual; from behavior to attitude. They typically either study ''whole networks'' (also known as ''complete networks''), all of the ties containing specified relations in a defined population, or ''personal networks'' (also known as ''egocentric networks''), the ties that specified people have, such as their "personal communities".<ref>Wellman, Barry and S.D. Berkowitz, eds., 1988. ''Social Structures: A Network Approach.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> The distinction between whole/complete networks and personal/egocentric networks has depended largely on how analysts were able to gather data. That is, for groups such as companies, schools, or membership societies, the analyst was expected to have complete information about who was in the network, all participants being both potential egos and alters. Personal/egocentric studies were typically conducted when identities of egos were known, but not their alters. These studies rely on the egos to provide information about the identities of alters and there is no expectation that the various egos or sets of alters will be tied to each other. A ''snowball network'' refers to the idea that the alters identified in an egocentric survey then become egos themselves and are able in turn to nominate additional alters. While there are severe logistic limits to conducting snowball network studies, a method for examining ''hybrid networks'' has recently been developed in which egos in complete networks can nominate alters otherwise not listed who are then available for all subsequent egos to see.<ref>Hansen, William B. and Reese, Eric L. 2009. [https://secure.networkgenie.com/admin/documentation/Network_Genie_Manual.pdf Network Genie User Manual]. Greensboro, NC: Tanglewood Research.</ref> The hybrid network may be valuable for examining whole/complete networks that are expected to include important players beyond those who are formally identified. For example, employees of a company often work with non-company consultants who may be part of a network that cannot fully be defined prior to data collection. Several analytic tendencies distinguish social network analysis:<ref>Freeman, Linton. 2006. ''The Development of Social Network Analysis.'' Vancouver: Empirical Pres, 2006; Wellman, Barry and S.D. Berkowitz, eds., 1988. ''Social Structures: A Network Approach.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> :There is no assumption that groups are the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from nonlocal [[communities]] to links among [[website]]s. :Rather than treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses on how the structure of ties affects individuals and their relationships. :In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behavior, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. The shape of a social network helps determine a network's usefulness to its individuals. Smaller, tighter networks can be less useful to their members than networks with lots of loose connections ([[weak tie]]s) to individuals outside the main network. More open networks, with many weak ties and social connections, are more likely to introduce new ideas and opportunities to their members than closed networks with many redundant ties. In other words, a group of friends who only do things with each other already share the same knowledge and opportunities. A group of individuals with connections to other social worlds is likely to have access to a wider range of information. It is better for individual success to have connections to a variety of networks rather than many connections within a single network. Similarly, individuals can exercise influence or act as brokers within their social networks by bridging two networks that are not directly linked (called filling structural holes).<ref>Scott, John. 1991. ''Social Network Analysis.'' London: Sage.</ref> The power of social network analysis stems from its difference from traditional social scientific studies, which assume that it is the attributes of individual actors—whether they are friendly or unfriendly, smart or dumb, etc.—that matter. Social network analysis produces an alternate view, where the attributes of individuals are less important than their relationships and ties with other actors within the network. This approach has turned out to be useful for explaining many real-world phenomena, but leaves less room for individual agency, the ability for individuals to influence their success, because so much of it rests within the structure of their network. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many informal connections that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations. For example, power within organizations often comes more from the degree to which an individual within a network is at the center of many relationships than actual job title. Social networks also play a key role in hiring, in business success, and in job performance. Networks provide ways for companies to gather information, deter competition, and [[collusion|collude]] in setting prices or policies.<ref>Wasserman, Stanley, and Faust, Katherine. 1994.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> ==History of social network analysis== A summary of the progress of social networks and social network analysis has been written by Linton Freeman.<ref>''The Development of Social Network Analysis'' Vancouver: Empirical Press.</ref> Precursors of social networks in the late 1800s include [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]]. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (''gemeinschaft'') or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (''gesellschaft'').
