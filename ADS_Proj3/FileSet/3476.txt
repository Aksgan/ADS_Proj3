adds new features of the IBM LaserPrinter 4029 to the previous PPDS levels. These features include compression, scalable fonts, and enhanced orientations. *Raster Image: Allows the compression and decompression of data *Comprehensive Font Selection: Added the support for scalable fonts *Set Print Angle: Adds support for different angles ==PPDS vs. PCL 1-5== Both languages define different printable areas for a given physical medium. PCL and PPDS use different characteristics or orders when searching for a substitute font. PCL uses ASCII-encoded numerical values as command parameter, while PPDS uses binary encoded parameter. ==Modern printer support== Several modern Lexmark printers (an example would be the Lexmark E450dn) still support PPDS Level 4 in order to provide a high level of support for legacy applications which were written specifically for IBM 4019 and 4029 laser printers.

[[Computer Mouse|Mouse]]</div>]]A [[personal computer]] is made up of multiple physical components of '''computer hardware''', upon which can be installed a system software called [[operating system]] and a multitude of [[Computer software|software]] applications to perform the operator's desired functions. Though a PC comes in many different forms, a typical [[personal computer]] consists of a [[Computer case|case]] or chassis in a tower shape (desktop), containing components such as a [[motherboard]]. ==Motherboard== {{Main|Motherboard}} The motherboard is the main component inside the case. It is a large rectangular board with integrated circuitry that connects the rest of the parts of the computer including the [[CPU]], the [[RAM]], the disk drives ([[CD]], [[DVD]], [[hard disk]], or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots. Components directly attached to the motherboard include: * The '''[[central processing unit]] ('''CPU''')''' performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is sometimes referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It is usually [[Computer cooling#Spot cooling|cooled]] by a heat sink and fan. * The '''[[chip set]]''' mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory. * '''[[Random-access memory|RAM]]''' (Random Access Memory) stores resident part of the current running OS (OS core and so on) and all running processes (applications parts, using CPU or input/output (I/O) channels or waiting for CPU or I/O channels). * The '''[[BIOS]]''' includes boot [[firmware]] and power management. The '''B'''asic '''I'''nput '''O'''utput '''S'''ystem tasks are handled by [[operating system]] drivers. * '''Internal [[Bus (computing)|Buses]]''' connect the CPU to various internal components and to expansion cards for graphics and sound. ** '''Current''' *** The [[Northbridge (computing)|north bridge]] memory controller, for RAM and PCI Express **** [[PCI Express]], for expansion cards such as graphics and physics processors, and high-end network interfaces *** [[Conventional PCI|PCI]], for other expansion cards *** [[Serial ATA|SATA]], for disk drives ** '''Obsolete''' *** [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] (superseded by SATA) *** [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] (superseded by PCI Express) *** [[VESA Local Bus|VLB]] VESA Local Bus (superseded by AGP) *** [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] (expansion card slot format obsolete in PCs, but still used in industrial computers) *'''External Bus Controllers''' support ports for external peripherals. These ports may be controlled directly by the [[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]] I/O controller or based on expansion cards attached to the motherboard through the PCI bus. ** [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ** [[FireWire]] ** [[Serial ATA|eSATA]] ** [[SCSI]] ==Power supply== {{Main|Power supply unit (computer)}} [[File:Computer_from_inside_018.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Inside a custom-built computer: the power supply at the bottom has its own cooling fan.]]A power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage DC power for the internal components of the computer. Some power supplies have a switch to change between 230 V and 115 V. Other models have automatic sensors that switch input voltage automatically, or are able to accept any voltage between those limits. Power supply units used in computers are nearly always [[Switch mode power supply|switch mode power supplies (SMPS)]]. The SMPS provides regulated direct current power at the several voltages required by the motherboard and accessories such as disk drives and cooling fans. ==Removable media devices== {{Main|Computer storage}} * [[Compact Disc|CD]] (compact disc) - the most common type of removable media, suitable for music and data. ** [[CD-ROM|CD-ROM Drive]] - a device used for reading data from a CD. ** [[Optical disc drive|CD Writer]] - a device used for both reading and writing data to and from a CD. * [[DVD]] (digital versatile disc) - a popular type of removable media that is the same dimensions as a CD but stores up to 12 times as much information. It is the most common way of transferring digital video, and is popular for data storage. ** [[DVD|DVD-ROM Drive]] - a device used for reading data from a DVD. ** [[DVD|DVD Writer]] - a device used for both reading and writing data to and from a DVD. ** [[DVD-RAM|DVD-RAM Drive]] - a device used for rapid writing and reading of data from a special type of DVD. * [[Blu-ray Disc]] - a high-density optical disc format for data and high-definition video. Can store 70 times as much information as a CD. ** [[Blu-ray Disc|BD-ROM Drive]] - a device used for reading data from a Blu-ray disc. ** [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD Writer]] - a device used for both reading and writing data to and from a Blu-ray disc. * [[HD DVD]] - a discontinued competitor to the Blu-ray format. * [[Floppy disk]] - an outdated storage device consisting of a thin disk of a flexible magnetic storage medium. Used today mainly for loading RAID drivers. * [[Iomega Zip drive]] - an outdated medium-capacity removable disk storage system, first introduced by Iomega in 1994. * [[USB flash drive]] - a flash memory data storage device integrated with a USB interface, typically small, lightweight, removable,
