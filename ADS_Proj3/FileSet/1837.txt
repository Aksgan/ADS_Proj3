has been depleted. Analysis of the molecular basis for this bi-phasic growth curve led to the discovery of the basic mechanisms that control [[gene expression]]. ==Cancer cell growth== [[Cancer]] research is an area of biology where growth curve analysis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=%22growth+curve%22%5BAll+Fields%5D+AND+cmed6%5Bbook%5D+AND+351845%5Buid%5D&rid=cmed6.section.10278] plays an important role. In many types of cancer, the rate at which [[tumor]]s shrink following [[chemotherapy]] is related to the rate of tumor growth before treatment. Tumors that grow rapidly are generally more sensitive to the toxic effects that conventional [[anticancer drugs]] have on the cancer [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Many conventional anticancer drugs (for example, [[5-Fluoro Uracil]]) interfere with [[DNA replication]] and can cause the death of cells that attempt to replicate their DNA and divide. A rapidly growing tumor will have more actively dividing cells and more cell death upon exposure to such anticancer drugs. [[Image:Cancergrowth.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2. Tumor growth curve.]] In the example shown in Figure 2, a tumor is found after the cell growth rate has slowed. Most of the cancer cells are removed by surgery. The remaining cancer cells begin to proliferate rapidly and cancer chemotherapy is started. Many tumor cells are killed by the chemotherapy, but eventually some cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapy drug begin to grow rapidly. The chemotherapy is no longer useful and is discontinued. ==The growth of children== Children who fall significantly below the normal range of growth curves for body height [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/growthcharts/set1clinical/cj41c021.pdf] can be tested for [[growth hormone deficiency]] and might be treatable with hormone injections [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001176.htm]. ==Exponential growth== Some growth curves for certain biological systems display periods of [[exponential growth]]. Typically, periods of exponential growth are of limited duration due to depletion of some rate-limiting resource. ==See also== *[[Gompertz function]] ==Notes== <references/> ==Bibliography== * {{cite book |title=Nonlinear Models for Repeated Measurement Data <!-- |authorlink=Marie Davidian --> |first=Marie |last=Davidian |coauthor=David M.

It helps ensure that the employee makes his or her appointed rounds at the correct intervals and can offer a virtually indisputable record for legal or insurance reasons. Such systems have existed for many years using mechanical [[watchclock]]-based systems (watchman clocks/guard tour clocks/patrol clocks). Computerized systems were first introduced in Europe in the early 80s, and in North America in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Bill |coauthors=Robert R. Macdonald |month=March |year=1991 |title= High-Tech Touring |journal=Security Management |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=25}}</ref> Modern systems are based on handheld [[data logger]]s and [[RFID]] sensors. Essentially, the system provides a means to record the time when the employee reaches certain important points on their tour (and, of course, the fact that they reached these points at all). Checkpoints or Watchstations are commonly placed at the extreme ends of the tour route and at critical points such as [[bank vault|vaults]], [[specimen]] [[refrigerators]], vital equipment, access points, etc. Some systems are set so that the interval between stations is timed so if the employee fails to reach each point within a set time, other staff are dispatched to investigate and ensure the employee's well-being. An example of a modern set-up might work as follows: The employee carries an portable electronic sensor (PES) or electronic data collector which is activated at each checkpoint. Checkpoints can consist of [[iButton]] semiconductors, magnetic strips, proximity microchips such as [[RFID]]s, or optical [[barcodes]]. The data collector stores the serial number of the checkpoint with the date and time. Later, the information is downloaded from the collector into a [[computer]] where the checkpoint's [[serial number]] will have an assigned location (i.e. North Perimeter Fence, Cell Number 1, etc.). Data collectors can also be programmed to ignore duplicate checkpoint activations that occur sequentially or within a certain time period. Computer [[software]] used to compile the
