interval <math>[0, T]</math>, i.e. all the [[finite set]]s of [[real number]]s <math>t_i</math> such that :<math>0 = t_{0} < t_{1} < \ldots < t_{k} = T.</math> The original notion of [[Total variation|variation]] considered above is the special case of <math>\scriptstyle \varphi</math>-variation for which the weight function is the [[identity function]]: therefore an [[integrable function]] <math>f</math> is said to be a '''weighted ''BV'' function''' (of weight <math>\scriptstyle\varphi</math>) if and only if its <math>\scriptstyle \varphi</math>-variation is finite. :<math>f\in BV_\varphi([0, T];X)\iff \mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f) <+\infty</math> The space <math>\scriptstyle BV_\varphi([0, T];X)</math> is a [[topological vector space]] with respect to the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] :<math>\| f \|_{BV_\varphi} := \| f \|_{\infty} + \mathop{\varphi \mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f),</math> where <math>\scriptstyle\| f \|_{\infty}</math> denotes the usual [[supremum norm]] of ''<math>f</math>''. Weighted ''BV'' functions were introduced and studied in full generality by [[Wladislav Orlicz]] and [[Julian Musielak]] in the paper {{Harv|Musielak|Orlicz|1959}}: [[Laurence Chisholm Young]] studied earlier the case <math>\scriptstyle\varphi(x)=x^p</math> where ''<math>p</math>'' is a positive integer. ===''SBV'' functions=== '''SBV functions''' ''i.e.'' ''Special functions of Bounded Variation'' where introduced by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Ennio de Giorgi]] in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|De Giorgi|1988}}, dealing with free discontinuity [[variational problem]]s: given an [[open subset]] '''<math> \Omega </math>''' of ℝ''<sup>n</sup>'', the space '''<math>SBV(\Omega)</math>''' is a proper [[subspace]] of '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''', since the [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of each function belonging to it const exactly of the [[sum]] of a <math>n</math>-[[dimension]]al [[Support (mathematics)|support]] and a <math>n-1</math>-[[dimension]]al [[Support (mathematics)|support]] [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] and ''no intermediate-dimensional terms'', as seen in the following definition. '''Definition'''. Given a [[locally integrable function]] '''<math>u</math>''', then <math>\scriptstyle u\in {S\!BV}(\Omega) </math> if and only if '''1.''' There exist two [[Borel function]]s <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> of [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] '''<math>\Omega</math>''' and [[codomain]] ℝ''<sup>n</sup>'' such that :<math> \int_\Omega\vert f\vert dH^n+ \int_\Omega\vert g\vert dH^{n-1}<+\infty.</math> '''2.''' For all of [[Smooth function|continuously differentiable]] [[Vector valued function|vector functions]] <math> \scriptstyle\phi </math> of [[support (mathematics)#Compact support|compact support]] contained in '''<math> \Omega </math>''', ''i.e.'' for all <math> \scriptstyle \phi \in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> the following formula is true: :<math> \int_\Omega u\mbox{div} \phi dH^n = \int_\Omega \langle \phi, f\rangle dH^n +\int_\Omega \langle \phi, g\rangle dH^{n-1}.</math> where <math>H^\alpha</math> is the <math>\alpha</math>-[[dimension]]al [[Hausdorff measure]]. Details on the properties of ''SBV'' functions can be found in works cited in the bibliography section: particularly the paper {{Harv|De Giorgi|1992}} contains a useful [[bibliography]]. ===''bv'' sequences=== As particular examples of [[Banach spaces]], {{harvtxt|Dunford|Schwartz|1958|loc=Chapter IV}} consider spaces of '''sequences of bounded variation''', in addition to the spaces of functions of bounded variation. The total variation of a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] ''x''=(''x''<sub>i</sub>) of real or complex numbers is defined by :<math>TV(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.</math> The space of all sequences of finite total variation is denoted by ''bv''. The norm on ''bv'' is given by :<math>\|x\|_{bv} = |x_1| + TV(x) = |x_1| + \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.</math> With this norm, the space ''bv'' is a Banach space. The total variation itself defines a norm on a certain subspace of ''bv'', denoted by ''bv''<sub>0</sub>, consisting of sequences ''x'' = (''x''<sub>i</sub>) for which :<math>\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n =0.</math> The norm on ''bv''<sub>0</sub> is denoted :<math>\|x\|_{bv_0} = TV(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.</math> With respect to this norm ''bv''<sub>0</sub> becomes a Banach space as well. ===Measures of bounded variation=== A [[signed measure|signed]] (or [[complex measure|complex]]) [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''<math>\mu</math>'' on a [[sigma-algebra|measurable space]] <math>(X,\Sigma)</math> is said to be of bounded variation if its [[Total variation#Total variation in measure theory|total variation]]'' <math>\scriptstyle\Vert \mu\Vert=|\mu|(X)</math>'' is bounded: see {{harvtxt|Halmos|1950|p=123}}, {{harvtxt|Kolmogorov|Fomin|1969|p=346}} or the entry "[[total variation]]" for further details. ==Examples== [[Image:Sin x^-1.svg|right|thumb|The function ''f''(''x'')=sin(1/''x'') is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2 / \pi] </math>.]] The function :<math>f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if }x =0 \\ \sin(1/x), & \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} </math> is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0, 2/\pi]</math> [[Image:Xsin(x^-1).svg|thumb|right|The function ''f''(''x'')=''x'' sin(1/''x'') is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2 / \pi] </math>.]] While it is harder to see, the function :<math>f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if }x =0 \\ x \sin(1/x), & \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} </math> is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0, 2/\pi]</math> either. [[Image:X^2sin(x^-1).svg|thumb|right|The function ''f''(''x'')=''x''<sup>2</sup> sin(1/''x'') ''is'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2 / \pi] </math>.]] At the same time, the function :<math>f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if }x =0 \\ x^2 \sin(1/x), & \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} </math> is of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2/\pi]</math>. However, ''all three functions are of bounded variation on each interval'' <math>[a,b]</math> ''with'' <math>a>0</math>. The [[Sobolev space]] '''<math> W^{1,1}(\Omega)</math>''' is a [[proper subset]] of '''<math> BV(\Omega)</math>'''. In fact, for each '''<math> u </math>''' in '''<math> W^{1,1}(\Omega) </math>''' it is possible to choose a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] <math> \scriptstyle \mu:=\nabla u \mathcal L</math> (where <math> \scriptstyle\mathcal L</math> is the [[Lebesgue measure]] on '''<math>\Omega</math>''') such that the equality :<math> \int u\mathrm{div}\phi = -\int \phi\, d\mu = -\int \phi \nabla u \qquad \forall \phi\in C_c^1 </math> holds, since it is nothing more than the definition of [[weak derivative]], and hence holds true. One can easily find an example of a ''BV'' function which is not '''<math>W^{1,1}</math>''': in dimension one, any step function with a non-trivial jump will do. ==Applications== === Mathematics === Functions of bounded variation have been studied in connection with the set of [[classification of discontinuities|discontinuities]] of functions and differentiability of real functions, and the following results are well-known. If <math>f</math> is a [[real number|real]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of bounded variation on an interval <math>[a,b]</math> then * <math>f</math> is [[continuous function|continuous]] except at most on a [[countable set]]; * <math>f</math> has [[one-sided limit]]s everywhere (limits from the left everywhere in <math>(a,b]</math>, and from the right everywhere in <math>[a,b)</math> ; * the [[derivative]] <math>f'(x)</math> exists [[almost everywhere]] (i.e. except for a set of [[measure zero]]). For [[real number|real]] [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of several real variables * the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of a [[Caccioppoli set]] is a ''BV'' function: ''BV'' functions lie at the basis of the modern theory of perimeters. * [[Minimal surface]]s are [[Graph of a function|graph]]s of ''BV'' functions: in this context, see reference {{Harv|Giusti|1984}}. ===Physics and engineering=== The ability of ''BV'' functions to deal with discontinuities has made their use widespread in the
