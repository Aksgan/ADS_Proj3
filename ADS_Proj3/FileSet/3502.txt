A shortcoming of current formats for describing phylogenetic trees (such as [[Nexus_file|Nexus]] and [[Newick_format|Newick/New Hampshire]]) is a lack of a standardized means to annotate tree nodes and branches with distinct data fields (which in the case of a basic species tree might be: species names, branch lengths, and possibly multiple support values). Data storage and exchange is even more cumbersome in studies in which trees are the result of a reconciliation of some kind: * gene-function studies (requires annotation of nodes with taxonomic information as well as gene names, and possibly gene-duplication data) * evolution of host-parasite interactions (requires annotation of tree nodes with taxonomic information for both host and parasite) * phylogeographic studies (requires annotation of tree nodes with taxonomic and geographic information) To alleviate this, a variety of ad-hoc, special purpose formats have come into use (such as the [[NHX format]], which focuses on the needs of gene-function and phylogenomic studies). A well defined XML format addresses these problems in a general and extensible manner and allows for interoperability between specialized and general purpose software. An example of a program for visualizing phyloXML is [[Archaeopteryx_(evolutionary_tree_visualization_and_analysis)|Archaeopteryx]]. ==Basic phyloXML example== <phyloxml xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.phyloxml.org http://www.phyloxml.org/1.10/phyloxml.xsd" xmlns="http://www.phyloxml.org"> <phylogeny rooted="true"> <name>example from Prof. Joe Felsenstein's book "Inferring Phylogenies"</name> <description>MrBayes based on MAFFT alignment</description> <clade> <clade branch_length="0.06"> <confidence type="probability">0.88</confidence> <clade branch_length="0.102"> <name>A</name> </clade> <clade branch_length="0.23"> <name>B</name> </clade> </clade> <clade branch_length="0.4"> <name>C</name> </clade> </clade> </phylogeny> </phyloxml> ==References== <references/> ==External links== *[http://www.phyloxml.org www.phyloxml.org] *[http://phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/ Archaeopteryx] *[http://www.phylosoft.org/NHX/ NHX format] {{genomics-footer}} [[Category:XML-based standards]] [[Category:Bioinformatics]] [[Category:Bioinformatics software]] [[Category:Computational phylogenetics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29212</id> <title>Physiological interaction</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=November 2006}} '''Physiological interaction''' goes beyond the physical interfaces that a computer has, which would include the input and output devices. Physiological interfaces actually secure and use real body characteristics, including breathing, talking, and height and weight. Some of the top innovations include automatic speech recognition (ASR), virtual reality, cave automatic virtual environments (CAVE), and biometrics. (Haag, 2006) ==Automatic speech recognition== The [[automatic speech recognition (ASR)]] system will capture spoken words and then classify word groupings to form a sentence. ASR is computer-driven and transcribes spoken language into text that can be read by using real time. Special applications for this system may be used to help deaf and hard of hearing people understand what is being said. (NETAC, 1998) This technology is becoming more popular in computing environments as well. Call centres are taking on automatic speech recognition in order to decrease the amount of clients who hang up because they are not talking to a live operator. (Haag, 2006) In order for an ASR system to function, it must follow three steps. The system will capture words that are spoken into a microphone, while taking out any background noises, and then converting the digital signals of the speech into syllables (phonemes). This is referred to as feature analysis. Next, the system will match the spoken syllables to a phoneme sequence that is kept in an acoustic model database. This is called pattern classification. The system will then try to make sense of what is being said by comparing the word phonemes from the previous step, this time with a language model database. (Haag, 2006) ==Virtual reality== The second physiological innovation is [[virtual reality]], which is a “three-dimensional computer simulation in which [a person] actively and physically participates.” (Haag, 2006, p. 364) Virtual reality has been used to train astronauts at NASA. This type of interaction uses special input and output devices in order to take physiological movements and send responses back to the person. Virtual reality includes three devices. 1.
