a number of people, the name '''Kripke–Joyal semantics''' is often used in this connection. ==Model constructions== As in the classical [[model theory]], there are methods for constructing a new Kripke model from other models. The natural [[homomorphism]]s in Kripke semantics are called '''p-morphisms''' (which is short for ''pseudo-epimorphism'', but the latter term is rarely used). A p-morphism of Kripke frames <math>\langle W,R\rangle</math> and <math>\langle W',R'\rangle</math> is a mapping <math>f\colon W\to W'</math> such that * ''f'' preserves the accessibility relation, i.e., ''u R v'' implies ''f''(''u'') ''R’'' ''f''(''v''), * whenever ''f''(''u'') ''R’'' ''v''’, there is a ''v'' ∈ ''W'' such that ''u R v'' and ''f''(''v'') = ''v''’. A p-morphism of Kripke models <math>\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle</math> and <math>\langle W',R',\Vdash'\rangle</math> is a p-morphism of their underlying frames <math>f\colon W\to W'</math>, which satisfies : <math>w\Vdash p</math> if and only if <math>f(w)\Vdash'p</math>, for any propositional variable ''p''. P-morphisms are a special kind of [[bisimulation]]s. In general, a '''bisimulation''' between frames <math>\langle W,R\rangle</math> and <math>\langle W',R'\rangle</math> is a relation ''B ⊆ W × W’'', which satisfies the following “zig-zag” property: * if ''u B u’'' and ''u R v'', there exists ''v’'' ∈ ''W’'' such that ''v B v’'' and ''u’ R’ v’'', * if ''u B u’'' and ''u’ R’ v’'', there exists ''v'' ∈ ''W'' such that ''v B v’'' and ''u R v''. A bisimulation of models is additionally required to preserve forcing of [[atomic formula]]s: : if ''w B w’'', then <math>w\Vdash p</math> if and only if <math>w'\Vdash'p</math>, for any propositional variable ''p''. The key property which follows from this definition is that bisimulations (hence also p-morphisms) of models preserve the satisfaction of ''all'' formulas, not only propositional variables. We can transform a Kripke model into a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] using '''unravelling'''. Given a model <math>\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle</math> and a fixed node ''w''<sub>0</sub> ∈ ''W'', we define a model <math>\langle W',R',\Vdash'\rangle</math>, where ''W’'' is the set of all finite sequences <math>s=\langle w_0,w_1,\dots,w_n\rangle</math> such that ''w<sub>i</sub> R w<sub>i+1</sub>'' for all ''i'' < ''n'', and <math>s\Vdash p</math> if and only if <math>w_n\Vdash p</math> for a propositional variable ''p''. The definition of the accessibility relation ''R’'' varies; in the simplest case we put :<math>\langle w_0,w_1,\dots,w_n\rangle\;R'\;\langle w_0,w_1,\dots,w_n,w_{n+1}\rangle</math>, but many applications need the reflexive and/or transitive closure of this relation, or similar modifications. '''Filtration''' is a variant of a p-morphism. Let ''X'' be a set of formulas closed under taking subformulas. An ''X''-filtration of a model <math>\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle</math> is a mapping ''f'' from ''W'' to a model <math>\langle W',R',\Vdash'\rangle</math> such that * ''f'' is a [[surjection]], * ''f'' preserves the accessibility relation, and (in both directions) satisfaction of variables ''p'' ∈ ''X'', * if ''f''(''u'') ''R’'' ''f''(''v'') and <math>u\Vdash\Box A</math>, where <math>\Box A\in X</math>, then <math>v\Vdash A</math>. It follows that ''f'' preserves satisfaction of all formulas from ''X''. In typical applications, we take ''f'' as the projection onto the [[quotient set|quotient]] of ''W'' over the relation : ''u ≡<sub>X</sub> v'' if and only if for all ''A'' ∈ ''X'', <math>u\Vdash A</math> if and only if <math>v\Vdash A</math>. As in the case of unravelling, the definition of the accessibility relation on the quotient varies. ==General frame semantics== The main defect of Kripke semantics is the existence of Kripke incomplete logics, and logics which are complete but not compact. It can be remedied by equipping Kripke frames with extra structure which restricts the set of possible valuations, using ideas from algebraic semantics. This gives rise to the [[general frame]] semantics. ==History and terminology== {{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}} Kripke semantics does not originate with Kripke, but instead the idea of giving semantics in the style given above, that is based on valuations made that are relative to nodes, predates Kripke by a long margin: * [[Rudolf Carnap]] seems to have been the first to have the idea that one can give a '''possible world semantics''' for the modalities of necessity and possibility by means of giving the valuation function a parameter that ranges over Leibnizian possible worlds. Bayart develops this idea further, but neither gave recursive definitions of satisfaction in the style introduced by Tarski; * J.C.C. McKinsey and [[Alfred Tarski]] developed an approach to modeling modal logics that is still influential in modern research, namely the algebraic approach, in which Boolean algebras with operators are used as models. [[Bjarni Jónsson]] and Tarski established the representability of Boolean algebras with operators in terms of frames. If the two ideas had been put together, the result would have been precisely frame models, which is to say Kripke models, years before Kripke. But no one (not even Tarski) saw the connection at the time. *[[Arthur Prior]], building on unpublished work of [[C. A. Meredith]], developed a translation of sentential modal logic into classical predicate logic that, if he had combined it with the usual model theory for the latter, would have produced a model theory equivalent to Kripke models for the former. But his approach was resolutely syntactic and anti-model-theoretic. * [[Stig Kanger]] gave a rather more complex approach to the interpretation of modal logic, but one that contains many of the key ideas of Kripke's approach. He first noted the relationship between conditions on accessibility relations and [[C.I. Lewis|Lewis]]-style axioms for modal logic. Kanger failed, however, to give a completeness proof for his system; * [[Jaakko Hintikka]] gave a semantics in his papers introducing epistemic logic that is a simple variation of Kripke's semantics, equivalent to the characterisation of valuations by means of maximal consistent sets. He doesn't give inference rules for epistemic logic, and so cannot give a completeness proof; * [[Richard Montague]] had many of the key ideas contained in Kripke's work, but he did not regard them as significant, because he had no completeness proof, and so did not publish until after Kripke's papers had created a sensation in the logic community; * [[Evert Willem Beth]] presented a semantics of intuitionistic logic based on trees, which closely resembles Kripke semantics, except for using a more cumbersome definition of satisfaction. Though the essential ideas of '''Kripke semantics''' were very much in
