merchants wish to identify the best combination of [[price]] and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] to achieve desired sales, [[gross margin]], inventory or [[market share]] objectives. The '''methods used''' are similar to those applied in the related field of [[supply chain optimization]], where mathematical algorithms are applied to large databases of sales data to help [[Forecasting|predict future outcomes]]. In the case of demand optimization, as well as in house sales history, there may be competitive pricing information. Because it is still a new field, authoritative data on the '''benefits of demand optimization''' is not widely available, although suppliers offer [[case studies]] of early adopters which claim rapid [[return on investment]], especially in the optimization of the timing and level of [[price markdown]]s. ==See also== *[[Demand shortfall]] *[[Price]] *[[Profit maximization]] *[[Yield management]] *[[Price discrimination]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Demand Optimization}} [[Category:Pricing]] [[Category:Mathematical optimization]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9916</id> <title>Demarcation point</title> <text>[[Image:Demarc.jpg|thumb|right|Old and new style demarcation points in a Canadian home built in 1945. A splitter for a [[DSL]] modem has been plugged into the modern demarc (on the right). One line passes through a DSL filter before going to the old demarc, and from there to the remainder of the house.]] In [[telephony]], the '''demarcation point''' is the point at which the [[telephone company]] network ends and connects with the wiring at the customer premises. A demarcation point is also referred to as the '''demarc''', '''DMARC''', '''MPOE''' ('''minimum point of entry''' or '''main point of entry'''). The demarcation point varies between countries and has changed over time. ==History== Prior to the [[Bell System divestiture]] on January 1, 1984, [[American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T) through its [[Bell System]] companies held a [[natural monopoly]] for telephone service within the United States. AT&T owned the [[local loop]], including the telephone wiring within the [[On-premises wiring|customer premises]] and the customer telephone equipment. A similar arrangement existed with smaller, regional telephone companies such as [[GTE]]. As a result of deregulation of the telephone system, [[Local loop unbundling|unbundling]] of the local loop, and [[Hush-a-Phone v. FCC|lawsuits by companies wishing to sell third-party equipment]] to connect to the telephone network, there was a need to delineate the portion of the network which was owned by the customer and the portion owned by the telephone company or the [[common carrier]]. Where the portions meet is called the '''demarcation point'''. ==Equipment== ===Canada=== [[Image:Demarc2.JPG|thumb|right|20th century Bell Canada demarcation point for a single phone line. The spark-gap [[surge protector]]s on the left have hex heads for easy removal. Near center, a post is connected to the house's [[electrical ground]]. The other two connection points are for [[tip and ring]]. A test jack can be attached nearby so the home-owner or tenant can verify whether the inside wiring is at fault. Modern Bell Canada demarcation points are [[Network interface device]]s]] The demarcation point varies from building type and service level. In its simplest form, the demarcation point is a [[junction block]] where [[Extension (telephone)|telephone extensions]] join to connect to the network. This junction block usually includes a [[lightning arrestor]] (which requires a wire to [[earth ground]].) In multi-line installations such as businesses or apartment buildings, the demarcation point may be a [[punch down block]]. In most places this hardware existed before deregulation. ===United States=== [[Image:Network interface device ameritech.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[network interface device]]s.]] In the United States, the modern demarcation point is a device defined by [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules (47 C.F.R. Part 68) <ref> "http://www.part68.org". ''[[Federal Communications Commission]]''.</ref> to allow safe connection of third-party telephone [[Customer-premises equipment]] and wiring to the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] (PSTN). The modern demarcation point is the [[network interface device]] (NID). The NID is the telco's property. The NID may be outdoors (typically, mounted on the building exterior in a weatherproof box) or indoors. The NID is usually placed for easy access by a technician. It also contains a lightning arrestor, [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] and test circuitry which allows the carrier to remotely test whether a wiring fault lies in the customer premises or in the carrier wiring, without requiring a technician at the premises. The demarcation point has a user accessible [[RJ-11]] jack (a "test jack" or "demarcation jack"), which is connected directly to the telephone network, and a small loop of telephone cord connecting to the jack by a [[modular connector]]. When the loop is disconnected, the [[on-premises wiring]] is isolated from the telephone network and the customer may directly connect a telephone to the network via the jack to assist in determining the location of a wiring fault. In most cases, everything from the [[central office]] to and including the demarcation point is owned by the carrier and everything past it is owned by the property owner. As the local loop becomes upgraded, with [[fiber optic]] and [[coaxial cable]] technologies sometimes replacing the original [[unshielded twisted pair]] to the premises, the demarcation point has grown to incorporate the equipment necessary to interface the original premises [[Plain_old_telephone_service|POTS]] wiring and equipment to the new communication channel. Demarcation points on houses created prior to the [[Bell System divestiture]] usually do not contain a test jack. They only contained a spark-gap surge protector, a [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] post and mount point to connect a single telephone line. The second wire pair were usually left unconnected and were kept as a spare pair in case the first pair were damaged. ===United Kingdom=== [[Image:BT NTE5.JPG|thumb|A [[British Telecom]] NTE5 linebox, showing the removable front plate and test jack.]] {{main|British telephone sockets}} In the United Kingdom, the demarcation point occurs ''within'' a jack (the '''master socket'''), whose wiring is partly owned by the customer, partly owned by the phone company. Other jacks are the customer's property. Newer NTE5 jacks have a removable front panel: the front panel and its wiring is the customer's, while the rear wiring is BT's. The removable panel allows separation of these two parts and independent maintenance, and access to a test jack to determine whether line faults are in the customer's wiring or BT's. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== {{colbegin}} *[[Demarc extension]] *[[Interconnection]] *[[Customer-premises equipment]] *[[On-premises wiring]] *[[Point of appearance]]
