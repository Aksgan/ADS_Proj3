have trialed the Open Peer Review concept, with many organizations making subsequent advances to the concept proper since its inception in c. ~1996.{{When|date=March 2010}} ===Early era: 1996-2000=== {{Cleanup|section|date=March 2010}} In 1996, the ''[[Journal of Interactive Media in Education]]''<ref>[http://www-jime.open.ac.uk/ Journal of Interactive Media in Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> launched using open peer review.<ref>[http://www-jime.open.ac.uk/about.html#lifecycle About JIME<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Reviewers' names are made public and they are therefore accountable for their review, but they also have their contribution acknowledged. Authors have the right of reply, and other researchers have the chance to comment prior to publication. In 1999, the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]''<ref>[http://www.jmir.org/ JMIR Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was launched, which from its inception decided to publish the names of the reviewers at the bottom of each published article. Also in 1999, the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/ bmj.com: BMJ - Helping doctors make better decisions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> moved to an open peer review system, revealing reviewers' identities to the authors (but not the readers),<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7175/4 Opening up BMJ peer review - Smith 318 (7175): 4 - BMJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and in 2000, the medical journals in the open access [[BMC series]]<ref>[http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/authors/bmcseries BMC series]</ref> published by [[BioMed Central]], launched using open peer review. As with the ''[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]]'', the reviewers' names are included on the peer review reports. In addition, if the article is published the reports are made available online as part of the 'pre-publication history'. Several of the other journals published by the [[BMJ Group]]<ref>[http://www.bmjgroup.com/ BMJ Group website — BMJ Group website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> allow optional open peer review,<ref>[http://ard.bmj.com/ifora/peer_rev.dtl Peer review at ARD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://jme.bmj.com/ifora/peer_rev.dtl Peer review at JME<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://emj.bmj.com/ifora/peer_rev.dtl Peer review at EMJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as do ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'', published by the [[Public Library of Science]].<ref>[http://www.plos.org/ Public Library of Science<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/reviewer_guidelines.php#anonymity PLoS Medicine: A Peer-Reviewed, Open-Access Journal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The ''[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]]'''s [[Rapid Responses]]<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters?lookup=by_date&days=1 bmj.com Rapid Responses published in the past day<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> allow ongoing debate and criticism following publication.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7347/1171 Twenty thousand conversations - Delamothe and Smith 324 (7347): 1171 - BMJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By 2005, the editors found it necessary to more rigorously enforce the criteria for acceptance of Rapid Responses, to weed out the "bores".<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7503/1284 Revitalising rapid responses - Davies and Delamothe 330 (7503): 1284 - BMJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ===Recent era: 2001-present=== ''[[Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics]]'', an [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal launched in 2001 by the [[European Geosciences Union]], has a two-stage publication process. In the first stage, papers that pass a quick screen by the editors are immediately published on the ''Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions'' website. They are then subject to interactive public discussion alongside formal peer review. Referees' comments (either anonymous or attributed), additional short comments by other members of the scientific community (which must be attributed) and the authors' replies are also published in ''ACPD''. In the second stage, the peer-review process is completed and, if the article is formally accepted by the editors, the final revised papers are published in ''ACP''. The success of this approach is shown by the ranking by [[Thomson Reuters]] of ''ACP'' as the top journal in the field of Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences [http://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/news_acp_jcr2007_attachment.pdf]. A similar approach is taken by the journal ''[http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/ Semantic Web - Interoperability, Usability, Applicability]'' launched in 2010. In June 2006, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' launched an experiment in parallel open peer review — some articles that had been submitted to the regular anonymous process were also available online for open, identified public comment.<ref>[http://blogs.nature.com/nature/peerreview/trial/ Peer Review Trial<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The results were less than encouraging — only 5% of authors agreed to participate in the experiment, and only 54% of those articles received comments.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature05535.html Overview: Nature's trial of open peer review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/full/444971b.html Peer review and fraud: Article: Nature<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The editors have suggested that researchers may have been too busy to take part and were reluctant to make their names public. The knowledge that articles were simultaneously being subjected to anonymous peer review may also have affected the uptake. In 2006, a group of UK academics launched the online journal ''[[Philica]]'', which tries to redress many of the problems of traditional peer review. Unlike in a normal journal, all articles submitted to ''Philica'' are published immediately and the review process takes place afterwards. Reviews are still anonymous, but instead of reviewers being chosen by an editor, any researcher who wishes to review an article can do so. Reviews are displayed at the end of each article, and so are used to give the reader criticism or guidance about the work, rather than to decide whether it is published or not. This means that reviewers cannot suppress ideas if they disagree with them. Readers use reviews to guide what they read, and particularly popular or unpopular work is easy to identify. Another approach that is similar in spirit to ''Philica'' is that of a dynamical peer review site, [[Naboj]].<ref>[http://www.naboj.com Naboj Dynamical Peer Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Unlike ''Philica'', Naboj is not a full-fledged online journal, but rather it provides an opportunity for users to write peer reviews of [[preprints]] at [[ArXiv.org e-print archive|arXiv.org]]. The review system is modeled on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and users have an opportunity to evaluate the reviews as well as the articles. That way, with a sufficient number of users and reviewers, there should be a convergence towards a higher quality review process. In February 2006, the journal ''[[Biology Direct]]''<ref>[http://www.biology-direct.com Biology Direct | Home page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was launched by [[Eugene Koonin]], Laura Landweber, and [[David Lipman]], providing another alternative to the traditional model of peer review. If authors can find three members of the Editorial Board who will each return a report or will themselves solicit an external review, then the article will be published. As with ''[[Philica]]'', reviewers cannot suppress publication, but in contrast to ''Philica'', no
