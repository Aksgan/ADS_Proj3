from their [[IAFIS]] — Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System. The FBI initially called it an "absolutely incontrovertible match". Subsequently, however, [[Spanish National Police]] examiners suggested that the print did not match Mayfield and after two weeks, identified another man whom they claimed the fingerprint ''did'' belong to. The [[FBI]] acknowledged their error, and a judge released Mayfield, who had spent two weeks in police custody, in May 2004.<ref name=MayfieldNYT/> In January 2006, a [[United States Justice Department|U.S. Justice Department]] report was released which criticized the FBI for sloppy work but exonerated them of some more serious allegations. The report found that the misidentification had been due to a misapplication of methodology by the examiners involved: Mayfield is an American-born convert<ref name=MayfieldNYT/> to [[Islam]] and his wife is an [[Egypt]]ian immigrant,<ref name=MayfieldNYT/> but these are not factors that should have affected fingerprint search technology. On 29 November 2006, the FBI agreed to pay Brandon Mayfield the sum of US$2 million in compensation.<ref name=MayfieldNYT/> The judicial settlement allowed Mayfield to continue a suit regarding certain other government practices surrounding his arrest and detention. The formal apology stated that the FBI, which erroneously linked him to the 2004 Madrid bombing through a fingerprinting mistake, had taken steps to "ensure that what happened to Mr Mayfield and the Mayfield family does not happen again."<ref name=MayfieldNYT/> ====René Ramón Sánchez==== René Ramón Sánchez, a legal [[Dominican Republic]] immigrant to the US was arrested on July 15, 1995, on a charge of [[Driving under the influence|driving while intoxicated]] (Driving Under the Influence, or DUI). His fingerprints, however, were placed on a card containing the name, [[Social Security number]] and other data for one Leo Rosario, who was being processed at the same time. Leo Rosario had been arrested for selling [[cocaine]] to an undercover police officer. On October 11, 2000, while returning from a visit to relatives in the [[Dominican Republic]], René was mis-identified as Leo Rosario at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York and arrested. Even though he did not match the physical description of Rosario, the erroneously-cataloged fingerprints were considered to be more reliable.<ref>[[New York Times]]; May 31, 2004; Can Prints Lie? Yes, Man Finds To His Dismay. In front of the immigration judge, the tall, muscular man began to weep. No, he had patiently tried to explain, he was not Leo Rosario, a drug dealer and a prime candidate for deportation. He was telling the truth. He was René Ramón Sánchez, an auto-body worker and merengue singer ...</ref> ====Shirley McKie==== [[Shirley McKie]] was a police detective in 1997 when she was accused of leaving her thumb print inside a house in [[Kilmarnock]], [[Scotland]] where Marion Ross had been murdered. Although McKie denied having been inside the house, she was arrested in a dawn raid the following year and charged with [[perjury]]. The only evidence the prosecution had was this thumb print allegedly found at the murder scene. Two American experts testified on her behalf at her trial in May 1999 and she was found [[acquittal|not guilty]]. The [[Scottish Criminal Record Office]] (SCRO) would not admit any error, however, although Scottish first minister [[Jack McConnell]] later said it had been an "honest mistake". On February 7, 2006, McKie was awarded [[Pound sterling|£]]750,000 in compensation from the [[Scottish Executive]] and the [[Scottish Criminal Record Office]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4689218.stm | work=BBC News | title='Relief' over fingerprint verdict | date=February 7, 2006}}</ref> Controversy continued to surround the McKie case and there was an ongoing [[public inquiry]] into the affair, as of November 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefingerprintinquiryscotland.org.uk/inquiry/CCC_FirstPage.jsp |title=The Fingerprint Inquiry Scotland }}</ref> ====Stephan Cowans==== Stephan Cowans was convicted of attempted murder in 1997 after he was accused of the shooting of a [[police officer]] whilst fleeing a robbery in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]]. He was implicated in the crime by the testimony of two witnesses, one of whom was the victim. There was also a fingerprint on a glass mug from which the assailant had drunk some water and experts testified that the fingerprint belonged to Cowans. He was found guilty and sent to prison for 35 years. Whilst in prison, Cowans earned money cleaning up biohazards until he could afford to have the evidence against him tested for [[DNA]]. The DNA did not match his and he was released. He had already served six years in prison. Stephen Cowans died on October 25, 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/10/man_wrongly_con.html |title=Man wrongly convicted in Boston police shooting found dead |first=David |last=Abel |date=2007-10-26 |publisher=The Boston Globe}}</ref> ==Privacy issues== ===Fingerprinting of children=== {{See|Biometrics in schools}} Various schools have implemented fingerprint locks or made a record of children's fingerprints.
