Various elements of the ''MW'', as well as other Gibbon writings not contained therein, are listed below along with their pertinent bibliographical detail and descriptive text where available. Notes and letters from Sheffield were also included in the ''MW'', but only Gibbon's writings follow here. Listed contents are exactly those from each volume's table as they appear in the ''Google''[тм] ''Books'' [http://books.google.com online] digitized copies. Links to those copies are provided below. Where publisher and year follows a work the reference is to the year of its first publication apart from the ''MW''.

Emerson, ed.] incomplete portions of six "drafts" lettered A-F. Sheffield aggressively edited both the ''Memoirs'' and the ''MW'' in order to reflect Gibbon's anti-French Revolutionary sentiment while also downplaying his connection with [[Edmund Burke]]'s eschatological interpretation; to prevent any further enlargement of Gibbon's reputation for harboring "irreligion" or atheism; and for other purposes of a more personal nature.<ref>Womersley, ''Watchmen'', at 235-236, 240, and 346-349.</ref> In 1966, Georges Bonnard published a composite collection chronologically arranged, "built on the same general lines" as Sheffield's, along with a thoroughly informative account of the historical background.<ref>Bonnard, ''Memoirs'', "Preface," vii-xxxiii, at xxxi. The manuscript originals are all contained, with one small exception, in the British Museum, Gibbon Papers, ''Add. MSS 34874'' (p. xiii). As to why Gibbon exercised six attempts to recount his life on paper, Bonnard opines that he was repeatedly dissatisfied with subject order and length. But from draft to draft, where Gibbon met with self-approval, he "very often contented himself with simply copying what he had already written."

Gibbon's first published work, an invaluable introduction to the ''Decline and Fall'', defends the ''érudits'' (antiquarian scholars) against French ''philosophes'' (especially [[Jean le Rond D'Alembert|D'Alembert]] in his ''Discours préliminaire à l'Encyclopédie'' [1751]) who had "contemptuously" assailed the ''érudits''<nowiki>'</nowiki> work as inferior, parochial, and effete. Gibbon recoiled at the charges, and strove to reconcile the two groups by "proving...that all the faculties of the mind may be exercised and displayed by [the] study of ancient litterature [sic]." The ''Essai'' was reviewed with "cold indifference" in England,<ref>Gibbon, ''Memoirs'', ¶"The design of my first work;" ¶"Two years elapsed in silence."</ref> but on the continent, it was met enthusiastically. In Paris, Gibbon was recognized as a man of letters.
