tunnel]], [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] mechanisms, or weights are used to apply the static or dynamic loading. Experimental determination of stresses can be carried out using, for example, the [[Photoelasticity|photoelastic method]] or [[dynamic mechanical analysis]]. ==Factor of safety== {{main|Factor of safety}} The factor of safety is a design requirement for the structure based on the uncertainty in loads, material strength, and consequences of failure. In design of structures, calculated stresses are restricted to be less than an specified allowable stress, also known as working or designed stress, that is chosen as some fraction of the [[yield strength]] or of the [[ultimate strength]] of the material which the structure is made of. The ratio of the ultimate stress to the allowable stress is defined as the factor of safety. Laboratory test are usually performed on material samples in order to determine the yield strength and the ultimate strength that the material can withstand before failure. Often a separate factor of safety is applied to the yield strength and to the ultimate strength. The factor of safety on yield strength is to prevent detrimental deformations and the factor of safety on ultimate strength is to prevent collapse. The factor of safety is used to calculate a maximum allowable stress: :<math>\text{Factor of safety} = \frac{\text{Ultimate tensile strength}}{\text{Maximum allowable stress}}</math> "Margin of safety" or "design factor" are other ways to express the factor of safety value. . ==Load transfer== The evaluation of loads and stresses within structures is directed to finding the load transfer path. Loads will be transferred by physical contact between the various component parts and within structures. The load transfer may be identified visually, or by simple logic for simple structures. For more complex structures, more complex methods such as theoretical [[solid mechanics]] or by numerical methods may be required. Numerical methods include [[direct stiffness method]] which is also referred to as the [[finite element method]]. The object is to determine the critical stresses in each part, and compare them to the strength of the material (see [[strength of materials]]). For parts that have broken in service, a [[forensic engineering]] or [[failure analysis]] is performed to identify weakness, where broken parts are analysed for the cause or causes of failure. The method seeks to identify the weakest component in the load path. If this is the part which actually failed, then it may corroborate independent evidence of the failure. If not, then another explanation has to be sought, such as a defective part with a lower [[tensile strength]] than it should for example. ==Uniaxial stress== If two of the dimensions of the object are very large or very small compared to the others, the object may be modelled as one-dimensional. In this case the stress tensor has only one component and is indistinguishable from a scalar. One-dimensional objects include a piece of wire loaded at the ends and a metal sheet loaded on the face and viewed up close and through the cross section. When a structural element is subjected to tension or compression its length will tend to elongate or shorten, and its cross-sectional area changes by an amount that depends on the [[Poisson's ratio]] of the material. In engineering applications, structural members experience small deformations and the reduction in cross-sectional area is very small and can be neglected, i.e., the cross-sectional area is assumed constant during deformation. For this case, the stress is called ''engineering stress'' or ''nominal stress''. In some other cases, e.g., [[elastomer]]s and [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] materials, the change in cross-sectional area is significant, and the stress must be calculated assuming the current cross-sectional area instead of the initial cross-sectional area. This is termed ''true stress'' and is expressed as :<math>\sigma_\mathrm{true} = (1 + \varepsilon_\mathrm e)(\sigma_\mathrm e)\,\!</math>, where :<math>\varepsilon_\mathrm e\,\!</math> is the nominal (engineering) [[strain (materials science)|strain]], and :<math>\sigma_\mathrm e\,\!</math> is nominal (engineering) stress. The relationship between true strain and engineering strain is given by :<math>\varepsilon_\mathrm{true} = \ln(1 + \varepsilon_\mathrm e)\,\!</math>. In uniaxial tension, true stress is then greater than nominal stress. The converse holds in compression. ==Plane stress== [[Image:Plane stress.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 7.1 Plane stress state in a continuum.]] A state of ''plane stress'' exists when one of the three principal <math>\left(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3 \right)\,\!</math>, stresses is zero. This usually occurs in structural elements where one dimension is very small compared to the other two, i.e. the element is flat or thin. In this case, the stresses are negligible with respect to the smaller dimension as they are not able to develop within the material and are small compared to the in-plane stresses. Therefore, the face of the element is not acted by loads and the structural element can be analyzed as two-dimensional, e.g. thin-walled structures such as plates subject to in-plane loading or thin cylinders subject to pressure loading. The other three non-zero components remain constant over the thickness of the plate. The stress tensor can then be approximated by: : <math>\sigma_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} & 0 \\ \sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \equiv \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{x} & \tau_{xy} & 0 \\ \tau_{yx} & \sigma_{y} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\,\!</math>. The corresponding strain tensor is: : <math>\varepsilon_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{11} & \varepsilon_{12} & 0 \\ \varepsilon_{21} & \varepsilon_{22} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \varepsilon_{33}\end{bmatrix}\,\!</math> in which the non-zero <math>\varepsilon_{33}\,\!</math> term arises from the [[Poisson's ratio|Poisson's effect]]. This strain term can be temporarily removed from the stress analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the analysis to two dimensions. {{Clear}} ==Plane strain== [[Image:Plane strain.svg|600px|right|thumb|Figure 7.2 Plane strain state in a continuum.]] {{main|Infinitesimal strain theory}} If one dimension is very large compared to the others, the [[Strain (materials science)|principal strain]] in the direction of the longest dimension is constrained and can be assumed as zero, yielding a plane strain condition (Figure 7.2). In this case, though all principal stresses are non-zero, the principal stress in the direction of the longest dimension can be disregarded for calculations. Thus, allowing a two dimensional analysis of stresses, e.g. a
