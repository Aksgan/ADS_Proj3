westward as far as the Ocean. The King's court was kept in the city of Ghanah, which, according to the author of the Book of Roger (El Idrisi), and the author of the Book of Roads and Realms (El Bekri), is divided into two parts, standing on both banks of the Nile, and ranks among the largest and most populous cities of the world. The people of Ghanah had for neighbours, on the east, a nation, which, according to historians, was called Susu; after which came another named Mali; and after that another known by the name of Kaukau ; although some people prefer a different orthography, and write this name Kagho. The last-named nation was followed by a people called Tekrur. The people of Ghanah declined in course of time, being overwhelmed or absorbed by the Molaththemun (or muffled people;that is, the Morabites), who, adjoining them on the north towards the Berber country, attacked them, and, taking possession of their territory, compelled them to embrace the Mohammedan religion. The people of Ghanah, being invaded at a later period by the Susu, a nation of Blacks in their neighbourhood, were exterminated, or mixed with other Black nations.''"</ref> Ibn Khaldun suggests a link between the decline of Ghana and rise of the Almoravids.

Like Montesquieu, Ibn Khaldun studied "the physical environment in which man lives in order to understand how it influences him in his non-physical characteristics." He explained the differences between different peoples, whether [[nomad]]ic or [[sedentary]] peoples, including their customs and institutions, in terms of their "physical environment-habitat, climate, soil, food, and the different ways in which they are forced to satisfy their needs and obtain a living." This was a departure from the climatic theories expressed by authors from [[Hippocrates]] to [[Jean Bodin]]. It has been suggested that Ibn Khaldun may have had an influence upon Montesquieu's theory through the traveller [[Jean Chardin]], who travelled to Persia and described a theory resembling Ibn Khaldun's climatic theory.<ref>{{citation|title=The Spread of Ibn Khaldun's Ideas on Climate and Culture|author=Warren E.

[[Clark University]] professor [[Ellen Churchill Semple]] is credited with introducing the theory to the United States after studying with human geographer [[Friedrich Ratzel]] in [[Germany]]. The prominence of determinism was influenced by the high profile of [[evolutionary biology]], although it tended more to resemble the now-discredited [[Lamarckism]] rather than [[Darwinism]]. ==Waning and Legacy== Between 1920 and 1940, environmental determinism came under repeated attacks as its claims were found to be severely faulted at best, and often dangerously wrong. Geographers reacted to this by first developing the softer notion of "environmental [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]]," and later by abandoning the search for theory and causal explanation for many decades. Later critics charged that determinism served to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]]. The experience of environmental determinism has left a scar on geography, with many geographers reacting negatively to any suggestion of environmental influences on human society. While this accurately reflects the popular belief and perception in the geographic community towards environmental determinism, the debate was overlaid with hues of gray. Rostlund pointed out in his essay in ''Readings in Cultural Geography'': "Environmentalism was not disproved, only disapproved." He also points to the fact that the disapproval was not based on inaccurate findings, but rather a methodological process which stands in contrast to that of science, something the geographers have arguably sought to ascribe themselves to. [[Carl O. Sauer]] followed on from this in 1924 when he criticized the premature generalizations resulting from the bias of environmentalism. He pointed out that to define geography as the study of environmental influences is to assume in advance that such influences do operate, and that a science cannot be based upon or committed to a preconception." A variant of environmental determinism was popular among [[Marxists]], employing the [[dialectical materialism]] concept of history. To [[Marx]]'s basic model of the ideological and cultural superstructure being determined by the economic base, they added the idea that the economic base is determined by environmental conditions. For example, Russian geographer [[Georgi Plekhanov]] argued that the reason his nation was still in the [[feudal]] era, rather than having progressed to [[capitalism]] and becoming ripe for the revolution into [[communism]], was that the wide plains of Russia allowed class conflicts to be easily diffused. This Marxist environmental determinism was repudiated around the same time as classic environmental determinism. ==Subsets== ===Climatic=== Climatic determinism is an aspect of [[economic geography]], also sometimes called the ''equatorial paradox''. According to this theory, about 70% of the economic development of a country can be predicted from the distance between that country and the [[equator]]. In other words, the further from the equator the more developed a country tends to be. The paradox applies equally well both north and south of the equator. Australia, for example, has a higher level of economic development than Indonesia. The paradox also applies within countries — the northern U.S. states are more developed than the southern U.S. states. [[Singapore]] is a notable counter-example: it is located at 1.22° N and is one of the world's most prosperous countries. This prosperity is based on its position as a port. Other exceptions to the paradox tend to have large natural resources. [[Saudi Arabia]] is a good example. One popular
