The turn of the millennium witnessed the growth of [[Internet]]<!--The Internet, propernoun--> based technologies which resulted in the [[dotcom boom]]. Bangalore's IT industry grew during this period with the establishment of local and foreign IT companies. In 2001, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' published an article entitled "India's Silicon Valley" which traced the growth of the IT industry in India and particularly in Bangalore. The use of the term "Silicon Valley of India" to refer to Bangalore grew in local media and as time progressed, in international media too. An article entitled "Is the Next Silicon Valley Taking Root in Bangalore?" appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 2006<ref name=nyt>Rai, Saritha.

It can be used as a [[standalone software|stand-alone]] application, as a [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], or as a universal [[TWAIN]] module. Versions include: * SilverFast SE<ref>Sally Wiener Grotta and Daniel Grotta, [http://www.macworld.com/article/142438/2009/08/silverfast.html "With SilverFast SE, your scans look more like the originals,"] ''[[Macworld]]'' August 25, 2009, reprinted from ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]''.</ref> and SE Plus (beginners / with [[Multi-Exposure]]) * SilverFast Ai and Ai Studio (professional and expert users) * SilverFast Ai IT8 and Ai Studio IT8 (incorporating [[IT8]]-target for [[ICC profile|ICC profiling]]) * SilverFast X-Ray (a special version of SilverFast Ai designed to digitize [[Radiography|radiographic films]] for scientific and medical radiography) === SilverFast DC === [[Image:SilverFast DC Pro.png|thumb|250px|Screenshot: SilverFast DC Pro]] SilverFast DC is a [[standalone software|stand-alone]] software solution for digital camera image processing. It contains features for reading the image data from the camera, for processing, optimizing, and archiving the images on the computer, as well as for printing the edited images. * SilverFast DC SE - for Beginners * SilverFast DC Pro - for Professionals * SilverFast DC Pro Studio - for Experts * SilverFast DC VLT - the Virtual Light Table All DC versions include a virtual [[light table]] for organizing, managing, and manipulating the images (for example [[color temperature]] regulation, [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] adjustment, and [[Red-eye effect|red-eye]] correction). The user can create photo archives and albums, add comments to images, generate [[Contact print|contact sheets]] of the complete view port, and produce or print single pictures in high resolution and in variable sizes. SilverFast DC Pro has the functionality of the scanner-software SilverFast Ai for digital images. Supported are the standard image formats like [[JPEG]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], but also the unprocessed [[raw image format]]. Because of [[high dynamic range]], raw images are an ideal base for image processing. The access to the raw data permits manual color correction or sharpening instead of using the camera's automatic adjustment, which often does not work perfectly. SilverFast DC supports [[Digital Negative (file format)|Adobe DNG]] and many camera models by the most popular manufacturers, some of them optimized by special camera profiles.<ref name=DC_camera_list/> With the included [[IT8]]-target, individual [[ICC profile]]s can be self-made for every camera. SilverFast DC Pro contains additional features like the automated color optimization AACO, support for [[JPEG 2000]], unsharpmasking USMPlus, CloneTool, and an improved PrinTao module with text and layout functions. === SilverFast HDR === SilverFast HDR ([[High dynamic range imaging|High Dynamic Range]]) is a software for processing 48-bit [[Raw image format|RAW images]].
