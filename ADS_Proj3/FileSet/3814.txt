The links of such a manipulator are connected by joints allowing either rotational motion (such as in an [[articulated robot]]) or translational (linear) displacement.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iv/otm_iv_4.html OSHA Technical Manual]</ref><ref>[http://www.ssl.umd.edu/projects/rangertsx/data/spacerobotics-UNDSPST470.pdf Paper on Space Robotics, pg 9]</ref> The links of the manipulator can be considered to form a [[kinematic chain]]. The business end of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is called the [[end effector]] and it is analogous to the human [[hand]]. The end effector can be designed to perform any desired task such as welding, gripping, spinning etc., depending on the application. For example robot arms in [[automotive]] [[assembly line]]s perform a variety of tasks such as [[welding]] and parts rotation and placement during assembly. In [[Outer space|space]] the [[Space Shuttle]] Remote Manipulator System also known as [[Canadarm]] or [[SSRMS]] and its successor [[Canadarm2]] are examples of multi [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degree of freedom]] robotic arms that have been used to perform a variety of tasks such as inspections of the Space Shuttle using a specially deployed boom with cameras and [[sensor]]s attached at the end effector and [[satellite]] deployment and retrieval manoeuvres from the [[cargo bay]] of the Space Shuttle.<ref name="IEEE">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/9317/29659/01347668.pdf IEEE Xplore:The Canadarm grasps this boom and can position it in the necessary positions to permit a complete inspection ]</ref> The robot arms can be [[autonomous robot|autonomous]] or controlled manually and can be used to perform a variety of tasks with great accuracy. The robotic arm can be fixed or mobile (i.e. wheeled) and can be designed for [[Industrial robots|industrial]] or home applications. ==Types== [[Image:Industrial robots-transparent.gif|right|thumb|250px|6 Axis Articulated Robots from [[KUKA]]]] '''*[[Cartesian robot]] / Gantry robot''':Used for pick and place work, application of sealant, assembly operations, handling machine tools and arc welding.

A robotic scanner usually consists of three basic parts: a mechanical device to turn the pages; a cradle or table to hold the book in place, and a camera or imaging sensor to capture images. Images are then automatically shuttled to a central computer repository, where automated processing may take place in order to perform cropping, de-skewing, and other image enhancement functions. During the process, the book remains intact. Several high-end commercial robotic scanners use traditional air and suction technology while others take advantage of optical sensor technology to separate and turn pages one at a time. ==External links== * [http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/dlp/bookscanning/ Robotic Book Scanning at Stanford] * [http://www.geocities.jp/takascience/lego/fabs_en.html How to Make a Full Auto Book Scanner] * [http://www.roboticbookscan.com Qidenus Technologies - QiScan RBSpro robotic bookscanner] * [http://www.treventus.com/bookscanner_pageturner.html Treventus - Robotic bookscanner ScanRobot] * [http://www.kirtas.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69&Itemid=88 Kirtas Technologies KABIS III Robotic Book Scanner] {{tech-stub}} [[Category:Robotics|Book scanner]] [[Category:Digital libraries]] [[Category:Computing input devices]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32320</id> <title>Robotic telescope</title> <text>{{refimprove|date=February 2010}} [[Image:El Enano robotic telescope.jpg|thumb|300px|“El Enano”, a robotic telescope]] A '''robotic telescope''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[telescope]] and detector system that makes [[observation]]s without the intervention of a [[human]]. In astronomical disciplines, a telescope qualifies as [[robot]]ic if it makes those observations without being operated by a human, even if a human has to initiate the observations at the beginning of the night, or end them in the morning. A robotic telescope is distinct from a [[remote telescope]], though an instrument can be both robotic and remote. ==Design== Robotic telescopes are complex systems that typically incorporate a number of subsystems. These subsystems include devices that provide telescope pointing capability, operation of the detector (typically a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera), control of the dome or telescope enclosure, control over the telescope's [[Focus (optics)|focuser]], detection of [[weather]] conditions, and other capabilities. Frequently these varying subsystems are presided over by a master control system,
