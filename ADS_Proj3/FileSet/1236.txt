In the last story, Eggman aids Sonic in trying to stop a [[fail-safe]] put in place by his grandfather, [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Professor Gerald Robotnik|Gerald Robotnik]], which would set the colony on a crash course with Earth.<ref>'''Doctor Eggman:''' The core of the Eclipse Cannon is now highly reactive and explosive. This is because of the energy of the Chaos Emeralds if overpowering it. If the colony collides with Earth, it will shatter into pieces like my grandfather predicted! [...] There still may be time left. If we pull together, we might be able to get to the shortcut that leads to the core! [[Sega]] ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' ''(in English)'' 2001-[[June 19|6-19]] ''(US)''</ref> In ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', Eggman is captured by his own creation, [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Metal Sonic|Metal Sonic]], who disguises himself as Eggman as part of a larger evil plan. In ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', Eggman is an opportunist who tries to gather the Chaos Emeralds in the middle of the alien invasion. He ends up sending his robots to help stop the alien menace in the end. As Shadow interrogates Eggman for information regarding his past, he is met with taunts from Eggman, who claims that Shadow is one of his [[Shadow the Hedgehog#Shadow Androids|android]]s.<ref>'''Shadow the Hedgehog:''' Yes, doctor, you will regret ever having created me. You're going straight to Hell! '''Eggman:''' Why you little... You're nothing but pieces of scrap metal! Once I'm done with you, you'll be thrown in the junkyard!

This might be the last chance I have to speak to you, so... What I said, about having created you... it was all a lie. Everyone thought you died during that horrible incident... but I rescued you, with one of my robots... You lost your memory, that's all... You really are the Ultimate Life Form my grandfather created! [[Sega]] ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' ''(in English'' 2005-11-15 ''(US)''</ref> In the 2006 ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game, Dr. Eggman (who had a realistic human appearance) kidnaps the princess of Soleanna, who harbors the Flames of Disaster within her, in order to control time. Once again, he is forced to assist the heroes during the last act, much like previous games. Eggman also appears in ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' as [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahryār]] of [[Persia]]. Here, his physical appearance has been changed back to his ''Adventure'' look.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Secret Rings'' character concept art |url=http://www.sonicstadium.org/imagebin/articles/previews/satsr1_02.jpg |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> Eggman appeared in [[Sonic Rush]] and [[Sonic Rush Adventure]], where he is once again a main villain, alongside a parallel version of himself called [[Eggman Nega]]. He is also a playable character in the Sonic RPG, [[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]]. In ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'', Dr. Eggman is one of the two main villains in the game, along with Dark Gaia. Eggman tricks Super Sonic into a trap and uses his energy to power a giant laser cannon, which fires into the Earth and shatters it into pieces, freeing the beast contained within; Dark Gaia. He spends most of the game collecting Dark Gaia's power as well as fighting Sonic with various machines, and much like the original games, flies off in his Egg Mobile when defeated. Unlike many previous games, Eggman actually assumes control of his plans at the end of ''Sonic Unleashed'' by creating Eggmanland and makes no effort to join forces with Sonic to stop his own plans once they have spiraled out of control. Still, Eggman suffers a defeat when he gives Dark Gaia a single order and is shot into the atmosphere by the creature. In ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'', Sonic goes traveling on his own, not knowing Eggman survived their last encounter in ''[[Sonic and Knuckles]]''. The doctor revisits his old badniks, and improves them to destroy his old rival once and for all. He has also made an appearance as a boss. In [[Sonic Colors]], Eggman claims to be seeking forgiveness for his past transgressions, and attempts to make amends by opening up a theme park within the Earth's orbit. However, it becomes clear that the park is merely a front for Eggman's true intentions, which involve harnessing the energies of the alien Wisps for his own use. In ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'', a [[pinball]]-themed game, Dr. Robotnik seizes Mount Mobius and turns it into a mechanical base, setting up an elaborate pinball mechanism to keep the Chaos Emeralds safe. Robotnik has also appeared in "2.5D" isometric platformers; in ''[[Sonic Labyrinth]]'', he secretly replaces Sonic's famous red shoes with the new "Slow-Down Boots," which take away his ability to jump or run fast, and in ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'', he turns innocent Flickies into robots in yet another search for the Chaos Emeralds. Dr. Eggman is also a playable character in such games as ''[[Sonic Drift]]'', ''[[Sonic R]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', ''[[Sonic Riders]]'' and its sequel ''[[Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity]]'', ''[[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]]'', ''[[Sega Superstars Tennis]]'', and [[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]. Eggman appears as a playable character in the crossover game ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]''. Dr. Eggman made a cameo appearance in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' as a trophy. He appeared as a playable character in ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'', also as one of the two main villains (alongside [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]) in the game's Adventure Mode ([[Nintendo DS|DS]] version only). Eggman and Bowser plan to make their own Olympic Winter Games by kidnapping the Star Spirits. In the game's climax, the two villains act as the final bosses. The only
