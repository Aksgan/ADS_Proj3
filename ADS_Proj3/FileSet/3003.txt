degree <math>n-1</math> with leading coefficient <math>\tfrac1{(n-1)!}</math>. For example, the number of monomials in three variables (<math>n=3</math>) of degree ''d'' is <math>\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)^{\overline2} = \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)(d+2)</math>; these numbers form the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... of [[triangular number]]s. ==Notation== Notation for monomials is constantly required in fields like [[partial differential equation]]s. If the variables being used form an indexed family like <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, <math>x_3</math>, ..., then ''[[multi-index notation]]'' is helpful: if we write :<math>\alpha = (a, b, c)</math> we can define :<math>x^{\alpha} = x_1^a\, x_2^b\, x_3^c</math> and save a great deal of space. ==Geometry== In [[algebraic geometry]] the varieties defined by monomial equations <math>x^{\alpha} = 0</math> for some set of α have special properties of homogeneity. This can be phrased in the language of [[algebraic group]]s, in terms of the existence of a [[group action]] of an [[algebraic torus]] (equivalently by a multiplicative group of [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]]). This area is studied under the name of ''[[Toric geometry|torus embedding]]s''. ==See also== * [[monomial representation]] * [[generalized permutation matrix|monomial matrix]] * [[homogeneous polynomial]] * [[homogeneous function]] * [[multilinear form]] == Notes == {{Reflist}} [[Category:Homogeneous polynomials]] [[Category:Algebra]] [[az:Birhədli]] [[bg:Моном]] [[ca:Monomi]] [[cs:Monom]] [[de:Monom]] [[et:Üksliige]] [[es:Monomio]] [[fa:تک‌جمله‌ای]] [[fr:Monôme (mathématiques)]] [[io:Monomio]] [[it:Monomio]] [[lv:Monoms]] [[lt:Vienanaris]] [[lmo:Munomi]] [[hu:Monom]] [[ml:ഏകപദം]] [[nl:Eenterm]] [[pl:Jednomian]] [[pt:Monômio]] [[fi:Monomi]] [[sv:Monom]] [[th:เอกนาม]] [[zh:单项式]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25045</id> <title>Monowave Corp.</title> <text>'''Monowave''' is a small research company located in [[Seattle, Washington]], primarily involved in research on machine [[speech recognition]]. The firm was founded by [[Elaine Tsiang]] and [[Hugh Everett III]] to study "human-machine parallels", and became focused on hearing and speech in the early 1990s. Their '''HERO''' [[neural network]] system simulates the human auditory system in order to track sounds in a noisy background, based on the assumption that the human system has evolved to be good at this. HERO is a server-based system with any number of applications. To date the company has based two systems on HERO, one for identifying pitch which can transcribe music from noisy recordings, and another for speech recognition. ==External links== *[http://www.ihear.com iHear] {{US-company-stub}} [[Category:Speech recognition]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25059</id> <title>Monte Carlo method for photon transport</title> <text>Modeling photon propagation with [[Monte Carlo method]]s is a flexible yet rigorous approach to simulate photon transport. In the method, local rules of photon transport are expressed as probability distributions which describe the step size of photon movement between sites of photon-tissue interaction and the angles of deflection in a photon's trajectory when a scattering event occurs. This is equivalent to modeling photon transport analytically by the [[Radiative transfer equation and diffusion theory for photon transport in biological tissue|radiative transfer equation]] (RTE), which describes the motion of photons using a differential equation. However, closed-form solutions of the RTE are often not possible; for some geometries, the [[Radiative transfer equation and diffusion theory for photon transport in biological tissue|diffusion approximation]] can be used to simplify the RTE, although this, in turn, introduces many inaccuracies, especially near sources and boundaries. In contrast, Monte Carlo simulations can be made arbitrarily accurate by increasing the number of photons traced. For example, see the movie, where a Monte Carlo simulation of a [[pencil beam]] incident on a [[semi-infinite]] medium models both the initial ballistic photon flow and the later diffuse propagation. The Monte Carlo method is necessarily statistical and therefore requires significant computation time to achieve precision. In addition Monte Carlo simulations can keep track of multiple physical quantities simultaneously, with any desired spatial and temporal resolution. This flexibility makes Monte Carlo modeling a powerful tool. Thus, while computationally inefficient, Monte Carlo methods are often considered the standard for simulated measurements of photon transport for many biomedical applications. [[Image:MonteCarloSemiInf.gif|thumb|right|Monte Carlo simulation of a pencil beam incident on a semi-infinite scattering medium.]] ==Biomedical applications of Monte Carlo methods== ===Biomedical imaging=== The optical properties of biological tissue offer an exciting approach to biomedical imaging. There are many interesting endogenous contrasts, including absorption from blood and melanin and scattering from nerve cells and cancer cell nuclei. In addition, fluorescent probes can be targeted to many different tissues. Microscopy techniques (including [[Confocal microscopy|confocal]], [[Two-photon excitation microscopy|two-photon]], and [[optical coherence tomography]]) have the ability to image these properties with high spatial resolution, but, since they rely on ballistic photons, their depth penetration is limit to a few millimeters. Imaging deeper into tissues, where photons have been multiply scattered, requires a deeper understanding of the statistical behavior of large numbers of photons in such an environment. Monte Carlo methods provide a flexible framework that has been used by different techniques to reconstruct optical properties deep within tissue. A brief introduction to a few of these techniques is presented here. *[[Photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine|Photoacoustic tomography]] In PAT, diffuse laser light is absorbed which generates a local temperature rise. This local temperature variation in turn generates ultrasound waves via thermoelastic expansion which are detected via an ultrasonic transducer. In practice, a variety of setup parameters are varied (i.e. light wavelength, transducer numerical aperture) and as a result Monte Carlo modeling is a valuable tool for predicting tissue response prior to experimental methods. *[[Diffuse optical imaging|Diffuse optical tomography]] DOT is an imaging technique that uses an array of near-infrared light sources and detectors to measure optical properties of biological tissues. A variety of contrasts can be measured including the absorption due to oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (for functional neuro-imaging or cancer detection) and the concentration of fluorescent probes. In order to reconstruct an image, one must know the manner in which light traveled from a given source to a given detector and how the measurement depends on the distribution and changes in the optical properties (known as the forward model). Due to the highly scattering nature of biological tissue, such paths are complicated and the sensitivity functions are diffuse. The forward model is often generated using Monte Carlo methods. ===Radiation therapy=== The goal of [[radiation therapy]] is to deliver energy, generally in the form of ionizing radiation, to cancerous tissue while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. Monte carlo modeling is commonly employed in radiation therapy to determine the peripheral dose the patient
