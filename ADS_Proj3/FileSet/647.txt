not use the term, Tönu Puu (1989) presented a multiplier-accelerator business cycle model with a cubic accelerator function that exhibited the phenomenon. Other conscious applications of the concept have included to Rayleigh-Bénard convection rolls, hysteretic scaling for ferromagnetism, and a pendulum on a rotating table (Berglund and Kunz, 1999), to induction motors (Súto and Nagy, 2000), to combinatorial optimization in integer programming (Wataru and Eitaro, 2001), to isotropic magnetization (Hauser, 2004), to bursting oscillations in beta cells in the pancreas and population dynamics (Françoise and Piquet, 2005), to thermal convection (Vadasz, 2006), and to [[neural networks]] (Liu and Xiu, 2007). ==References== *Ralph H.

Caslione]] of GCS Business Capital, LLC. Based on the concept that the world economy has entered into a new economic era of [[uncertainty]], '''Chaotics''' provides methods to allow companies to live with increased [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] in an age of heightened [[turbulence]] and its consequent [[chaos]]. This involves creating and implementing a set of new strategic behaviors defined by [[Kotler]] and [[Caslione]] as well as building an early warning system, a scenario construction system, and a quick response system to manage and market during recessions and other turbulent economic conditions. According to [[Kotler]] and [[Caslione]] in their book with entitled, ''Chaotics: The Business of Managing and Marketing in The Age of Turbulence'' (AMACOM Publishing; May 2009), [[globalization]] and [[technology]] are the two main forces have created a new level of ''interlocking fragility'' in the world economy. As a result, the world economy has entered a new era marked increasingly frequent and intermittent periods of [[turbulence]] in what is termed, ''the new normality'', a new normal condition in the global economy which one of continuous and unpredictable turbulence that is punctuated by periodic and intermittent spurts of prosperity and downturn—including extended downturns amounting to [[recession]], or even [[Economic depression|depression]]. [[Turbulence]] has two major effects on business enterprises. One is [[vulnerability]], against which companies need defensive armor. The other is [[opportunity]], which needs to be exploited. This new period of heightened [[turbulence]] and [[chaos]] creates the need for businesses to develop a new mindset, one that takes into account intermittent and unpredictable periods of [[disturbance]], to allow them to thrive under the constant threat of economic and business [[chaos]]. '''Chaotics''' helps businesses and organizations to: * detect sources of turbulence * prepare scenarios to respond to turbulence's chaos * predict chaos-induced vulnerabilities and opportunities * develop responses to ensure long-term resilience and success * avoid risk while advancing the interests of the company * build flexibility into the balance sheet, budgets and strategy implementation and execution cycles * price strategically and with flexibility * adjust products to meet new, fast-changing customer values * develop ''modulated strategy'' to adjust real-time with turbulence and the fast-changing environment [[Kotler]] and [[Caslione]] proclaim that companies must plan now for an economy that will no longer ebb and flow like the smooth upward rising sine waves of the past, but rather will look like the choppy spikes of a heartbeat in an EKG, i.e., the ''new normality''. The ''Chaotics Management System'' includes new ''Chaotics Strategic Behaviors'' for hedging risk and confronting uncertainty to help businesses navigate through turbulence rather than being caught up in it. '''Chaotics''' represents a new platform-and a new set of strategic behaviors-designed to help businesses to be successful and profitable over the extended term, thus attaining and preserving ''Business Enterprise Sustainability'' regardless of the economic conditions, including [[turbulence]] and heightened [[turbulence]]. To facilitate the global development and execution of the ''Chaotics Management System'', in 2009 Chaotics, LLC, was founded by ''Chaotics'' co-author [[John Caslione]].
