Visual's slogan was "See for yourself". It merged with [[White Pine Software]] in 1993, which became CU-SeeMe Networks, in turn absorbed into RadVision in 2001. The computer consists of a [[Computer display|monitor]] which is the main computer and a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]. The computer was used as a [[computer terminal]] so there are no internal drives or [[daughter card]]s. The only computer component in the case is a [[motherboard]] with a modem port, keyboard port, and an aux. port. [[Termcap]] provides support for the Visual 50 by way of the entries named v50, vi50, v50am, or visual50, depending on the system. The computer uses on an SGS (now [[STMicroelectronics]]) Z8400AB1 [[CPU]], based on the [[Zilog]] [[Z80A]] CPU. This CPU has an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus, and runs at 4 MHz. The keyboard is a [[Keytronic]] A65-0248, attached by a 4 wire telephone cord. The keyboard uses an [[Intel 8048|Intel P8048H]] MCU, a common [[MCU]] for keyboards.

It is derived from [[FoxPro 2|FoxPro]] (originally known as '''FoxBASE''') which was developed by Fox Software beginning in 1984. Fox Technologies merged with Microsoft in 1992, after which the software acquired further features and the prefix "Visual". The last version of [[FoxPro 2|FoxPro (2.6)]] worked under [[Mac OS]], [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[Unix]]: Visual FoxPro 3.0, the first "Visual" version, reduced platform support to only Mac and Windows, and later versions were Windows-only. The current version of Visual FoxPro is [[Component Object Model|COM]]-based and Microsoft has stated that they do not intend to create a [[Microsoft .NET]] version. FoxPro originated as a member of the class of languages commonly referred to as [[XBase|"xBase"]] languages, which have syntax based on the [[DBASE|dBase]] programming language. Other members of the xBase language family include [[Clipper programming language|Clipper]] and [[Recital (database)|Recital]]. (A history of the early years of xBase can be found in the [[dBase#Origins|dBase]] article.) Visual FoxPro, commonly abbreviated as VFP, is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine, which extends FoxPro's xBase capabilities to support [[SQL]] query and data manipulation. Unlike most [[database management systems]], Visual FoxPro is a full-featured, [[dynamic programming language]] that does not require the use of an additional general-purpose programming environment. It can be used to write not just traditional "[[fat client]]" applications, but also [[middleware]] and [[web application]]s. == Recent history == In late 2002, it was demonstrated that Visual FoxPro can run on [[Linux]] under the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] Windows compatibility suite. In 2003, this led to complaints by Microsoft: it was claimed that the deployment of runtime FoxPro code on non-Windows machines violates the [[End User License Agreement]].<ref>[http://fox.wikis.com/wc.dll?Wiki~VFPandLinux VFP and Linux - Visual FoxPro Wiki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In December 2005, VFP broke into the top 20 on [[Tiobe index]]<ref>[http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/paperinfo/tpci/FoxPro_xBase.html Tiobe Index History for FoxPro]</ref> for the first time. In March 2007 it was at position 19, making it a "B" language. As of August, 2010, VFP (combined with xBase) is at position 25. In March 2007, Microsoft announced that there will be no VFP 10<ref name="eolannouncement">[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb308952.aspx A Message to the Community]</ref>, thus making VFP9 (released to manufacturing on December 17, 2004) the last commercial VFP release from Microsoft. The support of Version 9 is ongoing with service packs that were released December 8, 2005 and October 11, 2007. At the time of
