Eventually, Lithtech Triton's new features were merged back into Lithtech Jupiter for licensees. === Lithtech Jupiter EX === As of 2005 the latest iteration of the Lithtech engine was Jupiter Extended (or Jupiter EX for short), which was featured in ''[[F.E.A.R. (computer game)|F.E.A.R.]]'' and ''[[Condemned: Criminal Origins]]''<ref name="fear">{{cite web | url=http://ixbtlabs.com/articles2/video/tech_fear.html | title=Graphics Technologies in Games: F.E.A.R | date=2006-10-20 | publisher=ixbtlabs.com | quote=''When Lithtech 1.0 was released, it couldn't compare with more famous engines like Quake and Unreal.

Compared to its precursor Jupiter, the Extended version was driven by a new DirectX 9 renderer and has seen some other major advancements, including the addition of [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics to simulate realistic physics. Along with Havok's character dynamics, Jupiter EX includes also the "Havok Vehicle Kit", which adds support for common vehicle behavior. ==Games using Lithtech== The following is a partial list of [[video game]]s built with the Lithtech engine, arranged by the version of Lithtech used.
