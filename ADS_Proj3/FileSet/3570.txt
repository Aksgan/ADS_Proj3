algebra of semantic objects. The Principle of Compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics of the Actor model#Compositionality_in_programming_languages|compositionality of programming languages]]. == Critiques == The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[analytic]] truth, obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The principle has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. The principle of compositionality, then, has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. ==See also== *[[Componential analysis]] *[[Formal semantics]] *[[Initial algebra]] *[[Referential transparency (computer science)]] ==External links== * {{sep entry|compositionality|Compositionality|Zoltán Gendler Szabó}} * [http://www.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/thphil/compositionality/ Anthologies on compositionality] * [http://www.science-digital.com/Ontos/samples/O-Werning-Compositionality-S.pdf Overview] {{philosophy of language}} [[Category:Semantics]] [[Category:Principles]] [[Category:Philosophy of language]] [[de:Frege-Prinzip]] [[es:Principio de composicionalidad]] [[it:Composizionalità]] [[hu:Kompozicionalitás]] [[sv:Kompositionalitetsprincipen]] [[zh:复合性原理]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29952</id> <title>Principle of distributivity</title> <text>The '''principle of distributivity''' states that the algebraic [[distributive law]] is [[validity|valid]] for [[classical logic]], where both [[logical conjunction]] and [[logical disjunction]] are distributive over each other so that for any [[proposition]]s ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]]s :<math>A \land (B \lor C) \iff (A \land B) \lor (A \land C)</math> and :<math>A \lor (B \land C) \iff (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)</math> hold. The principle of distributivity is valid in [[classical logic]], but invalid in [[quantum logic]]. The article ''[[Is logic empirical?]]'' discusses the case that quantum logic is the correct, empirical logic, on the grounds that the principle of distributivity is [[consistency|inconsistent]] with a reasonable [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum phenomena]].

It is typically situated in the same section as the [[break key]] and [[scroll lock]] key. The print screen may share the same key as [[system request]]. ==Original use== Under [[Command line interface|command-line]] based [[operating system]]s such as [[MS-DOS]], this key causes the contents of the current [[text mode]] [[Computer display|screen]] memory buffer to be copied to the standard printer [[Computer port (hardware)|port]], usually [[LPT]]1. In essence, whatever is currently on the screen when the key was pressed (as long as it is text) was printed. There is also a [[Unicode]] character “Print Screen Symbol”, U+2399: :<span style="font-size: 48pt; line-height: 1.3">{{Unicode|&#x2399;}}</span> == Modern use == Newer-generation operating systems using a [[GUI|graphical interface]] tend to copy a [[bitmap]] image of the current screen to their [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]] or comparable storage area, which can be inserted into documents as a [[screenshot]]. Some [[shell (computing)|shells]] allow modification of the exact behavior using modifier keys such as the [[control key]]. In [[Microsoft Windows]], pressing print screen will capture the entire screen, while pressing the [[alt key]] in combination with print screen will capture the currently selected window. With alt printscreen on Windows XP Pro only the monitor area is copied rather than the true window. The captured image can then be [[Cut and paste|pasted]] into an editing program such as a [[word processor]], [[email]], or [[graphics software]]. On keyboards that have an [[F Lock]] key, you may have to press F Lock first. Pressing print screen, with both the left alt key and left [[shift key]] pressed, turns on a high contrast mode for people with [[visual impairment]]s. In [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] [[desktop environment]]s, print screen behavior is similar to that of Microsoft Windows by default. However, a window will additionally pop up, prompting to save the screenshot to a file (in the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] format by default). ==Print screen, screen capture on Macintosh== [[Macintosh]] does not use a print screen key. Instead key combinations are used that start with [[Command key|command]] - [[Shift key| shift]]. The key combinations are used to provide more advanced functionality including the ability to select screen objects. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Key Sequence ! What it Does ! Saves to !
