federal law (10 U.S.C. section 1044). Some military members have authority to certify documents or administer oaths, without being given all notarial powers. In addition to the powers granted by the federal government, some states have enacted laws granting notarial powers to commissioned officers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA403141&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=Notarial Services |accessdate=4 June 2009 |date=10 April 1997 |publisher=U.S. Army }}</ref> ==Civil Law jurisdictions== {{Main|Civil law notary}} The role undertaken by notaries in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries is much greater than in [[common law]] countries. Notaries in the former countries frequently undertake work done in common law countries by the Titles Office and other Government agencies. The qualifications imposed by some countries is much greater. In [[Greece]], for example, a practitioner must choose to be either a solicitor or a notary. This should be contrasted with the [[Latin America]]n ''notario'' who may be similar to an [[Lawyer|attorney at law]] or [[lawyer]]. In Mexico, notaries are specialized lawyers acting as public officers with jurisdiction over voluntary, non-contentious private law such as real estate transactions, incorporation of corporations and legal entities, wills and successions among other acts. They are appointed after a competition between various candidates for the same position.<ref>{{Citation|'''Ley del Notariado del Distrito Federal, Articulos 42 y 54'''|date=August 2009}}</ref> A French ''[[notaire]]'', a German ''[[:de:Notar|Notar]]'' and an Italian ''[[:it:Notaio|Notaio]]'' register [[will (law)|will]]s and other documents, and authenticates transactions of [[real estate]]. In the few United States jurisdictions where trained notaries are allowed (such as [[Puerto Rico]]), the practice of these jurists is limited to non-judicial legal advice, property conveyencing and legal drafting. ==Notable Notaries== In addition to many well-known notaries public from the world of the law, there are several well-known notaries from other arenas of achievement. Klaus Hergescheimer of Massapequa, NY has the distinction of becoming the first notary to be commissioned in all fifty states (a feat since duplicated several times by others), as well as numerous territories and trust possessions. [[Richard Nixon]] confidant [[Robert Abplanalp]] was a notary for many years, as were [[Fawn Hall]], teacher and astronaut [[Christa McAuliffe]], and former major league baseball pitcher [[Joe Moeller]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} From the world of entertainment, actor [[Stanley Tucci]], actresses [[Mindy Cohn]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]], television host [[David Horowitz (consumer advocate)|David Horowitz]], and radio producer [[Gary Dell'Abate]] all hold or have held notary certificates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Upon the death of President [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923, [[Calvin Coolidge]] was sworn in as President by his father, [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.]], a [[Vermont]] notary public. However, as there was some controversy as to whether a state notary public had the authority to administer the presidential [[oath of office]], President Coolidge took the oath, again, upon returning to Washington.<ref>[http://vermont-archives.org/notary/guide/pdf/NOTARY%20GUIDE%202006.pdf ''Short Guide for Vermont Notaries Public.''] (2007).

NotePub is also an open purpose [[wiki]] without a [[markup language]]. Notes can include files and images, and can be linked to other notes within NotePub, or to external websites. Content is organized chronologically and with tags. Read and write permissions can be set for each note and user name. The user interface relies on [[drag-and-drop]] techniques to include content from other web sites or upload multiple images and files from the client computer. The user interface has been criticized as cluttered and awkward at first, but hassle-free after some initial learning.<ref>[http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/03/04/notepub-messy-but-good/ "WebWorkerDaily article of NotePub"]</ref><ref>[http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/notepub-easily-create-share-rich-notes/ "MakeUseOf review on NotePub"]</ref> In most other examples of note taking software, such as [[Evernote]], [[Springnote]], and [[Google Notebook]], search results are limited to a single notebook (in effect, a collection of notes created by a single user). NotePub search results include all public and private notes to which the current user has access. The importance of NotePub to the evolution of [[notetaking]] software, [[wikis]], and [[collaborative real-time editor]]s is the innovation of all users sharing a single stream of online notes, with access permissions set on a note by note basis.<ref>[http://notepub.com/?note=2858 "NotePub Public Launch"]</ref> Notepub does lack some of the features commonly found in notetaking software, such as [[RSS]] syndication. Its emphasis is more on quick accessibility than on features. <ref>[http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/notepub-com-the-most-direct-way-to-save-share-notes "KillerStartUps review of NotePub"]</ref> NotePub first launched on May 1, 2008. == References == <references/> ==External links== * [http://notepub.com NotePub web site] {{Microblogging}} [[Category:Notetaking software]] [[Category:Wikis]] [[Category:Personal information managers]] [[Category:Personal wikis]] [[Category:Web applications]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26719</id> <title>Nova Hreod</title> <text>{{Coord|51.591|-1.803|display=title}} {{Infobox UK school | name = Nova Hreod College | image = | size = | latitude = | longitude = | dms = dms | motto = | motto_pl = | established = | approx = | closed = | c_approx = | type = [[Coeducation|Co-educational]] [[secondary school]] | religion = 1947 Education Act | president = | head_label = Headteacher | head = Julie Tridgell | r_head_label = | r_head =
