Dent identified eight concepts: :* holism rather than analysis or reductionism, :* relationships rather than entities, :* interaction with environment as opposed to closed or isolated systems, :* indeterminism as opposed to predictability, :* circular causal loops rather than linear causality, :* self organization, observation as part of or directly related to systems, and :* reflexivity or interaction between a system and what is known about it. * [http://www.garywitherspoon.com/Chapter5.htm Holistic Symmetry in Modern Science], webtext by Gary Witherspoon, 03 April 2007. : Witherspoon states, that "the rise of abstract art and the development of various systems theories have an important parallel. Abstract art goes beyond the recognition of entity or image and focuses attention on interaction and interrelatedness, striving to uncover and reveal holistic essences. Systems theories have tried to get us beyond linear cause and effect notions and tried to get us to think of phenomena in terms of interaction and interrelationship. It is interesting and significant that abstract art and quantum theory arose at about the same time. Both of these developments preceded the application of various forms of systems theory to the social and biological sciences. Scientific insight and conceptualization have paralleled artistic imagination and aesthetic formulation." * [http://www.knowledgenet.org/papers/indopaper.doc. The relevance of "Western" studies of cyberspace], paper by David Hakken, State University of New York Institute of technology, 2002. :Hakken speaks about various additive forms of systems theory in Western anthropology in the 1980s and 1990s: "dual", "tri", "quadra", etc. (e.g., "race and class", "gender, race, and class," "sexual orientation, gender, race, and class"). * [http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm Behaviorism: Origins of the Concept] paper by Erkki Berndtson, University of Helsinki Finland: :As forms of systems theory Berndtson mentions: general systems theory, cybernetics, systems analysis and functionalism. * [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CSPAPER.html Basic Papers on Cybernetics and Systems Science], Francis Heylighten, Pricipia Cybernetica Net, 1992. {{Systems}} [[Category:Systems theory| ]] [[Category:WikiProject Systems lists|Systems]] [[nl:Gebruiker:Mdd/Begrippenkaders/Vormen van systeemtheorie]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22338</id> <title>List of variational topics</title> <text>This is a '''list of variational topics''' in from [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].
