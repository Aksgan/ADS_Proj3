LGA is short for [[Land Grid Array]]. LGA 1356 is designed as a replacement for the [[LGA 1366]] (known as ''Socket B''). LGA 1356 has 1356 protruding pins to make contact with the pads on the processor. Processors of LGA 1356 and LGA 1366 sockets are not compatible with each other since they have different socket notches. The main difference between [[LGA 2011]] and LGA 1356 is 2 [[QPI]] connections on the LGA 2011 and 1 QPI connection on the LGA 1356. Other noticeable difference include 2 more Gen 3 [[PCI-e]] connections on the LGA 2011 and supports one more channel of DDR3, each of its DDR3 channel can support one more [[DIMM]] (only applicable to DDR3 and not DDR3-L) <ref>http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/video/pcw/docs/360/112/6.pdf</ref> ==See also== * [[List of Intel microprocessors]] {{Intelsock}} [[Category:CPU sockets]] ==References== {{Reflist|1}} [[ru:Socket B2]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20948</id> <title>LGP-30</title> <text>[[Image:LGP30.agr.jpg|thumb|250px|LGP-30 at Boston's Computer Museum with cover removed. Control panel is at top center, to the left of the memory drum.]] The '''LGP-30''', standing for '''Librascope General Purpose''' and then '''Librascope General Precision''', was an early off-the-shelf computer. It was manufactured by the [[Librascope]] company of [[Glendale, California]] (a division of [[General Precision Inc.]]), and sold and serviced by the Royal Precision Electronic Computer Company, a joint venture with the [[Royal McBee]] division of the [[Royal Typewriter Company]]. The LGP-30 was first manufactured in 1956 with a retail price of $47,000. The LGP-30 was commonly referred to as a desk computer. It was 26 [[inch]]es deep, 33 inches high, and 44 inches long, exclusive of the typewriter shelf. The computer weighed approximately 740 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] and was mounted on sturdy [[caster]]s which facilitated movement of the computer. == Design == [[File:LGP-30 control panel.jpg|thumb|The LGP-30 control panel.]] The primary design consultant for the Librascope computer was [[Stan Frankel]], a [[Manhattan Project]] veteran and one of the first programmers of [[ENIAC]]. He designed a usable computer with a minimal amount of hardware. The single address [[instruction set]] had only 16 commands. Not only was the [[main memory]] on [[drum memory|magnetic drum]], but so were the [[central processing unit|CPU]] [[processor register|register]]s, timing information and the master bit clock, each on a dedicated track. The number of [[vacuum tube]]s were kept to a minimum by using solid-state [[diode]] logic, a [[bit]]-[[serial computer|serial architecture]] and multiple usage of each of the 15 flip-flops. It was a [[Binary numeral system|binary]], 31 bit word [[computer]] with a 4096 [[Word (computer science)|word]] [[drum memory]]. Standard inputs were the [[Flexowriter]] keyboard and [[paper tape]] (ten 6-bit characters/second). The only printing output was the Flexowriter [[computer printer|printer]] ([[typewriter]], working at 10 characters/second). An optional higher speed paper tape reader and punch was available as a separate peripheral. [[Image:LGP-30.jpg|thumb|left|Console typewriter of an LGP-30 at the [[Computer History Museum]]. Note that, as was common in [[typewriter]]s of the time, there is no key for the number 1 (lower case l was used instead).]]The computer contained 113 electronic [[vacuum tube|tubes]] and 1450 [[diode]]s. The 113 electronic tubes were mounted on 34 etched circuit pluggable cards which also contain associated components. Although 34 pluggable cards were used, there were only 12 different types of such cards. Card-extenders were available to permit dynamic testing of all machine functions. Six hundred and eighty of the 1450 diodes were mounted on one pluggable [[logic board]]. The LGP-30 required 1500 [[watt]]s when operating under full load. The power inlet cord was plugged into any standard 115 [[volt]] 60 cycle single phase line. The computer contained internal [[voltage regulation]] against power line variations of voltages from 95 to 130 volts. In addition to regulation of power line variations, the computer also contained the circuitry required to permit a warm-up stage. This warm-up stage minimized thermal shock to tubes to ensure long component life. The computer contained its own blower unit and directed filtered [[air]], through ducts, to tubes and diodes, in order to ensure component life and proper operation. No expensive [[air conditioning]] needed to be installed if operated within a reasonable temperature range. There were 32 bit locations per drum word, but only 31 were used, permitting a "restoration of magnetic flux in the head" at the 32nd bit time. Since there was only one address per instruction, a method was needed to optimise allocation of [[operand]]s. Otherwise, each instruction would wait a complete drum (or disk) revolution each time a data reference was made. The LGP-30 provided for [[operand]]-location optimization by [[interleaving]] the [[logical address]]es on the drum so that two adjacent addresses (e.g., 00 and 01) were separated by nine physical locations. These spaces allowed for operands to be located next to the instructions which use them. There were 64 tracks, each with 64 words (sectors). The time between two adjacent physical words was approximately 0.260 millisecond, and the time between two adjacent addresses was 9 x 0.260 or 2.340 [[milliseconds]]. The worst-case access time was 16.66 ms. Half of the instruction (15 bits) was unused. The unused half could be used for extra instructions, indexing, [[indirect addressing]], or a second (+1) address to locate the next instruction, each of which could increase program performance. [[File:Counter instruction accumulator.jpg|thumb|The LGP-30 register display, which used an oscilloscope behind this mask.]] A truly unique feature of the LGP-30 was the way it handled multiply. Despite the LGP-30 being inexpensive, it had built in multiply. Since this was a drum computer and bits needed to be acted on serially
