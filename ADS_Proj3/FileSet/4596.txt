These initial preparations included researching existing digital library initiatives and standards. Digitization program management was appointed, a formal collection development plan was drafted, and potential users, partnerships, and program goals were identified. Through the UA Archives, the Library would lend their expertise to other community organizations and individuals by digitizing, cataloging, and providing access to historically and culturally significant materials related to [[Upper Arlington, Ohio|Upper Arlington]]. The Upper Arlington Historical Society was a natural choice as the first community organization with which the Library would partner. The Society and its members play an active role in the community, which is also a reflection of residents' interest in the history of their city. In addition to their local history archives, the Historical Society maintains preservation guidelines; a historical home inventory; and the Upper Arlington Wall of Honor, a tribute to notable area residents. Due to the volunteer nature of the organization, however, the rich resources of the Historical Society were not always easily accessible to the community. The Library approached the Upper Arlington Historical Society in the spring of 2003 with an offer to digitize and provide online access to their holdings. In November of that year the Library penned a formal agreement with the Historical Society.<ref>Bournea, C. (2004, August 26). Library, Historical Society to launch web site.

One photograph shows the Marble Cliff Depot, a railroad station known originally as the Scioto Depot. This station house served the Upper Arlington area until the late 1920s and was located on the south side of Fifth Avenue just east of the Pennsylvania tracks, near the present day entrance to First Community Village. Another photograph shows the first teacher and students in Upper Arlington at a time when classes were held in the basement of the home of King Thompson, one of Upper Arlington's founders. Yet another captures a scene from Camp Willis, a military training camp located in Upper Arlington during the community's early development in 1916. Ohio Guardsmen were trained at this camp to defend the United States against cross-border attacks from [[Pancho Villa|Pancho Villa's]] Mexican troops.<ref>Rubenking, B. (2004, September 8).

''Upper Arlington News'', p. 5B.</ref> The debut of the UA Archives website also included approximately 2,000 pages of text and photographs from the ''Norwester'' magazine, the original community newspaper, published from November 1917 through March 1922. Among other topics, the ''Norwester'' magazine covered local residents, homes, schools, sports, and daily life. The magazine also included first-hand accounts of [[World War I]], received from local residents stationed in Europe, and chronicled life on the home front as community members bought [[liberty bond|Liberty Bonds]] and [[war savings stamps]], planted backyard [[victory garden|war gardens]], and debated the patriotic virtues of continuing to spend their money versus saving. ==Collection Development== Upper Arlington Public Library staff select materials for the UA Archives, subject to the policies and mandates of the Library's Board of Trustees. The UA Archives program actively solicits materials relating to the history of Upper Arlington, Ohio, from local government, community organizations, businesses, and individuals. Historical materials in all formats are considered and may consist of photographs, documents, arts and crafts, and audio or video recordings. Selection criteria include historical significance and relevance of the subject or its depiction of daily life, the educational or entertainment value of the subject, and the availability of sufficient and reliable descriptions of the material. All items must either be in the public domain or have written copyright permissions granted before inclusion in the UA Archives.<ref>Klein, S. Y. (2004). ''UA Archives: Digitization and development of the Upper Arlington Public Library's local history website''. Master's research project, Kent State University, School of Library and Information Science.</ref> The UA Archives encourages the digitization of items even if a potential donor wishes to retain the original source materials. In this case, the original items remain in the ownership of the donor, and the Upper Arlington Public Library assumes ownership of the digital representations. When materials are acquired through permanent donation, the Library encourages the transfer of original items to the Upper Arlington Historical Society for permanent storage after the digitization process has been completed. In addition to the ''Norwester'' magazines and historical photographs included when the UA Archives site launched, new materials are continually incorporated. The City of Upper Arlington has provided maps depicting the community's annexation history and historic district, and the Library has added historic 1880s plat maps from its own collection. The Library has also partnered with the Upper Arlington City School District, which granted permission for digitization of the [[Upper Arlington High School (Ohio)|Upper Arlington High School]] yearbooks from 1923–present. All volumes through 1999 were added to the UA Archives site on October 7, 2009, with one subsequent volume to be added each year.<ref>Campbell, D. (2008, October 8).
