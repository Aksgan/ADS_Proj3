pedestal model of 1969 was a short-lived product made by [[Honeywell]] and offered by [[Neiman Marcus]]. It sold for $10,000, weighed over 100 pounds, and was used for storing recipes (but reading or entering these recipes would have been very difficult for the average cook, since the [[user interface]] required the person to take a two-week course to learn to program the device, using only toggle-switch input and binary light output). It had a built in cutting board and had a few recipes built in. No evidence has been found that any Honeywell Kitchen Computers were ever sold. <ref>[http://www.drdobbs.com/184404040 Three Chapters in the History of Home Automation]</ref> The full text of the Neiman-Marcus Advertisement seems to read: '''"If she can only cook as well as Honeywell can compute."''' "Her souffles are supreme, her meal planning a challenge? She's what the Honeywell people had in mind when they devised our Kitchen Computer. She'll learn to program it with a cross-reference to her favorite recipes by N-M's own [[Helen Corbitt]]. Then by simply pushing a few buttons obtain a complete menu organized around the entree.

Staged at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, Aurora acts as a stereotypical, isolated, and unintelligent 1969 housewife believes that Honeywell 316 has practical value. Aurora comments on the impracticality and absurdity of the object -- the idea that this product was geared toward women is meant to be ridiculous, which is one of her central arguments. <ref>http://valerieaurora.org/kitchen.html</ref> == Notes == {{reflist}} == See also == *[[SIMH]] == External links == *[http://www.series16.adrianwise.co.uk/ Honeywell Series 16] *[http://www.theoengel.nl/ddpx16/simx16.html Honeywell Minicomputer Simulation] *[http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=927&st=1 Honeywell H316 Kitchen Computer on www.old-computers.com] *[http://valerieaurora.org/kitchen.html Valerie Aurora meets the Honeywell H316 Kitchen Computer] [[Category:Honeywell]] [[Category:Minicomputers]] [[de:Honeywell H316]] {{mini-compu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>16935</id> <title>Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics</title> <text>'''Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics''' ('''HKOI'''; 香港電腦奧林匹克競賽) is an annual programming competition for secondary school students in [[Hong Kong]], emphasizing on problem solving techniques and programming skills. It is co-organized by the [[Hong Kong Association for Computer Education]] (HKACE), [[Education Bureau|Hong Kong Education Bureau]] (EDB), [[Hong Kong Computer Society]] (HKCS) and the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU). It serves as a preliminary contest to international, national and regional competitions such as the China [[National Olympiad in Informatics, China|National Olympiad in Informatics]] (NOI) and the [[International Olympiad in Informatics]] (IOI). The first HKOI was held in 1997. ==History== Hong Kong first participated in IOI in 1992. In order select representatives for the Hong Kong Delegation Team, a selection test was held a few months before the competition. In the next few years, Hong Kong started sending teams to other competitions, including the [[SEARCC]] [[International Schools' Software Competition]] (ISSC) in 1993, the [[Software Competition for the Youths]] (SCY) in 1994 and the China [[National Olympiad in Informatics, China|National Olympiad in Informatics]] in 1995. Selection tests were separately administered for these competitions, and the purpose of each test was solely to select team members for the competitions. A considerable amount of resources were used to organize these tests. The tests were not very popular among students in Hong Kong. In 1996, the [[Hong Kong Association for Computer Education]], the [[Hong Kong Computer Society]] and the Education Department of Hong Kong (now the [[Education Bureau]]) jointly organized the Joint Selection Contest to replace all the selection tests. 39 students were selected as seeds for the Hong Kong teams. They received intensive training on topics like [[data structures]] and [[algorithms]]. After that, a Team Formation Test was conducted to select the Hong Kong representatives in IOI and NOI among the seeds. Another Team Formation Test was conducted for the SEARCC-ISSC and SCY. The Joint Selection Contest was considered successful, as a group of talented students received trainings before the final team formation took place, improving the overall quality of the selected team. In addition, students who were not selected to represent Hong Kong were nevertheless given the chance to learn and prepare for other competitions in the future. In 1997, the Joint Selection Contest was renamed as the Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics. Prizes are awarded to students with good results in HKOI, who are then invited to join the HKOI Training Team. Due to the limit on the number of participants from each school, some schools organize their own team formation test to select students to take part in HKOI. ==Structure of the Competition== ===Groupings=== The participants of HKOI are divided into two groups. The '''Junior Group''' consists of students aged 17 or below, and the '''Senior Group''' consists of students aged 19 or below. The rationale of having two groups with one having an age limit of 17 is that SEARCC-ISSC requires all participants to be aged 17 or below. Another advantage of having a Junior Group is to allow more young students to enter the HKOI training team without having to compete with the more experienced senior students. ===Competition Format=== The competition format of the HKOI has changed a few times since the introduction of Joint Selection Contest in 1996. The Joint Selection Contest was conducted in written format. All programs were written down on the answer sheet. It was difficult for both participants and markers. The participants could not rely on a computer to
