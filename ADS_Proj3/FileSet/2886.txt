[[website]] links to Bob's website, the websites are reciprocally linked. Website owners often submit their sites to reciprocal [[link exchange]] directories, in order to achieve higher rankings in the [[search engines]]. Reciprocal linking between websites is an important part of the search engine optimization process because Google uses link popularity algorithms (defined as the number of links that led to a particular page and the anchor text of the link) to rank websites for relevancy. ==Resource Linking== '''Resource Links''' are a category of links, which can be either one-way or two-way, usually referenced as "Resources" or "Information" in navbars, but sometimes, especially in the early, less compartmentalized years of the Web, simply called "links". Basically, they are hyperlinks to a website or a specific webpage containing content believed to be beneficial, useful and relevant to visitors of the site establishing the link. In recent years, resource links have grown in importance because most major search engines have made it plain that—in Google's words-- "quantity, quality, and relevance of links count towards your rating."<ref>[http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=66356 "Link schemes"] Google webmaster central</ref> The engines' insistence on resource links being relevant and beneficial developed because many artificial link building methods were employed solely to "spam" search-engines, i.e. to "fool" the engines' algorithms into awarding the sites employing these unethical devices undeservedly high page ranks and/or return positions. Despite cautioning site developers (again quoting from Google) to avoid "'free-for-all' links, link popularity schemes, or submitting your site to thousands of search engines (because) these are typically useless exercises that don't affect your ranking in the results of the major search engines<ref>[http://wiep.net/link-value-factors/ "Study on differences in link value"]</ref> -- at least, not in a way you would likely consider to be positive,"<ref>[http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35291 "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)"] Google webmaster central</ref> most major engines have deployed technology designed to "red flag" and potentially penalize sites employing such practices. ==Forum signature linking== [[Internet Forum|Forum]] signature linking is a technique used to build backlinks to a website. This is the process of using forum communities that allow outbound hyperlinks in a member's signature. This can be a fast method to build up inbound links to a website; it can also produce some targeted traffic if the website is relevant to the forum topic. It should be stated that forums using the [[nofollow]] attribute will have no actual [[Search Engine Optimization]] value. ==Blog comments== Leaving a comment on a blog can result in a relevant do-follow link to the individual's website. Most of the time, however, leaving a comment on a blog turns into a no-follow link, which is almost useless in the eyes of search engines, such as Google and [[Yahoo! Search]]. On the other hand, most blog comments get clicked on by the readers of the blog if the comment is well-thought-out and pertains to the discussion of the other commenters and the post on the blog. ==See also== *[[Backlink]]: incoming links *[[Deep linking]]: linking directly to a page within another website. *[[Inline linking]]: linking directly to content within another website. ==References== {{More footnotes|date=February 2009}} {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.searchenginejournal.com/all-wikipedia-links-are-now-nofollow/4288/ All Wikipedia Links Are Now NOFOLLOW] ''Search Engine Journal'', January 21, 2007. {{Hypermedia}} [[Category:Search engine optimization]] [[Category:Articles with Alice and Bob explanations]] [[Category:World Wide Web]] [[Category:Hypertext]] [[ar:طرق ربط الانترنت]] [[es:Link bait]] [[ja:リンクベイト]] [[no:Overlenking]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24247</id> <title>MetraLabs GmbH</title> <text>{{orphan|date=July 2010}} {{advert|date=July 2010}} {{Infobox company |logo = [[File:01 MetraLabs Logo colour background 1000px.png|150px]] |company_name = MetraLabs |industry = [[Service Robotics]] |foundation = 2001 |company_slogan = ''robots that enspire.'' |location = Am Vogelherd 22, 98693 Ilmenau‎, Germany |area_served = Europe |company_type = [[GmbH]] |products = SCITOS G5, SCITOS A5, CogniDrive |homepage = http://www.metralabs.com }} '''MetraLabs GmbH''', develops and produces [[Mobile Robotic Platforms]] for the industrial and the commercial market.

The MetraLabs [[SCITOS G5]], is an autonomous mobile platform which is compatible with a multitude of additional instruments and devices to carry out specified tasks, ranging from logistical tasks, moving objects from one place to another, as well as measurements within laboratories.

Given ''n'' cities with specified distances, one wants to build ''k'' warehouses in different cities and minimize the distance of the farthest city from its closest warehouse. In graph theory this means finding a set of ''k'' vertices for which the largest distance of any point to its closest vertex in the ''k''-set is minimum. The vertices must be in a metric space, or in other words a [[complete graph]] that satisfies the [[triangle inequality]]. ==Formal definition== Given a complete undirected graph ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'') with distances ''d''(''v''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''v''<sub>''j''</sub>) &isin;
