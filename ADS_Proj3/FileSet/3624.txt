Punchscan is designed to offer integrity, privacy, and transparency. The system is voter-verifiable, provides an [[End-to-end auditable voting systems|end-to-end (E2E) audit]] mechanism, and issues a [[End-to-end auditable voting systems|ballot receipt]] to each voter. The system won grand prize at the 2007 [[University Voting Systems Competition]]. The [[computer software]] which Punchscan incorporates is [[open source]]; the [[source code]] was released on 2 November 2006 under a revised [[BSD licence]].<ref>[http://www.itbusinessedge.com/item/?ci=21633 Punchscan School Election System Goes Open Source]. IT Business Edge</ref> However, Punchscan is software independent; it draws its security from [[cryptographic]] functions instead of relying on [[software security]] like [[DRE voting machine]]s. For this reason, Punchscan can be run on [[closed source]] [[operating system]]s, like [[Microsoft Windows]], and still maintain unconditional integrity. The Punchscan team, with additional contributors, has since developed [[Scantegrity]]. == Voting procedure == [[Image:Marked ballot.jpg|thumb|right|A marked Punchscan ballot. Full ballot (top), separated ballot (bottom).]] A Punchscan [[ballot]] has two layers of paper. On the top layer, the [[candidates]] are listed with a [[symbol]] or [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] beside their name. Below the candidate list, there are a series of round holes in the top layer of the ballot. Inside the holes on the bottom layer, the corresponding symbols are printed. To cast a vote for a candidate, the voter must locate the hole with the symbol corresponding to the symbol beside the candidate's name. This hole is marked with a [[Bingo (US)|Bingo]]-style ink dauber, which is purposely larger than the hole. The voter then separates the ballot, chooses either the top or the bottom layer to keep as a [[End-to-end auditable voting systems|receipt]], and [[Paper shredder|shreds]] the other layer. The receipt is [[Optical reader|scanned]] at the polling station for [[Vote counting system|tabulation]]. The order of the symbols beside the candidate names is generated [[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-randomly]] for each ballot, and thus differs from ballot to ballot. Likewise for the order of the symbols in the holes. For this reason, the receipt does not contain enough information to determine which candidate the vote was cast for. If the top layer is kept, the order of the symbols through the holes is unknown. If the bottom layer is kept, the order of the symbols beside the candidates name is unknown. Therefore the voter cannot prove to someone else how they voted, which prevents [[Electoral fraud|vote buying]] or voter intimidation. == Tabulation procedure == As an example, consider a two candidate election between [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] and [[Pepsi]], as illustrated in the preceding diagram. The order of the letters beside the candidates' names could be A and then B, or B and then A. We will call this ordering <math>P_1</math>, and let <math>P_1</math>=0 for the former ordering and <math>P_1</math>=1 for the latter. Therefore, <math>P_1</math>: order of symbols beside candidate list, :<math>P_1\in\{0,1\}=\{\mbox{AB},\mbox{BA}\}\,</math>. Likewise we can generalize for other parts of a ballot: <math>P_2</math>: order of symbols through the holes, :<math>P_2\in\{0,1\}=\{\mbox{AB},\mbox{BA}\}\,</math>. <math>P_3</math>: which hole is marked, :<math>P_3\in\{0,1\}=\{\mbox{1st},\mbox{2nd}\}\,</math>. <math>R</math>: result of the ballot, :<math>R\in\{0,1\}=\{\mbox{Coke},\mbox{Pepsi}\}\,</math>. Note that the order of the candidates' names are fixed across all ballots. The result of a ballot can be calculated directly as, :<math>R = P_1 + P_2 + P_3\bmod 2\,</math> ('''Equation 1''') However when one layer of the ballot is shredded, either <math>P_1</math> or <math>P_2</math> is destroyed. Therefore there is insufficient information to calculate <math>R</math> from the receipt (which is scanned). In order to calculate the election results, an electronic [[database]] is used. Before the election, the database is created with a series of columns as such. Each row in the database represents a ballot, and the order that the ballots are stored in the database is [[Random permutation|shuffled]] (using a [[cryptographic key]] that each candidate can [[Key-agreement protocol|contribute to]]). The first column, <math>D_1</math>, has the shuffled order of the serial numbers. <math>D_2</math> contains a pseudorandom [[bitstream]] generated from the key, and it will act as a [[stream cipher]]. <math>D_3</math> will store an intermediate result. <math>D_4</math> contains a bit such that: :<math>D_2 + D_4 = P_1 + P_2 \bmod 2\,</math> The result of each ballot will be stored in a separate column, <math>R</math>, where the order of the ballots will be reshuffled again. Thus <math>D_5</math> contains the row number in the <math>R</math> column where the result will be placed. After the election is run and the <math>P_3</math> values have been scanned in, <math>D_3</math> is calculated as: :<math>D_3 = P_3 + D_2 \bmod 2\,</math> And the result is calculated as, :<math>R = D_3 + D_4 \bmod 2\,</math> This is equivalent to equation 1, :<math>\begin{align} R &= (D_3) + D_4 \bmod 2\\ &= (P_3 + D_2) + D_4 \bmod 2\\ &= P_3 + (D_2 + D_4) \bmod 2\\ &= P_3 + (P_1 + P_2) \bmod 2 \end{align}</math> The result column is published and given the ballots have been shuffled (twice), the order of the results column does not indicate which result is from which ballot number. Thus the election authority cannot trace votes to serial numbers. ===Generalized form=== For an election with <math>n</math> candidates, the above procedure is followed using [[Modulo operation|modulo]]-n equations. == Basic auditing procedures == The voter's ballot receipt does not indicate which candidate the voter cast their ballot for, and therefore it is not secret information. After an election, the election authority will post an image of each receipt online. The voter can look up her ballot by typing in the serial number and she can check that information held by the election authority matches her ballot. This way, the voter can be confident that her ballot was ''cast as intended''. Any voter or interested party can also inspect part of the database to ensure the results were calculated correctly. They cannot inspect the whole database, otherwise they could link votes to ballot serial numbers. However, half of the database can be safely inspected without breaking privacy.
