is easy to how to use it. However, manufacturing a well-functioning standard calculator takes a lot of processes, far more than the task of calculation performed by the users. Fifth, there are very [[research|research-intensive]] industries that do not serve as infrastructure to information-production or sophisticated decision-making. Pharmaceutical, food-processing, some apparel design, and some other "high-tech" industries belong to this type. These products are not exclusively for information production or sophisticated decision-making, although many are helpful. Some services, such as medical examination are in this category as well. One can say these industries involve a great deal of sophisticated decision-making, although that part is combined with manufacturing or "non-informational" activities. Finally, there are industries that are not research intensive, but serve as [[infrastructure]] for information production and sophisticated decision-making. Manufacturing of office furniture would be a good example, although it sometimes involves research in ergonomics and development of new materials. As stated above, this rather long list of candidates for information industries is not a definitive way of organizing differences that researchers may pay attention to when they define the term. Among the difficulties is, for example, the position of advertising industry. ==Alternative concepts== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==Importance of information industries== Information industries are considered important for several distinctive reasons. Even among the experts who think information industries are important, disagreements may exist regarding which reason to accept and which to reject. First, information industries is a rapidly growing part of economy. The demand for information goods and services from consumers is increasing. In case of consumers, media including music and motion picture, personal computers, video game-related industries, are among the information industries. In case of businesses, information industries include computer programming, system design, so-called FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) industries, telecommunications, and others. When demand for these industries are growing nationally or internationally, that creates an opportunity for an urban, regional, or national economy to grow rapidly by specializing on these sectors. Second, information industries are considered to boost innovation and productivity of other industries. An economy with a strong information industry might be a more competitive one than others, other factors being equal. Third, some believe that the effect of the changing economic structure (or composition of industries within an economy) is related to the broader social change. As information becomes the central part of our economic activities we evolve into an "[[information society]]", with an increased role of mass media, digital technologies, and other mediated information in our daily life, leisure activities, social life, work, politics, education, art, and many other aspects of society. ==External links== {{Wikibooks|Legal and Regulatory Issues in the Information Economy}} * [http://www.siia.net/ Software and Information Industry Association website] * [http://spaces.msn.com/gavinwilson/blog/ Daily IT news blog] <!-- Silicon Valley information industries as a source of competition productivity paradox, high-tech greater market for media industries for consumers and businesses --> [[Category:Information Age]] [[Category:Industries]] [[Category:Information technology]] [[es:Industria de la información]] [[hr:Informacijska industrija]] [[uk:Інформаційна індустрія]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18329</id> <title>Information ladder</title> <text>{{No footnotes|date=August 2010}} The '''information ladder''' is a diagram created by [[education]] professor [[Norman Longworth]] to describe the stages in human [[learning]]. According to the ladder, a learner moves through the following progression to construct "wisdom" at the highest level from "data" at the lowest level: : '''[[Data]] → [[Information]] → [[Knowledge]] → [[Understanding]] → [[Insight]] → [[Wisdom]]''' Whereas the first two steps can be scientifically exactly defined, the upper parts belong to the domain of psychology and philosophy. The related model in [[information science]] is referred to as [[DIKW|DIKW Hierarchy]]. ==References== * Longworth, Norman and Davies, W. Keith. ''Lifelong Learning''.

For example, when designing an encrypted instant messaging network, a network engineer without the capacity to crack your [[encryption]] codes could see when you are transmitting messages, even if he could not read them. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Japan]]ese for a while were using secret codes such as [[PURPLE]]; even before such codes were cracked, some basic information could be extracted about the content of the messages by looking at which relay stations sent a message onwards. Designers of secure systems often forget to take information leakage into account. One classic example of this is when the [[France|French]] government designed a mechanism to aid encrypted communications over an analog line, such as at a phone booth. It was a device that clamped onto both ends of the phone, performed the encrypting operations, and sent the signals over the phone line. Unfortunately for the French, the rubber seal that attached the device to the phone was not airtight. It was later discovered that although the encryption itself was solid, if you listened carefully, you could hear the speaker, since the phone was picking up some of the speech! Information leakage can subtly or completely destroy the security of an otherwise secure system. Generally, only very advanced systems employ defenses against information leakage - there are three main ways to do it: * Use [[steganography]] to hide the fact that you're transmitting a message at all. * Use [[chaffing]] to make it unclear to whom you are transmitting messages (but this does not hide from others the fact that you are transmitting messages). * For busy retransmitting proxies, such as a [[Mixmaster anonymous remailer|Mixmaster]] node: randomly delay and shuffle the order of outbound packets - this will assist in disguising a given message's path, especially if there are multiple, popular forwarding nodes, such as are employed with mixmaster mail forwarding.
