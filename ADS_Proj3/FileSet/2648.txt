systems theory''' gives an overview of different types of [[systems theory]], which are mentioned in scientific book titles or articles.<ref>There are a lot of book titles named ''... systems: theory and applications''. This leaves the term ''... systems: theory'', which is not acceptable as a type systems theory.</ref> The following more than 40 types of systems theory are all explicitly named ''systems theory'' and represent a unique [[conceptual framework]] in a specific field of [[science]]. [[Systems theory]] has been developed since the 1950s and nowadays in the new Millennium a long set of specialized systems theories and [[cybernetics]] exist. In the beginnings [[General Systems Theory]] was developed by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] to overcome the over-specialisation of the modern times and as a worldview of [[holism]]. The systems theories nowadays are closer to the traditional specialisation by than to holism by interdependences and mutual completing up of mutually different specialists. <ref>Matjaž Mulej (2006), "Systems, Cybernetics and Innovations", in: ''Kybernetics'', Vol 35 No. 7/8, pp. 939-940.</ref> {{compactTOC}}__NOTOC__ ==A== * Abstract systems theory<ref> [[Mihailo D.
