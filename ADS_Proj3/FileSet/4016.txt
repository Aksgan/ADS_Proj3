Based on the Intel XScale 400 MHz processor. However some had a Cache bug on the PXA-250 processor (easily fixed!). Popular ROMs for the SL-5600 include Watapon, Synergy, and OpenZaurus. *** '''SL-B500''', name of the SL-5600 in Japan ** '''SL-C700''' (Corgi), a clam-shell model and the first PDA to use Sharp's "System LCD", sold only in Japan. ** '''SL-C750''' (Shepherd), an improved version of the SL-C700 with longer battery life, a faster processor and updated software, sold only in Japan. ** '''SL-C760''' (Husky), an improved version of the SL-C700 with double the internal flash storage of the SL-C750 and a larger battery, sold only in Japan. ** '''SL-C860''' (Boxer), similar to SL-C760, it contains a software upgrade which allows it to be recognised as a USB storage device and has built in English-Japanese translation software, sold only in Japan. [[Image:Zaurus sl-c860.JPG|thumb|A Sharp Zaurus SL-C860 with an alternative OS]] ** '''SL-6000''' (Tosa), the successor to the SL-5600, available in 3 versions: *** '''SL-6000N''', 4" VGA display, Intel XScale PXA255 400 MHz processor, 64 [[Megabyte|MB]] flash memory, 64 [[Megabyte|MB]] [[Dynamic random access memory|SDRAM]], [[CompactFlash|CF]] and [[Secure Digital card|SD]] slots, and [[Infrared|IR]] port. Built in microphone, speaker, USB host port. <br>There seems to be a version called [http://www.sharp-ssp.co.jp/products/kigyoumuke/zaurus/PocketPC2003/ HC-6000N] equipped with [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Mobile#Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition|Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition]], and a handheld from [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] called [http://www.hitachi.co.jp/Prod/vims/solutions/mobile/pda/hw.html FLORA-ie MX1] with same hardware, both are only available in Japan. *** '''SL-6000L''', same as SL-6000N, also with built-in [[IEEE 802.11|802.11b]] Wi-Fi. *** '''SL-6000W''', same as SL-6000N, also with built-in [[IEEE 802.11|802.11b]] Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. ** '''SL-C3000''' (Spitz), similar to SL-C860, the SL-C3000 contains a USB host port to allow the connection of USB devices such as keyboards and mice. It also features an Intel Xscale PXA270 416 MHz CPU. While that model features only 16 [[Megabyte|MB]] flash storage it has a 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] Hitachi [[Hard disk|HDD]] and was the first PDA to feature a hard disk. It is sold only in Japan. ** '''SL-C1000''' (Akita), similar to SL-C3000, but with 128 [[Megabyte|MB]] Flash ROM instead of HDD. ** '''SL-C3100''' (Borzoi), similar to SL-C3000, Flash ROM has been increased 128 [[Megabyte|MB]], still has 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] HDD. ** '''SL-C3200''' (Terrier), latest clam-shell model, released on March 17, 2006, similar to SL-C3100. HDD has been increased to 6 [[Gigabyte|GB]], comes with updated dictionary, text to speech software from [[Nuance Communications]] and [[TOEIC]] (Test of English for International Communication) test. == Linux distributions == These are frequently called 'ROMs' in the community because the Zaurus' OS is usually stored in embedded flash memory, and are installed using a flashing tool. There's also a special "rescue" mode NOR flash (or P2ROM in newer models) in all Zauruses since the 5xxx series which allows recovery from a corrupted OS. * [[OpenZaurus]], which uses the [[OPIE user interface|OPIE]] or [[GPE Palmtop Environment|GPE]] [[graphical user interface]]s and is designed for the [[power user]]. OpenZaurus does not include the proprietary software that comes with Sharp's distribution. OpenZaurus development has been dropped in favour of Ångström which is also based on the [[OpenEmbedded]] build environment, but supports a larger range of devices, not limited to Zauri. * [[Ångström distribution]], the replacement for OpenZaurus. OpenZaurus no longer is being developed for, as its developers now work on Ångström distribution. Ångström is an OpenEmbedded build system based Zaurus distribution with its current images being console and an X11 GPE based ROM. * [http://www.pdaxrom.org pdaXrom], a distribution based on the X graphics system and the matchbox/openbox user interface. * [http://my-zaurus.narod.ru/cacko.html Cacko], an alternative to the original Sharp ROM, it is based on the same Qt graphics system with as many underlying parts of the OS upgraded as possible yet still maintains full compatibility and allows the proprietary Sharp applications to be run. * In August 2007 a port of [[Gentoo Linux]] was started which offers some promise. * Zubuntu, based on the ARM port of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] for the clam-shell models C3x00 et al., SL-6000 was started in 2008. For the Sharp and Cacko ROMs, there are third party and somewhat experimental kernels such as "Tetsu's" (a Japanese Zaurus expert) which offer interesting optimisations and drivers for unusual hardware. It is possible to replace only the Linux kernel which can give better performance while maintaining compatibility and retaining installed software that comes with a "stock" ROM. As well as the choice of GUI (qt/qtopia, X11 + matchbox, X11 + E17 etc.), one key difference is the choice of whether the kernel was built with using ARM standard EABI or not, and whether
