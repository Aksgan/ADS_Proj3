<id>16791</id> <title>History of calendars</title> <text>The '''history of calendars''' spans several thousand years. In many early civilizations, calendar systems were developed. For example, in Sumer, the birthplace of the modern [[sexagesimal]] system, there were 12 months of 29 or 30 days apiece, much like the modern Gregorian calendar. [[Mesoamerican]] cultures also developed their own intricate calendars; the ancient Maya had two separate years&mdash;the 260-day Sacred Round, and the 365-day Vague Year. Classical [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures also developed calendars; the ancient [[Athenian]]s, for one, had a [[lunisolar]] calendar that lasted 364 days, with an [[intercalary]] month added every other year. The Romans used two different year lengths; the older one had 304 days divided into 10 months; the newer 365 days divided into 12 months; very much like the modern calendar. They counted years from the founding of [[Rome]], or, sometimes, from the reign of the current consul. During the early [[Middle Ages]], various local calendars were used in Europe. The presently common [[Anno Domini]] system was developed in the 8th century, but the system only became common several centuries later, and even then, rival systems remained in use. Distinct from the rest of Europe, the [[Scandinavia]]n Vikings maintained their own calendar during this time, which was divided into two seasons; summer and winter. A definition of the calendar day resembling the modern one was first stated in the latter part of the 13th century. <!-- paragraph on modern calendars --> ==Ancient history== ===Sumer=== {{main|Sumerian calendar}} The ancient [[Sumer]]ian calendar divided a year into 12 [[lunar month]]s of 29 or 30 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/mesopotamiancalander.htm|title=Mesopotamia, Calendar|publisher=International World History Project|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> Each month began with the sighting of a new moon.

In addition to these holy days, there were also feast days which varied from city to city. A day was divided into twelve hours, six daylight hours, each lasting one-sixth of the day, and six nighttime hours, each lasting one-sixth of the night. This meant the length of hours varied from season to season, daylight hours being shorter in the winter and longer in the summer and vice versa.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} ===Maya=== {{main|Mayan calendar}} Of all the ancient calendar systems, the [Maya civilization|Maya] and other [[Mesoamerican]] systems are the most complex. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n calendar had 2 years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or ''tzolkin'', and the 365-day Vague Year, or ''haab''.<ref name="maya">{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html|title=Maya civilization|accessdate=2008-04-03|publisher=Civilization.ca}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[Image:MAYA-g-log-cal-D20-Ajaw.png|thumb|right|200px|A modern pictogram of the Mayan god [[Ahau]], after which the 20th day of the ''tzolkin'' cycle was named]] The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names, mostly the names of gods: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau. The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on.<ref name="maya"/> The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau.<ref name="maya" /> The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to our [[Gregorian calendar|modern calendar]], consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five day period at the end. The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku. The unlucky five-day period was known as ''uayeb'', and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck.<ref name="maya" /> The Vauge Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on. These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a "bundle" and was similar to a modern day century.<ref name="maya" /> ===Greece=== The [[Attic calendar|ancient Athenian calendar]] was a [[lunisolar]] calendar with 354 day years, consisting of twelve months of alternating length of 29 or 30 days. To keep the calendar in line with the solar year of 365.25 days, an extra, intercalary month was added in every other year.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The Athenian months were called Hekatombion, Metageitnion, Boedromion, Pyanepsion, Maimakterion, Poseidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, Elaphebolion, Munychion, Thargelion, and Skirophorion.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ginzel: Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie |year=1911 |volume=2 |publisher=F.K. |location=Germany
