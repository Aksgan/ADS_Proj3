ridged roof== A simple ridged roof consists of declined [[rafter]]s that rest on vertical wall-plates on top of each wall. The top ends of the rafters meet at the horizontal ridge plate or ridge beam. Horizontal [[purlin]]s are fixed to the rafters to support the roof covering. Heavier under purlin are used to support longer rafter spans. [[Tie beam]]s or ceiling joists, are connected between the lower ends of opposite rafters to prevent them from spreading and forcing the walls apart. [[Collar beam]]s or collar ties may be fixed higher up between opposite rafters for extra strength. The rafters, tie beams and joists serve to transmit the weight of the roof to the walls of the building. There are a number of structural systems employed to facilitate this, including the use of wall-plates set at the top of the wall, [[hammer-beam]]s, which spread the weight down the wall and create an equilibrium between outward and upward thrust, [[king post]]s which transfer the weight of the roof ridge, and various types of [[truss]]es. In [[cyclone]] and [[hurricane]] prone areas the main [[engineering]] consideration is to hold the roof down during severe storms. Every component of the roof (as of course the rest of the structure) has to withstand the uplift forces of high wind speeds. This is not normally a problem in areas not prone to high wind. Modern roofing technologies, apparent in the accompanying photo of a house under construction in a region of [[Northern Australia]], include the purpose-made steel hook bracket which is bolted to the truss with M16 bolt. The bracket is bolted to an M16 bolt cast in situ, embedded 300 mm into the [[reinforced concrete]] block wall. This system is typically in place every 900 mm around [[perimeter]] == Commercially available roofing materials== [[Image:Hip-roof.jpg|thumb|250px|A hip roof construction in Australia showing multinail truss construction.

Many different kinds of materials have been used as weather proofing material: * [[Thatch]] is roofing made of plant stalks in overlapping layers.<ref>[http://thatch.org/ Thatching Information]</ref> ** [[Wheat]] [[Straw]], widely used in England, France and other parts of Europe. **[[Seagrass]], used in coastal areas where there are [[estuary|estuaries]] such as Scotland. Has a longer life than straw. Claimed to have a life in exccess of 60 years.<ref>[http://www.thatching.com/ as claimed by McGhee & Co. Roof Thatchers]</ref> ** [[Rye]] [[Straw]], commonly used in Eastern Europe. * [[Roof shingle|Shingles]], called ''shakes'' in North America. ''Shingles'' is the generic term for a roofing material that is in many overlapping sections, regardless of the nature of the material. The word is also used specifically to denote shingles made of wood. ** [[Thuja plicata|Red cedar]]. Life expectancy, up to 30 years.<ref>[http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:ks1Ak33enMsJ:www.pathnet.org/si.asp%3Fid%3D517+Wood+shingles&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=au Wood shakes and shingles]</ref> However, young growth redcedar has a short life expectancy. High cost. Should be allowed to breathe.<ref>[http://hometips.com/content/shingle_intro.html Hometips - Wooden shingle roofing, with good diagrams]</ref> ** [[Hardwood]]. Very durable roofing found in Colonial [[Australian architecture]], its use now limited to [[Building restoration|restorations]]. * [[Slate]]. High cost with a life expectancy of up to 200 years.<ref>[http://www.slateroofcentral.com/identify.html Slate Roof Central]</ref> Slate cleaves into thin sheets, making it much lighter than concrete tiles, though heavier than sheet steel and other light roof coverings. * Stone slab. Heavy stone slabs (not to be confused with slate) 1"-2" thick were formerly used as roofing tiles in some regions in England. Stone slabs require a very heavyweight roof structure, but their weight makes them stormproof. An obsolete roofing material. * Ceramic [[tile]]. High cost, life of more than 100 years.<ref>[http://www.claytileroof.com/contracting_services/historic_renovation.asp Renaissance Roofing]</ref> ** [[Imbrex and tegula]], style dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. ** [[Monk and Nun]], a style similar to Imbrex and tegula, but basically using two Imbrex tiles. * Metal shakes or shingles. Long life. High cost, suitable for roofs of 3/12 pitch or greater. Because of the flexibility of metal, they can be manufactured to lock together, giving durability and reducing assembly time.<ref>[http://hometips.com/cs-protected/guides/metal_roofs/metalroof_shingles.html HomeTips: Metal shingle roofing]</ref> * Mechanically seamed metal. Long life. High cost, suitable for roofs of low pitch such as 0.5/12 to 3/12 pitch. * [[Concrete]], usually reinforced with fibres of some sort. Concrete tiles require a stronger roof structure than slate, as some owners have found to their cost. * [[Asphalt shingle]], made of bitumen embedded in an organic or fiberglass mat, usually covered with colored, man-made ceramic grit. Cheaper than slate or tiles. Various life span expectancies. [[Image:DONE - DSC 2224.JPG|thumb|250px|right| A home in Avalon, NJ showing an Asphalt shingle roof. This is commonly found on most roofs.]] * [[Asbestos]] shingles. Very long lifespan, fireproof and low cost but now rarely used because of health concerns.<ref>[http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Asbestos_and_your_health?open Asbestos and Your Health, Victorian Government]</ref><ref>[http://www.asbestosdiseases.org.au/asbestosinfo/asbestos_community.htm Asbestos Diseases Advisory Service]</ref> * [[Membrane_roofing|Membrane Roofing]]. Membrane roofing is in large sheets, generally fused in some way at the joints to form a continuous surface. ** [[Thermoset membrane]] (e.g. [[EPDM rubber]]). Synthetic rubber sheets adhered together with contact adhesive or tape. Primary application is big box store with large open areas. ** [[Thermoplastic]] (e.g. [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[ThermoPlastic Olefin|TPO]], [[Hypalon|CSPE]]). Plastic sheets welded together with hot air creating one continuous sheet membrane. Can be rewelded with the exception of CSPE. Lends itself well to both big box and small roof application because of its hot air weldability. This membrane is installed by two methods: 1.) Rolls of membrane are attached to the ridged insulation using a bonding adhesive. 2.) The edge of each roll is fastened through ridged insulation into structural deck, and the proceeding roll is lapped over the fasteners. The overlap is then heat-welded with hot air to create a mechanically-fastened thermoplastic roof. ** Modified [[bitumen]] - heat welded, asphalt adhered or installed with adhesive. Asphalt is mixed with polymers such as APP or SBS, then applied to fiberglass and/or
