That is partly for perspective, and partly because some problems are best studied in non-vertex form, as for instance is edge coloring. The convention of using colors originates from coloring the countries of a map, where each face is literally colored. This was generalized to coloring the faces of a graph [[Graph embedding|embedded]] in the plane. By planar duality it became coloring the vertices, and in this form it generalizes to all graphs. In mathematical and computer representations it is typical to use the first few positive or nonnegative integers as the "colors". In general one can use any finite set as the "color set". The nature of the coloring problem depends on the number of colors but not on what they are. Graph coloring enjoys many practical applications as well as theoretical challenges. Beside the classical types of problems, different limitations can also be set on the graph, or on the way a color is assigned, or even on the color itself. It has even reached popularity with the general public in the form of the popular number puzzle [[Sudoku]]. Graph coloring is still a very active field of research. ''Note: Many terms used in this article are defined in [[Glossary of graph theory]].'' ==History== {{see also | History of the four color theorem | History of graph theory}} The first results about graph coloring deal almost exclusively with [[planar graphs]] in the form of the coloring of ''maps''. While trying to color a map of the counties of England, [[Francis Guthrie]] postulated the [[four color conjecture]], noting that four colors were sufficient to color the map so that no regions sharing a common border received the same color. Guthrie’s brother passed on the question to his mathematics teacher [[Augustus de Morgan]] at [[University College London|University College]], who mentioned it in a letter to [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] in 1852. [[Arthur Cayley]] raised the problem at a meeting of the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1879. The same year, [[Alfred Kempe]] published a paper that claimed to establish the result, and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved. For his accomplishment Kempe was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and later President of the London Mathematical Society.<ref>M. Kubale, ''History of graph coloring'', in {{harvtxt|Kubale|2004}}</ref> In 1890, [[Heawood]] pointed out that Kempe’s argument was wrong. However, in that paper he proved the [[five color theorem]], saying that every planar map can be colored with no more than ''five'' colors, using ideas of Kempe. In the following century, a vast amount of work and theories were developed to reduce the number of colors to four, until the four color theorem was finally proved in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]]. Perhaps surprisingly, the proof went back to the ideas of Heawood and Kempe and largely disregarded the intervening developments.<ref>{{harvtxt|van Lint|Wilson|2001|loc=Chap. 33}}</ref> The proof of the four color theorem is also noteworthy for being the first major computer-aided proof. In 1912, [[George David Birkhoff]] introduced the [[chromatic polynomial]] to study the coloring problems, which was generalised to the [[Tutte polynomial]] by [[Tutte]], important structures in [[algebraic graph theory]]. Kempe had already drawn attention to the general, non-planar case in 1879,<ref>{{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}}, p. 2</ref> and many results on generalisations of planar graph coloring to surfaces of higher order followed in the early 20th century. In 1960, [[Claude Berge]] formulated another conjecture about graph coloring, the ''strong perfect graph conjecture'', originally motivated by an [[information theory|information-theoretic]] concept called the zero-error capacity of a graph introduced by [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]. The conjecture remained unresolved for 40 years, until it was established as the celebrated [[strong perfect graph theorem]] in 2002 by [[Maria Chudnovsky|Chudnovsky]], [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Robertson]], [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Seymour]], [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Thomas]] 2002. Graph coloring has been studied as an algorithmic problem since the early 1970s: the chromatic number problem is one of [[Karp’s 21 NP-complete problems]] from 1972, and at approximately the same time various exponential-time algorithms were developed based on backtracking and on the deletion-contraction recurrence of {{harvtxt|Zykov|1949}}. One of the major applications of graph coloring, [[register allocation]] in compilers, was introduced in 1981. ==Definition and terminology==<!--[[Chromatic number]] redirects here--> [[Image:Graph with all three-colourings.svg|thumb|right|This graph can be 3-colored in 12 different ways.]] ===Vertex coloring=== When used without any qualification, a '''coloring''' of a graph is almost always a ''proper vertex coloring'', namely a labelling of the graph’s vertices with colors such that no two vertices sharing the same [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] have the same color. Since a vertex with a [[loop (graph theory)|loop]] could never be properly colored, it is understood that graphs in this context are loopless. The terminology of using ''colors'' for vertex labels goes back to map coloring. Labels like ''red'' and ''blue'' are only used when the number of colors is small, and normally it is understood that the labels are drawn from the integers {1,2,3,...}. A coloring using at most ''k'' colors is called a (proper) ''' ''k''-coloring'''. The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph ''G'' is called its '''chromatic number''', χ(''G''). A graph that can be assigned a (proper) ''k''-coloring is ''' ''k''-colorable''', and it is ''' ''k''-chromatic''' if its chromatic number is exactly ''k''. A subset of vertices assigned to the same color is called a ''color class'', every such class forms an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]]. Thus, a ''k''-coloring is the same as a partition of the vertex set into ''k'' independent sets, and the terms ''k-partite'' and ''k-colorable'' have the same meaning. ===Chromatic polynomial=== [[Image:Chromatic polynomial of all 3-vertex graphs.png|thumb|200px|All nonisomorphic graphs on 3 vertices and their chromatic polynomials. The empty graph ''E''<sub>3</sub> (red) admits a 1-coloring, the others admit no such colorings. The green graph admits 12 colorings with 3 colors.]] {{main|Chromatic polynomial}} The '''chromatic polynomial''' counts the number of ways a graph can be colored using no more than a given number of colors. For example, using three colors, the graph in the image to the right can be colored in 12 ways. With only two
