the copyright law in the 27 Member States of the European Union, while retaining compatibility with popular open-source software licences such as the [[GNU General Public License]]. The first IDABC software packages mentioned are [[CIRCA (software)|CIRCA]] groupware<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6540 CIRCA groupware]</ref>, [[IPM (software)|IPM]]<ref>[http://www.ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/ipmoss_en.htm IPM technical architecture]</ref><ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6541/5644 IPM EUPL]</ref> and the [[eLink]]<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/4171/5644 eLink]</ref> [[Government-to-government|G2G]], [[G2C]], [[Government-to-business|G2B]] specification software. Since the launching (in October 2008) of the European Open Source Observatory and Repository (OSOR) <ref>[http://www.osor.eu]</ref>, a number of [[other software (software)|other software]]<ref>[https://forge.osor.eu/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=307]</ref>, mainly produced by European administrations, are licensed under the EUPL. ==Comparison to other open source/free software licences== With [[license proliferation|licence proliferation]] a growing problem, the European Union justifies its licence as the first open source licence to be released by an international governing body. The European Union also wishes to dispel legal uncertainties, real or perceived, in respect of other open-source licences, such as the GNU General Public License, by creating a software licence which takes due account of European Union Law. A third goal of this licence is to create an open-source licence available into 22 official languages of the European Union, and is sure to conform to the existing copyright laws of each of the 27 Member States of the European Union. Lastly, to dispel fears of licence proliferation, the licence was developed with other open-source licences in mind and specifically authorizes covered works to be re-released under the following licences, when combined with their covered code<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=27472 Study of the compatibility mechanism of the EUPL v.1.0]</ref>: <!--Somebody before me asked a question, here: if the EU removes one of these approved licenses from the list in a later version of the EUPL, would that make existing projects, using code taken from an EUPL-covered work but using it as, say, GPL, instantly illegal? Answer: no. If code has been released under the GPL once, it's GPL forever. If later versions of the same code use a different license, the new code may not be GPL, but the old code still is, and the same principle applies to the dual-license scenarios and the EUPL's compatibility clause.--> * [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) v. 2 * [[Open Software License]] (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0 * [[Common Public License]] v. 1.0 * [[Eclipse Public License]] v. 1.0 * [[CeCILL]] v. 2.0 ==Possible upgrade== According to the EUPL v.1.1, the European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of the EUPL, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. Future upgrades will not be applicable automatically when software was expressly released "under the EUPL v.1.1 only". New provisions cover the [[Application service provider]] loophole of software distribution: Distribution and/or Communication (of software) includes providing on-line "access to its essential functionalities". A possible issue that could use further thought is how the licence affects dynamic linking. This currently depends on national law. According to studies done prior to the approval of the EUPL, this is intentional: each case is left to appreciation.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/7340/469 Future upgrade]</ref>. ==Member States policies== As from 2010, EU Member States adopt or revise policies aimed to encourage - when appropriate - the open source distribution of public sector applications. The EUPL is formally mentioned in some of these policies: *[http://ictpolicies.gov.mt/docs/GMICT_P_0097_Open_Source_Software_v1.0.pdf Malta] *[http://www.csae.mpr.es/csi/pdf/ENI_INTEROPERABILITY_ENGLISH_final.pdf Spain] *[https://noiv.nl/actueel/nieuws/actueel/nieuws/2009/06/09/open-source-licentiewijzer-gelanceerd/ The Netherlands] == Notes == {{Reflist|group=note}} ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[OSOR.eu]] The EU Open Source Observatory and Repository (www.OSOR.eu) includes blogs on EUPL *[[Comparison of free software licences]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/7774.html European Union Public Licence - EUPL v.1.1] at [[IDABC]] *[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/7330.html European Union Public Licence (EUPL v.1.0)] at [[IDABC]] *[http://www.osor.eu/eupl/eupl-v1.1/en/EUPL%20v.1.1%20-%20Licence.pdf Full English text of the licence] ([[PDF]]) *[http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/82-3/Dusollier%20Author%20Approved%20Edits(H)(P).pdf Article of professor Severine Dusollier with a particular reference to the EUPL ] ([[PDF]]) *[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok100U4Fo3Y&NR=1.

Events can, but do not necessarily, cause state transitions from one [[State (computer science)|state]] to another in [[state machine]]s represented by [[state diagram|state machine diagram]]s. A transition between states occurs only when any [[guard condition]] for that transition are satisfied. {{Unreferenced|date=February 2009}} {{UML}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Event (Uml)}} [[Category:Unified Modeling Language]] [[Category:Data modeling]] {{uml-stub}} [[de:Ereignis (UML)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12646</id> <title>Event (synchronization primitive)</title> <text>In [[computer science]], an '''event''' (also called '''event semaphore''') is a type of [[synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] mechanism that is used to indicate to waiting processes when a particular condition has become true. An event is an [[abstract data type]] with a boolean state and the following operations: * '''wait''' - when executed, causes the executing process to suspend until the event's state is set to true. If the state is already set to true has no effect. * '''set''' - sets the event's state to true, release all waiting processes. * '''clear''' - sets the event's state to false. Different implementations of events may provide different subsets of these possible operations; for example, the implementation provided by [[Microsoft Windows]] provides the operations '''wait''' (WaitForObject and related functions), '''set''' (SetEvent), and '''clear''' (ResetEvent). An option that may be specified during creation of the event object changes the behaviour of SetEvent so that only a single process is released and the state is automatically returned to false after that process is released. Events are similar in principle to the ''condition variables'' used in [[monitor (synchronization)|monitors]], although the precise mechanism of use is somewhat different. == External links == * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682655(VS.85).aspx Event Objects], ''Microsoft Developer Network'' * [http://effbot.org/zone/thread-synchronization.htm Thread Synchronization Mechanisms in Python] {{compsci-stub}} [[Category:Concurrency control]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12659</id>
