would be enforced in a receiver is not yet clear. One candidate approach could be the DVB-CPCM standard. There is no European equivalent to the US FCC to create and enforce regulations, so a coherent multinational legal framework is hard to imagine at this time. In the UK the BBC introduced content protection restrictions in Summer 2010 on Free to Air content by licensing data necessary to receive the service information for the Freeview HD broadcasts. However the BBC have stated the highest protection applied will be to allow only one copy to be made. ===ISDB=== [[ISDB]] broadcasts are protected as to allow the broadcast to be digitally recorded once, but to not allow digital copies of the recording to be made. Analog recordings can be copied freely. It is possible to disallow the use of analog outputs, although this has yet to be implemented. The protection can be circumvented with the correct hardware and software. === DVB-CPCM === The Digital Video Broadcasting organization is developing [[DVB-CPCM]] which allows broadcasters (especially PayTV broadcaster) far more control over the use of content on (and beyond) home networks. The DVB standards are commonly used in Europe and around the world (for satellite, terrestrial, and cable distribution), but are also employed in the United States by [[Dish Network]]. In Europe, some entertainment companies are lobbying to legally mandate the use of DVB-CPCM in the next level of the controversial [[EU Copyright directive]]. Opponents fear that mandating DVB-CPCM will kill independent receiver manufacturers that use open source operating systems (e.g., Linux-based set-top boxes.) Should the US broadcast flag return, CPCM would be a candidate for addition to the Table A list of approved technologies for enforcement in the US. ===Pay-per-view movies on Cable Provider Provided DVRs=== Since April 15, 2008, [[pay-per-view]] [[movie]]s on [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] have been flagged so that recordings cannot stay on [[digital video recorder]]s or other related devices sold or leased to you from your cable or satellite provider for more than 24 hours after the movie begins. The change was a result of negotiations between the major [[movie studio]]s and the PPV providers. Movies recorded before April 15 may still be available from the device.<ref>http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPage.jsp?assetId=P4540022</ref> This does not affect customers who own their own DVRs not provided by the cable or satellite provider, although it may be difficult and require manual intervention to record PPV content on these devices. However with the natural progression of cable providers to provide movies on their [[video on demand]] services and discontinue pay-per-view movie channels, this issue should fade in the next few years.{{or|date=January 2011}} == See also == * [[Copy Control Information]] Related intellectual property subjects * [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] * [[Digital Transition Content Security Act]] * [[Family Entertainment and Copyright Act]] == References == <references/> * {{Cite web | title = Digital Broadcast Television Redistribution Control | url = http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/13nov20061500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/octqtr/pdf/47cfr73.9002.pdf | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | accessdate = 2007-04-05 }}, October 1, 2005. == External links == Related to legal or technological status of the Broadcast flag * [http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/45183.pdf Copyright Protection of Digital Television: The “Broadcast Flag”] * [http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/ Electronic Frontier Foundation's Broadcast Flag page] * [http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/HDTV/ The Broadcast Flag and "Plug & Play": The FCC's Lockdown of Digital Television] * [http://news.com.com/Court+says+FCCs+broadcast+flag+is+toast/2100-1030_3-5697719.html U.S. District Court shoots down broadcast flag (CNET)] *[http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/5002/broadcastflag.html Broadcast Flag: Media Industry May Try to Steal the Law] - June 2005 [[MP3 Newswire]] article * [http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200505/04-1037b.pdf Circuit Court ruling striking down (PDF format)] {{Broadcast encryption}} {{North American DTV}} {{Video formats}} [[Category:ATSC]] [[Category:Digital television]] [[Category:High-definition television]] [[Category:Digital rights management]] [[Category:Federal Communications Commission]] [[de:Broadcast Flag]] [[es:Broadcast flag]] [[it:Broadcast flag]] [[ja:ブロードキャストフラグ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4602</id> <title>BrookGPU</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = BrookGPU | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | collapsible = | author = | developer = | released = | latest release version = | latest release date = | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = | operating system = [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] | platform = | size = | language = | status = | genre = Compiler/Runtime | license = [[BSD license]] (parts are under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]) | website = http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/brookgpu/ }} '''BrookGPU''' is the [[Stanford University]] Graphics group's compiler and runtime implementation of the [[Brook (programming language)|Brook]] [[Stream processing|stream programming]] language for using modern graphics hardware for non-graphical, [[GPGPU|general purpose computations]]. It can be used to program highly parallel [[GPU|graphics processing units]] such as those found on [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] or [[Nvidia]] graphics cards or increasingly [[Intel]]'s integrated graphics solutions. BrookGPU compiles programs written using the [[Brook (programming language)|Brook]] [[Stream processing|stream programming]] language, which is a variant of [[ANSI C]]. It can use [[OpenGL]] v1.3+, [[DirectX]] v9+ or AMD's [[Close to Metal]] for the computational backend and runs on both [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and possibly [[Mac OS X]]. It can also simulate a virtual graphics card by itself via a special [[Central processing unit|CPU]] backend which is useful for debugging Brook kernels. Unlike most increasingly proprietary GPGPU frameworks currently available, [[Brook (programming language)|Brook]] is licensed under the [[BSD license]] (parts are under the [[GNU General Public License]]) and is free software. This makes it ideal for students interested in GPGPU programming without having to delve into OpenGL or DirectX implementation details. ==Status== [[Brook (programming language)|Brook]] has been in [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] for a long time. The last major beta release (v0.4) was in October 2004 but renewed development began and stopped again in November 2007 with a v0.5 beta 1 release. The new features of v0.5 include a much upgraded and faster [[OpenGL]] backend which uses framebuffer objects instead of PBuffers and harmonised the code around standard OpenGL interfaces instead of using proprietary vendor extensions. [[GLSL]] support was added which brings all the functionality (complex branching and loops) previously only supported by DX9 to OpenGL. In particular, this means that Brook is now just as capable on [[Linux]] as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Other improvements in the v0.5 series include multi-backend
