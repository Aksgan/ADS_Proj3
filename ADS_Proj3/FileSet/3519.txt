table or spreadsheet and create a second table (called a "pivot table") displaying the summarized data. Pivot tables are also useful for quickly creating unweighted [[cross tabulation]]s. The user sets up and changes the summary's structure by [[drag and drop|dragging and dropping]] fields graphically. This "rotation" or pivoting of the summary table gives the concept its name. The term ''pivot table'' is a generic phrase used by multiple vendors. However, [[Microsoft Corporation]] has [[trademark]]ed the specific form ''PivotTable''.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/library/toolbar/3.0/trademarks/en-us.mspx Microsoft Trademarks]{{Failed verification|date=November 2009}}. </ref><ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=5nsLAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4&source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false | title = United States Patent number US 6,411,313 B1 | date = 2002-06-25 | publisher = | location = | page = 10 | accessdate = 2010-02-16 | quote = PivotTable is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation. }} </ref> Pivot tables can be seen as a simplification of the more complete and complex [[Online analytical processing|OLAP concepts]]. ==History== In their book ''Pivot Table Data Crunching'',<ref> {{cite book |first1= Bill |last1=Jelen |author1-link= Bill Jelen |first2= Michael |last2= Alexander |author2-link= |title= Pivot table data crunching |year= 2006 |publisher= Que |location= Indianapolis |isbn= 0789734354 |page= |pages= 274 |quote= }} </ref> authors Bill Jelen and Mike Alexander call [[Pito Salas]] the "father of pivot tables". While working on a concept for a new program which would eventually become [[Lotus Improv]], Salas realized that spreadsheets have patterns of data. A tool that could help the user recognize these patterns would help to build advanced data models quickly. With Improv, users could define and store sets of categories, then change views by dragging category names with the mouse. This core functionality would provide the model for pivot tables. [[Lotus Development]] released Improv in 1991 on the [[NeXT]] platform. A few months after the release of Improv, [[Brio Technology]] published a standalone Mac implementation called DataPivot (with technology patented in 1999<ref> {{Citation | title = Patent #5915257 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=CAMDAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4&source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false | last1 = Gartung | first1 = Daniel L. | last2 = Edholm | first2 = Yorgen H. | last3 = Edholm | first3 = Kay-Martin | last4 = McNall | first4 = Kristen N. | last5 = Lew | first5 = Karl M. | accessdate = 2010-02-16 }} </ref>). [[Borland]] purchased the DataPivot technology in [[1992]] and implemented it in their own spreadsheet application [[Quattro Pro]]. In 1993, at the time when the Windows version of Improv appeared, [[Microsoft Excel]] 5 was already on the market with a new functionality called a “PivotTable”. This functionality was further improved in later Excel versions: * Excel 97 included a new and improved PivotTable Wizard, the ability to create calculated fields, and new pivot cache objects that allow developers to code against pivot tables. * Excel 2000 introduced “Pivot Charts” to graphically represent pivot table data. ==Explanation of a pivot table== For typical data entry and storage, data usually appear in ''flat'' tables, meaning that it consists of only columns and rows, as in the following example showing data on shirt types: [[File:pivottable-Flatdata.PNG]] While such data can contain a lot of [[information]], it can be difficult to get summarized information. A pivot table can help quickly summarize the data and highlight the desired information. The usage of a pivot table is extremely broad and depends on the situation. The first question to ask is, "What am I looking for?" In the example here, let us ask, "How many ''Units'' did we sell in each ''Region'' for every ''Ship Date?''": [[File:pivottable-Pivoted.PNG]] A pivot table usually consists of ''row'', ''column'', and ''data'' (or ''fact'') fields. In this case, the column is ''Ship Date'', the row is ''Region'', and the data we would like to see is ''Units''. These fields allow several kinds of aggregations including: sum, average, [[standard deviation]], count, etc. In this case, the total number of units shipped is displayed here using a ''sum'' aggregation. ==How a pivot table works== Using the example above, software will find all distinct records for ''Region''. In this case, they are: ''North'', ''South'', ''East'', ''West''. Furthermore, it will find all distinct records for ''Ship Date''. Based on the aggregation type, ''sum'', it will summarize the ''fact'', and display them in a multidimensional chart. In the example above, the first data point is 66. This number was obtained by finding all records where both ''Region'' was ''East'' and ''Ship Date'' was ''1/31/2005'', and adding the ''Units'' of that collection of records together to get a final result. ==Application support== Pivot tables are an integral part of a [[List of spreadsheets|spreadsheet application]]. In addition to Microsoft Excel, competing software programs such as [[OpenOffice.org Calc]] provide similar functionality; the OpenOffice.org implementation is called [[OpenOffice.org Calc#DataPilot|DataPilot]]. Other companies such as [[numberGo]] and [[Quantrix]] provide similar implementations. Pivot functionality also operates in other data visualization tools, including [[business intelligence]] packages. [[Google Docs]] allows the creation of basic pivot tables, via the pivot table [[Google Gadgets|gadget]] from Panorama, but {{as of | 2010 | lc = on }} it provides limited functionality. ==As an OLAP client== Excel Pivot Tables includes the feature to directly query an [[OLAP]] server for retrieving data instead of getting the data from an Excel spreadsheet. On this configuration a pivot table is a simple client of an OLAP server. Excel's Pivot Table not only allows for connecting to Microsoft's solution (Analysis Service), but to any [[XML_for_Analysis|XMLA]] (OLAP standard) compliant server. Other OLAP clients are JPivot, Dundas, IcCube (Client Library). ==See also== * [[Comparison of office suites]] * [[Data drilling]] * [[Comparison of OLAP Servers]] * [[OLAP cube]] * [[Group by (SQL)]] * [[Contingency table]] ==References== {{reflist}} == Further reading == * ''A Complete Guide to PivotTables: A Visual Approach'' (ISBN 1-59059-432-0) ([http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/19/2012256 in-depth review at slashdot.org]) * ''Excel 2007 PivotTables and PivotCharts: Visual blueprint'' (ISBN 978-0-470-13231-9) * ''Pivot Table Data Crunching'' (Business Solutions) (ISBN 0-7897-3435-4) * ''Beginning Pivot Tables in Excel 2007'' (ISBN 1-59059-890-3) ==External links== * [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVa7PIDfi5A PivotTable video for Excel 2007, including compatibility mode] * [http://www.microsoft.com/BusinessSolutions/excel_pivot_tables_collins.mspx Introduction to pivot tables by Microsoft Business Solutions] * [http://www.datapigtechnologies.com/ExcelMain.htm Video Tutorials by DataPig Technologies]
