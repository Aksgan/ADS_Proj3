Estimating the expenses of defending the continental colonies and the [[British West Indies]] to be approximately £200,000 annually, the British goal after the end of this war was that the colonies would be taxed for £78,000 of this amount. The colonists objected chiefly on the grounds not that the taxes were high (they were low)<ref>Englishmen paid on average twenty-five shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (1943) p. 89</ref> but that they had no representation in the Parliament. Parliament insisted it had the right to levy any tax without colonial approval, to demonstrate that it had authority over the colonies.<ref>Middlekauff p. 62</ref> The colonists did not object to the principle of contributing to the cost of their defense (colonial legislatures spent large sums raising and outfitting militias during the French and Indian War), but they disputed the need for the Crown to station regular British troops in North America. In the absence of a French threat, colonists believed the colonial militias (which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures) to be sufficient. Officer positions were in high demand among the British aristocracy—the rank of captain or major sold for thousands of pounds, and could be resold once an officer purchased an even higher rank.<ref name="Shy, Toward Lexington 2008">Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' (2008) pp 69-73</ref> The British wanted all the commissions for themselves, and were unwilling to commission colonial officers who would pay nothing for their commissions, nor would they recognize colonial commissions, effectively negating the will or the legal authority of the colonies to contribute to defense in that sort of way. With some 1,500 well-connected British officers who would have become redundant in the aftermath of the Seven Years War, London would have had to discharge them if they did not assign them to North America.<ref>Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' 73-78</ref> Therefore the main reason for Parliament imposing taxes was to prove its supremacy, and the main use of the tax funds would be patronage for ambitious British officers.<ref>Bernhard Knollenberg, ''Origin of the American Revolution: 1759-1766'' (1960) pp 76-87</ref> The slogan "[[No taxation without representation]]" summed up the American position. London responded that [[virtual representation|the colonists were "virtually represented"]]; but most Americans rejected this.<ref>William S. Carpenter, "Taxation Without Representation" in ''Dictionary of American History, Volume 7'' (1976); Miller (1943)</ref> In 1764, Parliament enacted the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Currency Act]], further vexing the colonists. Protests led to a powerful new weapon, the systematic [[boycott]] of British goods. The following year, the British enacted the [[Quartering Acts]], which required British soldiers to be quartered at the expense of residents in certain areas. Colonists objected to this, as well. In 1765 the Stamp Act was the first [[direct tax]] levied on the colonies by British Prime Minister [[George Grenville]] and the Parliament. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets— decks of playing cards—were required to have the stamps. The colonists still considered themselves loyal subjects of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]], with the same historic rights and obligations as subjects in Britain.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 11</ref> Nevertheless, representatives of all 13 colonies protested vehemently, as popular leaders such as Patrick Henry in Virginia and James Otis in Massachusetts, rallied the people in opposition. A secret group, the "[[Sons of Liberty]]" formed in many towns and threatened violence if anyone sold the stamps, and no one did.<ref>Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution'' (1991) pp. 77-112</ref> In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice-admiralty court and looted the home of the chief justice, [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in [[New York City]] in October 1765. Moderates led by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] drew up a "[[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their [[Rights of Englishmen]]. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise. In London, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Rockingham]] government came to power and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax, but in the [[Declaratory Act]] of March 1766 insisted that parliament retained full power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever".<ref name = "Miller1943"/> ====1767–1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act==== {{Main|Townshend Acts|Tea Act}} {{See|Massachusetts Circular Letter|Boston Massacre|Boston Tea Party}} [[File:Gaspee Affair.jpg|thumb|alt=Burning of the Gaspée|Burning of the ''[[Gaspée Affair|Gaspée]]'']] In 1767, the Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]], which placed a
