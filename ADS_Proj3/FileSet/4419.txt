''[[The Matrix]]'' was released in March 1999; after its success, two sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', were released in 2003. The characters and settings of the Matrix [[fictional universe]] are further explored in other media, including [[animation]], [[comic book]]s, and [[video game]]s. The series depicts a [[cyberpunk]] story incorporating numerous references to [[philosophy|philosophical]] and religious ideas. Other influences include [[mythology]], [[anime]], and [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] (particularly "[[heroic bloodshed]]" and [[martial arts film|martial arts]] movies). The fight choreographer for the trilogy was [[Yuen Wo-ping]]. <!-- On January 24, 2011, it was revealed by Keanu Reeves that the [[Wachowski brothers|Wachowskis]] told him that they completed script treatments for two more "Matrix" installments. They are planning to make the films in 3D and have already met with [[James Cameron]] to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the technology.<ref>http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=20424</ref> This, however, turned out to be a hoax.<ref>http://screenrant.com/matrix-4-5-bill-and-ted-3-keanu-reeves-rob-97796</ref> --> ==Overview== In the [[dystopia]] the series depicts, Earth is dominated by [[artificial intelligence|sentient machines]]. Humans are grown in pods and are connected by cybernetic implants to an [[Virtual reality|artificial reality]] called the Matrix, which keeps their minds under control while the machines use the [[bioelectricity]] and [[thermal energy]] of their bodies as an energy source. The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The majority of the films and games of the ''Matrix'' franchise take place in a vast [[Mega City (The Matrix)|unnamed megacity]], although it is not the only city within the Matrix, as other familiar locations are mentioned and visited by the characters during the trilogy and [[the Animatrix]]. As this environment is practically indistinguishable from reality, except when a slight green tinge appears (becoming more prominent as the series continues), the majority of humans connected to the Matrix are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series know that it is not 'real' and as a result can partially bend the simulation's physical laws in order to perform [[superhuman]] feats within the simulation. The virtual world is first introduced in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The ''[[The Animatrix|Animatrix]]'' short film "[[The Second Renaissance]]", and the short comic [http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_middles1_wachdarrtframe.html "Bits and Pieces of Information"] show how the initial conflict between humans and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. The films include numerous and varied references to literary, philosophical and religious works. Notable examples include references to the "White Rabbit" and the "Rabbit Hole", referencing Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" along with the use of a mirror as a portal to another world as explored in Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass". Biblical and historical references are found in the names of places and vehicles in the Trilogy, such as the "hovercraft" named "Nebuchadnezzar". Though it is not clear whether this name refers to either of the Babylonian Kings of the same name, or merely shares the literal meaning "Nabu (god of wisdom), preserve/defend my firstborn son", which could refer to the ships role in the protection of "The One". Another notable name is the City of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], often used as a [[synecdoche]] for the City of Jerusalem or the land of Israel in Abrahamic religious texts, or to refer to a "[[promised land]]" or [[utopia]]. ==Films== {{Main|The Matrix|The Matrix Reloaded|The Matrix Revolutions}} The series began with 1999's '''''[[The Matrix]]'''''. The film, directed by the [[Wachowski brothers]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]], was highly successful, earning $460 million worldwide. In addition, by 2000, the DVD release of the film reached three million sales, the first DVD release in [[North America]] to do so.<ref name="dvdsales">''[http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html "Press release - August 1, 2000 - The Matrix DVD: The first to sell 3 million"].

These were filmed simultaneously during one [[filmmaking#Production|shoot]], and released in two parts in 2003. The sequels were produced under the project codename "The Burly Man"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html |title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> |author=Steve Silberman |date = May 2003|work=Wired |publisher=Wired Digital/[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> (which later led to the name of the Wachowski brothers' comic book production company, [[Burlyman Entertainment]]). The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack of the human enclave of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] by a vast machine army. Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix, his role as the One and the prophecy that he will end the war. The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects. ==Additional media== ===Anime=== {{Main|The Animatrix}}
