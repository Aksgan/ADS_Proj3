It educates over 1,000 students and is one of a minority of [[high school]]s with a [[sixth form]]. The school is part of the Letchworth Sixth Form Consortium with [[The Highfield School]].<ref name="Ofsted main">[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/portal/site/Internet/menuitem.7c7b38b14d870c7bb1890a01637046a0/?urn=117504&providerCategoryID=8192 "Fernhill School"], Fearnhill School, [[Office for Standards in Education|Ofsted]], ''accessed 29 May 2008''</ref> It is situated in the west of Letchworth, just north of the [[Great Northern Route|railway line]] to Baldock and Cambridge. It is on the [[Icknield Way]]. ==History== The school's origins lie in '''Letchworth Grammar School''', which moved to the site in the early 1970s. ==Academic standards== The school is notable for leading the way in personal finance education.<ref>[http://nds.coi.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=359764&NewsAreaID=2 "Fearnhill School leads the way in teaching students how to better manage their money "], Ofsted, 12 March 2008</ref> The [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] results announced in August 2005 were the best since 2001. 59% of the students achieved A*-C grades.<ref>[http://www.thecomet.net/content/comet/news/story.aspx?brand=CMTOnline&category=News&tBrand=herts24&tCategory=newscomnew&itemid=WEED26%20Aug%202005%2010%3A17%3A20%3A217 "North Herts GCSE Results"], The Comet 24, 26 August 2005</ref> In 2009, it received GCSE results slightly under the England average, and A-level results well under average. ==Sport== Fearnhill has very successful [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] teams.

More specifically, features can refer to * the result of a general [[neighborhood operation]] (feature extractor or [[feature detector]]) applied to the image, * specific structures in the image itself, ranging from simple structures such as points or edges to more complex structures such as objects. Other examples of features are related to motion in image sequences, to shapes defined in terms of curves or boundaries between different image regions, or to properties of such a region. The feature concept is very general and the choice of features in a particular computer vision system may be highly dependent on the specific problem at hand. ==Introduction== When features are defined in terms of local neighborhood operations applied to an image, a procedure commonly referred to as ''feature extraction'', one can distinguish between [[feature detection]] approaches that produce local decisions whether there is a feature of a given type at a given image point or not, and those who produce non-binary data as result. The distinction becomes relevant when the resulting detected features are relatively sparse. Although local decisions are made, the output from a feature detection step does not need to be a binary image. The result is often represented in terms sets of (connected or unconnected) coordinates of the image points where features have been detected, sometimes with subpixel accuracy. When feature extraction is done without local decision making, the result is often referred to as a ''feature image''. Consequently, a feature image can be seen as an image in the sense that it is a function of the same spatial (or temporal) variables as the original image, but where the pixel values hold information about image features instead of intensity or color. This means that a feature image can be processed in a similar way as an ordinary image generated by an image sensor. Feature images are also often computed as integrated step in algorithms for [[feature detection]]. ==Feature representation== A specific image feature, defined in terms of a specific structure in the image data, can often be represented in different ways. For example, an [[Edge (geometry)|edge]] can be represented as a [[boolean variable]] in each image point that describes whether an edge is present at that point. Alternatively, we can instead use a representation which provides a [[certainty measure]] instead of a
