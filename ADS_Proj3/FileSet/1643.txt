Veasey | launch date = November 5, 1995 | current status = Active | alexa = 503 (January 2011) }} '''GameFAQs''' is a [[website]] that hosts [[FAQ]]s and [[walkthrough]]s for [[video game]]s. It was created in November 1995 by Jeff "CJayC" Veasey and was bought by [[CNET Networks]] in May 2003. It is currently owned by [[CBS Interactive]]. The site has a database of video game information, [[cheat code]]s, [[review]]s, [[saved game|game saves]], and [[screenshot]]s, almost all of which is submitted by volunteer contributors. The [[video game console|systems]] covered include the 8-bit [[Atari 2600|Atari]] platform through [[history of video game consoles (seventh generation)|modern consoles]], as well as [[personal computer game|computer games]]. Submissions made to the site are reviewed by the site's current editor, Allen "SBAllen" Tyner. GameFAQs hosts an active [[Internet forum|message board]] community, which has a separate discussion board for each game in the site's database, along with a variety of other boards. Since 2004, most of the game-specific boards have been shared between GameFAQs and [[GameSpot]], another CNET/CBS website. The site also runs a daily [[opinion poll]] and tournament contests. GameFAQs has been positively reviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]''<ref>{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Schofield | title=Games watch | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2000/may/11/onlinesupplement11 | work=[[The Guardian]] | id={{ISSN|0261-3077}} | page=11 | date=2000-05-11 | accessdate=2007-08-06 | quote=SPOnG, the Super Players Online Gamesbase, would like to become to games what the Internet Movie Database is to films.
