there are two distinct practitioners' communities that never talk to each other. Agent based modeling until recently has been mostly a purely academic topic. However, the increasing demand for global business optimization caused leading modelers looking at combined approaches to gain a deeper insight into complex interdependent processes having very different natures. How modeling approaches correspond to the abstraction levels. System dynamics dealing with aggregates is obviously used at the highest abstraction level. Discrete event modeling is used at low to middle abstraction. As for agent based modeling, this technology is used across all abstraction levels, and agent may model objects of very diverse nature and scale: at the "physical" level agents may be e.g. pedestrians or cars or robots, at the middle level – customers, at the highest level – competing companies<ref>Yuri G. Karpov. [http://www.itlab.unn.ru/Uploads/AnyLogicNizhniNovgorod2004.pdf "AnyLogic – a New Generation Professional Simulation Tool"], ''VI International Congress on Mathematical Modeling'', September 20-26th, 2004, NizniNovgorog, Russia</ref>. AnyLogic allows the modeler to combine these simulation approaches within the same model. There is no fixed hierarchy. So, as an example, one could create a model of the package shipping industry where carriers are modeled as agents acting/reacting independently whereas the inner workings of their transport and infrastructure networks could be modeled with discrete event simulation. Similarly, one can model consumers as agents whose aggregate behavior feed a systems dynamics model capturing flows such as revenues or costs which do not need to be tied to individual agents. This mixed language approach is directly applicable to a wide variety of complex modeling problems that may be modeled via any one approach albeit with compromises. ==Simulation language== [[Image:AnyLogic Simulation Language.jpg|thumb | 500px| right |Simulation language constructions provided by AnyLogic]] The AnyLogic simulation language consists of following items<ref name="e-help">[http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/ AnyLogic on-line help on official vendor web-site]</ref>: * '''Stock & Flow Diagrams''' are used for System Dynamics modeling. * '''[[State machine|Statecharts]]''' are used mostly in Agent Based modeling to define agent behavior. They are also often used in Discrete Event modeling, e.g. to simulate machine failure. * '''Action charts''' are used to define algorithms. They may be used in Discrete Event modeling, e.g. for call routing, or in Agent Based modeling, e.g. for agent decision logic. * '''Process flowcharts''' are the basic construction used to define process in Discrete Event modeling. Looking at this flowchart you may see why Discrete Event style is often called Process Centric. The language also includes: low level modeling constructions (variables, equations, parameters, events etc.), presentation shapes (lines, polylines, ovals etc.), analysis facilities (datasets, histograms, plots), connectivity tools, standard images, and experiments frameworks. ==AnyLogic libraries== AnyLogic includes the following standard libraries<ref name="e-help" />: * '''The Enterprise Library''' is designed to support DE simulation in Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Logistics and Healthcare areas. Using the Enterprise Library objects you can model real-world systems in terms of entities (transactions, customers, products, parts, vehicles, etc.), processes (sequences of operations typically involving queues, delays, resource utilization), and resources. The processes are specified in the form of flowcharts. * '''The Pedestrian Library''' is dedicated to simulate pedestrian flows in a "physical" environment. It allows you to create models of pedestrian-intensive buildings (like subway stations, security checks etc.) or streets (large numbers of pedestrians). Models support statistics collection on pedestrian density in different areas. This ensures acceptable performance of service points with a hypothetical load, estimates lengths of stay in specific areas, and detects potential problems with interior geometry – such as the effect of adding too many obstacles - and other applications. In models created with the Pedestrian Library pedestrians move in continuous space, reacting to different kinds of obstacles (walls, different kinds of areas) as well as other pedestrians. Pedestrians are simulated as interacting agents with complex behavior, but the AnyLogic Pedestrian Library provides a higher-level interface for fast creation of pedestrian models in the style of flowcharts. * '''The Rail Library''' supports modeling, simulating and visualizing operations of a rail yard of any complexity and scale. The rail yard models can be combined with discrete event or agent based models related to: loading and unloading, resource allocation, maintenance, business processes, and other transportation activities. Beside of these standard libraries user can create his own libraries and distribute them. == See also == * [[Comparison of agent-based modeling software]] * [[List of computer simulation software]] * [[List of discrete event simulation software]] * [[Computer simulation]] == References == {{reflist|3}} == Further reading == * {{cite book|last=Law|first=Averill M.|title=Simulation Modeling and Analysis with Expertfit Software |year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Science|id=ISBN 978-0-07-329441-4}} * {{cite book|last=Banks|first=Jerry|coauthors=John Carson, Barry Nelson, David Nicol|title=Discrete-event system simulation - 4th edition|year=2004|publisher=Prentice Hall|id=ISBN 978-0-13-144679-3}} * {{cite book|last=Sterman|first=John D.|title=Business Dynamics: Systems thinking and modeling for a complex world|year=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|id=ISBN 0-07-231135-5}} == External links == {{Wikibooks|Simulation with AnyLogic}} * [http://www.anylogic.com AnyLogic official web-site] * [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/ AnyLogic On-line Help] * [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/resources/book/ The Big Book of AnyLogic] * [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/resources/videos/ AnyLogic Video Tour (How-to's, model examples etc.)] * [http://simulation123.com/index.php?board=12.0 Anylogic support at simulation123.com] {{DEFAULTSORT:Anylogic}} [[Category:Simulation software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[Category:Linux software]] [[Category:Agent-based software]] [[Category:2000 software]] [[de:AnyLogic]] [[es:AnyLogic]] [[fa:انی‌لاجیک]] [[fr:AnyLogic]] [[lt:AnyLogic]] [[hu:AnyLogic]] [[ja:AnyLogic]] [[pt:AnyLogic]] [[ro:AnyLogic]] [[ru:AnyLogic]] [[sv:AnyLogic]] [[zh:AnyLogic]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2046</id> <title>Anyonic Lie algebra</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], an '''anyonic [[Lie algebra]]''' is a ''U''(1) graded [[vector space]] ''L'' over '''C''' equipped with a bilinear operator [.,.] and [[linear]] [[map (mathematics)|map]]s ε:L->'''C''' and Δ:L -> L⊗L satisfying * ε([''X'',''Y'']) = ε(''X'')ε(''Y'') # for pure graded [[pure element|element]]s ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z''. ==See also== *[[Lie algebra]] *[[Anyon]] ==References== {{unreferenced|date=June 2008}} [[Category:Algebra]] {{algebra-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>2059</id> <title>Apache Cassandra</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Apache Cassandra | logo = [[Image:Cassandra logo.png|250px]] | screenshot = | caption = | author = Avinash Lakshman, Prashant Malik | developer = [[Apache Software Foundation]] | released = 2008 | status = Active | latest release version = 0.7.0 | latest release date = {{release date|2011|01|09}} | latest preview version = none | latest preview date = n/a | frequently updated = yes | programming language = [[Java (programming language)|Java]] | operating system = [[Cross-platform]] | language = English | genre = [[Column-oriented DBMS]]
