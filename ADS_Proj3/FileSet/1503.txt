be completed in 2010. It is expected to reach the TOP10 of the most powerful supercomputers in the world when it reaches full capacity. The supercomputer is physically hosted at [[CESGA]]. [[Image:Finisterrae.png|thumb|left|'''FinisTerrae''' Distribution Diagram]] == Overview == The main Finisterrae characteristics are depicted on the following table: {| class="wikitable" |- | Name | Finisterrae |- | Place | [[CESGA]] |- | Country | [[Spain]] |- | Year | 2007 |- | OS | Linux |- | Architecture | [[Itanium 2]] [[64-bit|64]] ([[Intel]]) |- | Processors | 2400 |- | Memory | 19584 [[gigabyte|GB]] |- | Power | 12970 G[[FLOPS]] |- | Top500 Ranking | 100 |- | Web | www.cesga.es |- |} One of the special characteristic about this supercomputer is the ratio between cores and RAM memory. This was one reason why it received the denomination of "singular technical and scientific installation" from the Spanish government, a denomination given to some installations which have some value that makes them singular in some way. Some of those installations include the Canary Island grand telescope, or the Alba synchrotron. Even if this is the third fastest supercomputer in Spain, some projects that require special amounts of memory cannot be held by the first or second supercomputer, and therefore must be executed on the Finisterrae. == Architecture == [[Image:Finisterrae2.jpg|thumb|left|'''FinisTerrae''' Architecture]] [[Image:SuperDome.jpg|thumb|right|[[HP]] Integrity Superdome Nodes]] [[Image:NodosFinis.jpg|thumb|right|[[HP]]-SFS storage system Nodes]] [[Image:NodosHPIntegrityrx7640servers.jpg|thumb|right|[[HP]] Integrity RX7640 Nodes]] [[Image:HPesl712eTapeLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|[[HP]] ESL 712e Tape Library]] FinisTerrae supercomputer, located in [[CESGA]] is an integrated system by shared-memory nodes with and SMP NUMA architecture. FinisTerrae is composed of 144 computational nodes: * {{convert|142|HP|abbr=on}} [[HP Integrity]] [[rx7640]] nodes with 16 Itanium Montvale cores and 128 GB memory each one. * {{convert|1|HP|abbr=on}} Integrity Superdome node, with 128 Itanium Montvale cores and 1024 GB memory. * {{convert|1|HP|abbr=on}} Integrity Superdome node, with 128 Itanium 2 cores and 384 GB memory. An hierarchic storing system with: * 22 nodes for storing management with 96 processing cores. *The storage is connected to 72 cabins connected to 864 [[SATA]] disks, managed by [[Lustre]]. Backups are stored on tapes which provide 2.200.000 GB. *An interconnecting network between Infiniband 4x DDR at 20 Gbit/s nodes, providing 16 Gbit/s of effective bandwidth. * An external management Gigabit Ethernet network. * The nodes user [[SUSE]] Linux enterprise server as the Operating System. This operating system helped saving an important amount of money when comparing to other non-free options. * FinisTerrae includes open software and standard like: [[Linux]], [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]], Grid Engine and [[Globus Toolkit|Globus]]. *System also has next compilators, libraries and development tools: Intel C/C y [[Fortran]], Intel MKL, Vtune, HP-MPI y HP UPC. == Projects == As main purpose, the aim of the supercomputer is research. The supercomputer is mainly used by the three universities located in Galicia, (Universidade da Coruña, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela and Universidade de Vigo), as well as other research organizations like [[CSIC]]. The main projects hold by the supercomputer are divided into four fields: * Life sciences. * Nanotechnology. * Sea sciences. * Renewable energies. == Curiosities == *The machines need 140 square meters of space. * It weights around 33,5 tons. * The amount of cables used to interconnect the nodes is around 85 km, the distance between the supercomputer location (Santiago) and Finisterre. == External links, references == *[http://www.cesga.es CESGA] *[http://www.top500.org/system/details/9156 Details and rank at Top500 list] *[http://www.cesga.es/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,307/lang,gl/ Finisterrae Inauguration] {{Parallel Computing}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Finisterrae}} [[Category:Cluster computing]] [[Category:Supercomputers]] [[Category:Science and technology in Galicia]] [[Category:Spanish Supercomputing Network]] [[es:Finisterrae]] [[gl:Finisterrae]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13605</id> <title>Finitary relation</title> <text>{{Dablink|This article sets out the set-theoretic notion of relation. For a more elementary point of view, see [[Binary relation]]. For a combinatorial viewpoint, see [[Theory of relations]].}} {{Other uses|Relation (disambiguation)}} In [[set theory]] and [[logic]], a '''relation''' is a property that assigns truth values to [[tuple|k-tuples]] of individuals. Typically, the property describes a possible connection between the components of a ''k''-tuple. For a given [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of ''k''-tuples, a truth value is assigned to each ''k''-tuple according to whether the property does or does not hold. An example of a ''[[ternary relation]]'' (i.e., between three individuals) is: "''X'' <tt>was-introduced-to</tt> ''Y'' <tt>by</tt> ''Z''", where (X,Y,Z) is a 3-tuple of persons; for example, "[[Beatrice Wood]] was introduced to [[Henri-Pierre Roché]] by [[Marcel Duchamp]]" is true, while "[[Karl Marx]] was introduced to [[Friedrich Engels]] by [[Queen Victoria]]" is false. The variable ''k'' giving the number of "''places''" in the relation, 3 for the above example, is a [[non-negative]] [[integer]] (zero, one, two, ...), called the relation's ''[[arity]]'', ''adicity'', or ''[[dimension]]''. A relation with ''k'' places is variously called a ''k-ary'', a ''k-adic'', or a ''k-dimensional'' relation. Relations with a finite number of places are called ''finite-place'' or ''[[finitary]]'' relations. It is possible to generalize the concept to include ''infinitary'' relations between infinitudes of individuals, for example [[infinite sequence]]s; however, in this article only finitary relations are discussed, which will from now on simply be called relations. Since there is only one 0-tuple, the so-called empty tuple ( ), there are only two zero-place relations: the one that always holds, and the one that never holds. They are sometimes useful for constructing the base case of an [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument. One-place relations are called [[unary relation]]s. For instance, any set (such as the collection of [[Nobel laureates]]) can be viewed as a collection of individuals having some property (such as that of having been awarded the [[Nobel prize]]). Two-place relations are called [[binary relation]]s or ''dyadic relations''. The latter term has historic priority. [[Binary relation]]s are very common, given the ubiquity of relations such as: * [[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]], denoted by signs such as "=" and "<" in statements like "5 < 12"; * Being a [[divisor]] of, denoted by the sign "|" in statements like "13 | 1001"; * [[Element (mathematics)|Set membership]], denoted by the sign "&isin;" in statements like "1 &isin; '''N'''". A ''k-ary'' relation, ''k'' ≠ 2, is a straightforward generalization of a binary relation. ==Informal introduction== ''Relation'' is formally defined in the next section. In this section we introduce the
