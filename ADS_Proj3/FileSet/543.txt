It essentially brings buildings and structures to life. Building services engineers are responsible for the design, installation, operation and monitoring of the mechanical, electrical and public health systems required for the safe, comfortable and environmentally friendly operation of modern buildings. The term "building services engineering" is widely used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], however in the [[United States of America]], it is also known as [[architectural engineering]] or [[building engineering]]. ==Introduction== Building services engineering comprises [[Mechanical engineering]], [[Electrical engineering]] and Public health (MEP) engineering, all of which are further sub-divided into the following: * Communication lines, telephones and IT networks ([[Information technology|ICT]]) * [[Energy]] supply - [[gas]], [[electricity]] and [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources * [[Escalators]] and [[Elevator|lifts]] * [[Fire]] detection and protection * [[Heating]], [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[air conditioning]] ([[HVAC]]) * [[Lightning]] protection * [[Low voltage]] (LV) systems, [[distribution board]]s and [[switchgear]] * [[Natural lighting]] and [[artificial lighting]], and building [[facades]] * [[Security]] and [[alarm]] systems * [[ventilation (architecture)|Ventilation]] and [[refrigeration]] * [[Water]] , [[drainage]] and [[plumbing]] Building services [[engineer]]s work closely with other construction professionals; architects, structural engineers and quantity surveyors. They influence the [[architecture]] of a building and play a significant role on the [[sustainability]] and energy demand of a building. Within building services engineering, new roles are emerging, for example in the areas of renewable energy, sustainability, low carbon technologies and energy management. With buildings accounting for around 50% of all carbon emissions, building services engineers play a significant role in combating climate change. As such, a typical building services engineer has a wide-ranging career path: * '''Design:''' ''designing layouts and requirements for building services for residential or commercial developments.'' * '''Construction:''' ''supervising the construction of the building services, commissioning systems and ongoing maintenance and operation of services.'' * '''Environmental:''' ''developing new energy saving methods for construction, designing new and improved energy conservation systems for buildings.'' * '''Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)''': ''specialising in the design, development, construction and operation of HVAC systems.'' * '''Electrical technology:''' ''specialising in the design and development of electrical systems required for safe and energy sustaining operation of buildings.'' In 1976 [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] ([[CIBSE]]) was founded and received a Royal Charter in the [[United Kingdom]], and formally recognising building services engineering as a profession. Its objectives of the Institution are to: ''‘support the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work.''' In recent years there has been increasing emphasis on sustainable and green design by the UK government, including in engineered building systems. Building services engineers increasingly seek [[BREEAM]] (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), CIBSE Low Carbon Consultants (LCC) and Energy Assessors (LCEA) status in addition to their Professional Engineering registration. ==Building services engineering software== Many building services firms use computer-aided engineering (CAE) software programs, created either in-house or by external parties, to assist in their system design and analysis. This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of proposed solutions, the ability to create virtual models for analysis and calculations, and the ease of use in spatial planning. ==Education== Building services engineers typically possess an academic degree in either building services engineering, [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]]. The length of study for such a degree is usually three years for a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] ([[BEng]]) or [[Bachelor of Science]] ([[BSc]]) and four years for a [[Master of Engineering]] ([[MEng]]). Some of the degrees accredited by the [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] include: ===Bachelors=== * BSc (Hons) Integrated Technology (Building Services) ([[Doncaster College]]) * BSc in Building Services Engineering ([[Glasgow Caledonian University]]) * BSc (Hons) Building Services Engineering ([[Leeds Metropolitan University]]) * BSc (Hons) Building Services Engineering ([[London South Bank University]]) * BSc (Hons) Building Services Engineering ([[University of the West of England]]) * BSc (Hons) Architectural Engineering ([[Heriot-Watt University]]) * BEng (Hons) Building Services Engineering ([[The Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]) * BEng (Hons) Architectural Environment Engineering ([[University of Nottingham]]) ===Masters=== * MSc Building Services ([[UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL LANCASHIRE]]) * MEng Architectural and Environmental Design ([[University of Nottingham]]) * MEng Architectural Engineering ([[Heriot-Watt University]]) * Architectural Engineering ([[University of Strathclyde]]) * MEng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering (with Building Services Engineering) ([[The University of Manchester]]) * MEng Architectural Science and Engineering Services ([[The University of Manchester]]) * MSc Building Services Engineering ([[Loughborough University]]) * MEng Building Services Engineering ([[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]) * MEng Building Services and Energy Engineering ([[University of Ulster]]) * MEng Building Services Engineering ([[Northumbria University]]) * MSc Buildings and Environment ([[Czech Technical University in Prague]]) Courses accredited by other [[Engineering Institution]] in the UK such as the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) and the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] ([[IMechE]]) are also accepted and satisfy the education requirement to become a building services engineer. After completing an accredited degree program the engineer must also satisfy a range of other requirements (including work experience
