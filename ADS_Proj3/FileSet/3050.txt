It has multiple [[input/output]] (I/O) ports, in which a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] introduced at the input of any [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] appears at the output of every port except (usually) the original incoming. With multiple computers, the network slows, due to packet collisions. Lower prices of [[network switch]]es in the late 20th century made multiport repeaters rare. A multiport [[repeater]] usually performs regenerative functions, i.e., it reshapes the digital signals. ==See also== *[[Network hub]] ==References== *{{FS1037C}} [[Category:Networking hardware]] [[pl:Wtórnik]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25392</id> <title>Multireference configuration interaction</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} In [[quantum chemistry]], the '''multireference configuration interaction''' method consists in a [[configuration interaction]] expansion of the [[eigenstate]]s of the [[electronic molecular Hamiltonian]] in a set of [[Slater determinant]]s which correspond to excitations of the [[ground state]] [[electronic configuration]] but also of some [[excited state]]s. The Slater determinants from which the excitations are performed are called '''reference determinants'''. The higher excited derterminants (also called [[configuration state function]]s (CSFs) or shortly configurations) are then chosen either by the program according to some [[perturbation theory|perturbation theoretical]] [[ansatz]] according to a threshold provided by the user or simply by truncating excitations from these references to singly, doubly, ... excitations resulting in MRCIS, MRCISD, etc. For the ground state using more than one reference configuration means a better [[electronic correlation|correlation]] and so a lower energy. The problem of [[size consistency|size inconsistency]] of truncated CI-methods is not solved by taking more references. As a result of a MRCI calculation one gets a more balanced [[electronic correlation|correlation]] of the ground and [[excited state]]s. For quantitative good energy differences (excitation energies) one has to be careful in selecting the references. Taking only the dominant configuration of an excited state into the reference space leads to a correlated (lower) energy of the excited state. The generally too high excitation energies of CIS or CISD are lowered. But usually excited states have more than one dominant configuration and so the ground state is more correlated (due to a) now including some configurations with higher excitations (triply and quadruply in MRCISD) b) the neglect of other dominant configurations of the excited states which are still uncorrelated). Selecting the references can be done manually (<math> \Phi_1, \Phi_2, \Phi_5, ...</math>), automatically (all possible configurations within an active space of some orbitals) or semiautomatically (taking all configurations as references that have been shown to be important in a previous CI or MRCI calculation) This method has been implemented first by [[Robert Buenker]] and [[Sigrid D. Peyerimhoff]] in the seventies under the name '''Multi-Reference single and Double Configuration Interaction (MRDCI)'''. The MRCI method can also be implemented in [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical]] methods. An example for this is the OM2/MRCI method developed by [[Walter Thiel (Chemist)|Walter Thiel's]] group. ==See also== * [[Configuration interaction]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Multireference Configuration Interaction}} [[Category:Quantum chemistry]] <!-- [[Category:Computational chemistry]] redundant --> [[fr:Interaction de configuration multi-référence]] [[it:Multireference configuration interaction]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25395</id> <title>Multiscale Electrophysiology Format</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|orphan =December 2010|wikify =September 2009|refimprove =September 2009|copy edit=September 2009}} '''Multiscale Electrophysiology Format''' (MEF) was developed to handle the large amounts of data produced by large-scale electrophysiology in human and animal subjects. MEF can store any time series data up to 24 bits in length, and employs lossless range encoded difference compression. Subject identifying information in the file header can be encrypted using 128-bit AES encryption in order to comply with HIPAA requirements for patient privacy when transmitting data across an open network. Compressed data is stored in independent blocks to allow direct access to compressed data, facilitate parallel processing, and limit the effects of potential damage to file. Data fidelity is ensured by 32-bit cyclic redundancy check in each compressed data block using the Koopman polynomial (0xEB31D82E), which has a Hamming distance of 4 up to 114 kbits.

Subcategories of multispectral remote sensing include hyperspectral, in which hundreds of bands are collected and analyzed, and ultraspectral remote sensing where many hundreds of bands are used (Logicon, 1997). The main purpose of multispectral imaging is the potential to classify the image using multispectral classification. This is a much faster method of image analysis than is possible by human interpretation. == Multispectral remote sensing systems == {{Main|Remote sensing}} Remote sensing systems gather data via instruments typically carried on satellites in orbit around the Earth. The remote sensing scanner detects the energy that radiates from the object or area of interest. This energy is recorded as an analog electrical signal and converted into a digital value though an A-to-D conversion. There are several multispectral remote sensing systems that can be categorized in the following way: === Multispectral
