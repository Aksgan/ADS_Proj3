This can mean that the works ''may'' be problematic when searching for older grammatical usage. Finally, the collected works can be weighted heavily towards certain authors (such as [[Charles Dickens]]), while others are barely represented.<ref>{{Cite book| first = Sebastian | last = Hoffmann | year = 2005 | title = Grammaticalization And English Complex Prepositions: A Corpus-based Study | edition = 1st | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0415360498 | oclc = 156424479 }}</ref> How Project Gutenberg recognizes volunteers' efforts in making classic literary works available to the public has also engendered criticism. Those who do the time-consuming work of producing and donating the initial etext files are typically credited within the introduction. But they may feel that others who later process their donated files are being unrealistically credited as "co-producers." Transforming the utilitarian plain text files that have been the Project Gutenberg staple into an HTML format, for instance, typically requires only a very small fraction of the effort needed to produce the original text file. In March 2004, a new initiative was begun by Michael Hart and John S. Guagliardo<ref>Executive director of the World eBook Library.</ref> to provide low-cost intellectual properties. The initial name for this project was ''Project Gutenberg 2'' (PG II), which created controversy among PG volunteers because of the re-use of the project's trademarked name for a commercial venture.<ref name="it21">{{Cite journal| last = Hane | first = Paula | title = Project Gutenberg Progresses | journal = Information Today | year = 2004 | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | url = http://www.infotoday.com/it/may04/hane1.shtml | accessdate = 20 August 2007 }}</ref> == Affiliated projects == All affiliated projects are independent organizations which share the same ideals, and have been given permission to use the ''Project Gutenberg'' trademark.
