the work of art." This paper is reprinted in other places as well, notably William Elton’s famous collection ''Aesthetics and Language'', which put aestheticians on notice that the analytics had shown up to clean house. "The Task of Defining a Work of Art" has been anthologized at least three times. It is the most sophisticated of the "you can’t define art" papers in the apply-Wittgenstein/ordinary language analysis years. "Reasons in Art Criticism" was in the two best aesthetics anthologies of the 60s, the ones edited by Kennick and by Margolis. It was also in the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company|Bobbs-Merrill]] Reprint Series in Philosophy, which was a selection of the most talked about articles in the 50s and 60s. [[George Dickie]] devoted a chapter of his book ''Evaluating Art'' to Ziff’s view about reasons why a work of art is good, and, 30 years after it was first published, he said it "remains one of the few truly stimulating pieces by present-day philosophers on the theory of art evaluation." Many students know Paul Ziff from the philosophy of mind papers in ''Philosophic Turnings''. "The Feelings of Robots", in which Ziff argued with his typical panache that robots could not have feelings, has attracted the most attention: viz., replies, reprintings, and inclusion on course reading lists. It went from ''Analysis'' in 1959, along with replies by [[J. J. C. Smart|Jack]] and [[Ninian Smart]], to [[Alan Ross Anderson]]’s volume ''Minds and Machines'' in 1964, which was part of [[Prentice Hall]]’s ''Contemporary Perspectives in Philosophy'' Series, and the first "can machines think" collection. People who have written on this topic, such as Keith Gunderson, invariably bring up Ziff’s short paper. It eventually showed up in introductory anthologies as well. "About Behaviorism", another ''Analysis'' paper, discusses two bad arguments against philosophical behaviorism in order to show the difference between, as [[Vere Claiborne Chappell | Vere Chappell]] put it, crude and refined behaviorism. Chappell included this paper in his anthology ''The Philosophy of Mind'', which came out in 1962 and was the first collection of readings on that area of philosophy. "The Simplicity of Other Minds" comes from ''The Journal of Philosophy''. It was originally an invited symposium paper at the [[American Philosophical Association]]’s Eastern Division meeting in 1965. The commentators were [[Sydney Shoemaker]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]]. Ziff went at the [[Problem of other minds|other minds problem]] by taking it as a question about picking the best explanatory hypothesis. According to [[Hilary Putnam]], Ziff was extending the "empirical realist reply to skepticism." In his 21-page paper about Ziff’s view, "Other Minds" (1972), Putnam discussed both Ziff’s argument and his commentators’ criticisms, and said that he and Ziff were in "essential agreement" on how to solve the other minds problem, and in "common disagreement with the modish treatment in terms of" criteria, analogies, and language learning. "Understanding Understanding" came out in 1972, Ziff’s second year at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]]. It has eight papers, all of them concerned with what had now become his main topic in the philosophy of language: viz., "how one understands what is said." He had, to some extent, written about this in his previous book, where three essays took up how to handle deviant, ungrammatical, and ambiguous utterances. Ziff was, before [[cognitive science]] came around the bend, virtually the only one working on how people really speak. Claims about truth conditions, reference, and speech acts were the center of attention back then. As I put it in my review in [[Metaphilosophy]], "lacking in both current linguistic theory and philosophy of language is any useful conception of how people talk". "Understanding Understanding" began to develop such a conception, factor by relevant factor. [[Zeno Vendler]] said that "in spite of Ziff’s own modest assessment of the results, it still represents the most interesting, and most important, recent work on the problem of understanding speech". Two essays are criticisms, taking on [[Paul Grice|Grice]]’s original attempt to connect what a sentence means and what a speaker intends, and then [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]’s concept of stimulus meaning. The former was first in ''Analysis'', the latter in ''The Philosophical Review''. [[A. J. Ayer]] thought the paper on Grice was one of the better critical pieces he had read in a number of years. The reviewer for ''Philosophia'' was discouraged "to find later elaborations of Grice’s theory (e.g., Schiffer’s) failing to respond to this essay originally published in 1967". Two essays are about how natural languages differ from formal languages, and how one should view talk about the logical structure of English sentences, which was in vogue then, in large part because of the hoopla about [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]an deep structures and a new interest (à la Davidson, Montague, and Parsons) in event sentences and indirect discourse. In "Understanding", Ziff presented an analytical data processing-systematic synthesis view of understanding what people say. The most important chapters - "What Is Said", "There’s More To Seeing Than Meets the Eye", and "Something About Conceptual Schemes" - are about, in their various ways, how levels of abstraction are involved in understanding what people say, as with Ziff’s famous example of someone saying that a cheetah can outrun a man. Ziff was the first philosopher to appreciate this phenomenon. ===Books=== '''''Semantic Analysis''''' came out in 1960, and by 1967 it had gone through five printings in hardbound and was also appearing in paperback. The book goes back to Ziff’s work in [[aesthetics]]. As far back as graduate school, he was thinking about the reasons why a work of art is either good or bad, and so he was interested in determining what the phrase 'good painting' means. From there, he went on to determine what the word 'good' means in English: viz., "answering to certain interests". And then all the way to "an informal introduction to and sketch of a rigorous semantic theory" that would be adequate for "determining a method and a means of evaluating and choosing between competing analyses of words and utterances". In short, for confirming claims that a
