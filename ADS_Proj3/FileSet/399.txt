[[Ty Warner|Ty Warner Inc.]], which was later renamed as [[Ty Inc.]] in late 1993. Each toy has an inner "posable lining" and is stuffed with plastic pellets (or "beans") rather than conventional stuffing (see [[polyvinylchloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene|PE]]), giving Beanie Babies a flexible feel. The original nine Beanie Babies launched in 1993 were Legs the Frog, Squealer the Pig, Spot the Dog, Flash the Dolphin, Splash the Whale, Chocolate the Moose, Patti the Platypus, Brownie the Bear (later renamed "Cubbie"), and Punchers the Lobster (later renamed "Pinchers").<ref>{{Cite news | title = Those Beanies are still hot, and there's no sign of the craze slowing down | author = Amy Carr | date = August 14, 1997 | publisher = [[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] | quote = Punchers the red lobster.

Ty, Inc. stopped producing the product in 1999; but consumer demand led them to reconsider. In 2000, a Beanie Baby named "The Beginning" was introduced to remind people of Beanie Babies' comeback. [[Teenie Beanies]], an offshoot of the Beanie Babies line, were made by additional manufacturers for a few [[McDonalds]] [[Happy Meal]] promotions. They are not new Beanie Babies, but Beanie Babies in a smaller size. ==Sociology of Beanie Babies== The phenomenon of Beanie Babies is an example of a product of [[popular culture]]. Based on the sales and revenue of this toy, Ty Warner Inc. created an empire worth over $6 billion. In 1995, there was fear that the public was losing interest in this hot commodity. In fact, demand was increasing significantly, resulting in a profit of $250 million in the following year, with substantial re-sale value in the secondary market. In 2008 Ty, Inc. released a follow-up line, [[Beanie Babies 2.0]], for use on online games on the Ty website. ===Marketing strategies=== Much of the success of Beanie Babies can be attributed to the marketing strategies of the company.<ref>Becker, H. S. (1982). Art Worlds and Collective Activity. Art Worlds. 1-39.</ref> The ten strategies employed by Ty Warner included: # Reasonable Price: [[Ty Warner]] wanted to keep Beanie Babies selling at a reasonable price, but did not want to mass produce them. In doing so, he followed steps 4 and 5 by limiting production and distribution by only selling to smaller retailers. # Keep it Secretive: [[Ty Warner]] was able to keep people interested because they weren’t jaded by the constant advertisements that most large toy companies use; when people don’t know what to expect, it becomes more appealing. # Surprise People: Unpredictability became entertaining to the mass public and made people even more eager to engage in the collection process of Beanie Babies. # Limit Production: Limiting production ensured that keeping some Beanie Babies rare would keep people excited. # Avoid Large Chain Retailers: Unlike most toys that are mass produced and retailed to major toy stores, Beanie Babies were sold at smaller, more refined specialty shops. This helped sustain the authentic image of Beanie Babies. # Simplicity: Because only a few different colors of fabric were used for each Beanie Baby, costs were kept low. At the same time, this simplicity appealed to everyone because what they saw is what they got. # Personification: Personification made Beanie Babies easier to relate to; every Beanie Baby had a Ty tag with a unique name, birthday, and poem. This only increased the excitement of the buyers because it was no longer just a [[stuffed animal]]. # Variety: Producing a variety of Beanie Babies attracted everyone because this tactic aims to please everyone’s taste. This ploy also made serious collectors more eager to collect every Beanie Baby out there. # Retirements: Retirement created frenzy among Beanie Baby consumers. When Ty would retire a certain Beanie Baby, demand would increase, while supply came to a halt. # Risk: Every previous strategy that Warner developed was a risk, and he succeeded in going against the norm.<ref>Ty Warner's Marketing Strategy.

In recent years, the popularity of Beanie Babies has continued to fade. Some of the more common styles can be found fairly cheaply. New Beanie Baby designs continue to be released, and increasingly include bears and limited edition items. On December 27, 2007, Ty made a massive retirement of its Beanie Baby line, retiring over 240 styles of Beanie Babies, leaving only licensed characters, key-clip versions of popular Beanie Baby styles, popular store exclusives and country exclusives as current. On January 2, 2008, Ty introduced a "replacement" line called [[Beanie Babies 2.0]], the next generation of the beanbag toys.
