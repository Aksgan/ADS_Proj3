SHA stands for '''Secure Hash Algorithm'''. SHA-2 includes a significant number of changes from its predecessor, [[SHA-1]]. SHA-2 consists of a set of four hash functions with digests that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits. In 2005, security flaws were identified in SHA-1, namely that a mathematical weakness might exist, indicating that a stronger hash function would be desirable.<ref>[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html Schneier on Security: Cryptanalysis of SHA-1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Although SHA-2 bears some similarity to the SHA-1 algorithm, these attacks have not been successfully extended to SHA-2. A new hash standard, SHA-3, is currently under development &mdash; an ongoing [[NIST hash function competition]] is scheduled to end with the selection of a winning function in 2012. The SHA-3 algorithm will not be derived from SHA-2. ==Hash function== [[File:SHA-2.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|One iteration in a SHA-2 family compression function.

The algorithms are collectively known as SHA-2. The algorithms were first published in 2001 in the draft FIPS PUB 180-2, at which time review and comments were accepted. FIPS PUB 180-2, which also includes SHA-1, was released as an official standard in 2002. In February 2004, a change notice was published for FIPS PUB 180-2, specifying an additional variant, SHA-224, defined to match the key length of two-key [[Triple DES]]. These variants are patented in {{cite patent|US|6829355}}. The [[United States]] has released the patent under a royalty free license.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Licensing Declaration for US patent 6829355.|url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/858/|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32- and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are simply truncated versions of the first two, computed with different initial values. The SHA-2 functions are not as widely used as SHA-1, despite their better security. Reasons might include lack of support for SHA-2 on systems running Windows XP SP2 or older,<ref>Microsoft Corporation, [http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/8/7/687484ed-8174-496d-8db9-f02b40c12982/Overview%20of%20Windows%20XP%20Service%20Pack%203.pdf Overview of Windows XP Service Pack 3]</ref> a lack of perceived urgency since SHA-1 collisions have not yet been found, or a desire to wait until [[NIST hash function competition|SHA-3]] is standardized.
