There are no known explanation for how one is supposed to calculate a, b or c out of these equations. ==One-point second-order iterative method: Simple rational approximation== Similarly, we can derive a variation of Halley's formula based on a one-point ''second-order'' iterative method to solve <math>\,f(x)=\alpha(\neq 0)</math> using simple rational approximation by :<math>h(z)=\frac{a}{z+b}.</math> Then we need to evaluate :<math>h^{(i)}(x)=f^{(i)}(x), \qquad i=0,1.</math> Thus we have :<math>x_{n+1}=x_{n}-\frac{f(x_n)-\alpha}{f'(x_n)} \left(\frac{f(x_n)}{\alpha}\right).</math> The algebraic interpretation of this iteration is obtained by solving :<math>g(x)=1-\frac{\alpha}{{f(x)}}=0.</math> This one-point second-order method is known to show a locally quadratic convergence if the root of equation is simple. SRA strictly implies this one-point second-order interpolation by a simple rational function. We can notice that even third order method is a variation of Newton's method. We see the Newton's steps are multiplied by some factors. These factors are called the ''convergence factors'' of the variations, which are useful for analyzing the rate of convergence.

It was stated that most real microprocessors have a complex instruction set and many subtleties to increase efficiency, that can be a distraction for students that are studying the essential and universal aspects of a [[microprocessor]] (that are common to different designs). Hence this hypothetical computer is used to explain all the basic concepts of microprocessor design even though it is impossible to cover every aspect. The architecture of the SIC uses 3 byte integers, 5 registers and can access 2<sup>15</sub>=32768 bytes of memory. ==The five registers== * '''A''' register (accumulator): This is the three-byte register that is used for arithmetic operations. * '''X''' register (index): The index register can operate in two modes, direct and indexed. * '''SW''' register (status word) * '''PC''' register (program counter)it contains the address of next instruction to be fetched for execution. * '''L''' register (linkage): This register is used for subroutine jumps. Negative values are stored in 2's complement format. The SIC has two versions; a standard version SIC, and an extended version SIC/XE. The extended version has floating point numbers. ==See also== * [[Computer]] * [[MIX]] * [[System software]] * [[Assembly language]] * [[Processor register]] * [[Virtual machine]] ==External links== * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sicvm/ SICvm] A Virtual Machine based on a Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC) [[Category:Educational abstract machines]] {{Compsci-stub}} [[zh:簡化指令計算機]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34500</id> <title>Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization</title> <text>{{Context|date=June 2009}} The '''Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization''' ('''SISO''') is an organization dedicated to the promotion of [[modeling and simulation]] (M&S) [[interoperability]] and reuse for the benefit of diverse M&S communities, including [[software developer|developers]], [[procurement|procurers]], and users, world-wide.<ref>[http://www.sisostds.org/index.php?tg=fileman&idx=get&id=5&gr=Y&path=SISO+Products%2FSISO+Administrative+Products&file=SISO+Vision+document+06112007.doc "SISO Vision Document", SISO, 11 June 2007]</ref> ==History== The '''Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization''' ('''SISO''') originated with a small [[conference]] held April 26 and 27, 1989, called, "Interactive Networked Simulation for Training". The original conference attracted approximately 60 people. The group was concerned that there was activity occurring in networked simulation, but that it was occurring in isolation. The group believed that if there were a means to exchange information between companies and groups that the technology would advance more rapidly. The group also believed that once the technology begins to stabilize then there would also be a need for [[standardization]]. The technology and the consensus of the community would be captured in the standards as networking or simulation technology matured.<ref>[http://www.sisostds.org/index.php?tg=articles&idx=More&article=1&topics=1 "About SISO", SISO, 13 May 2009]</ref> The pre-history of SISO starts with [[SIMNET]], a [[DARPA]] program from 1983 through 1991 that demonstrated the feasibility of networking substantial numbers of (relatively) low-cost simulators on a "virtual battlefield." Based on the success of this program, the US Army initiated a large-scale program called Combined Arms Tactical Training. In order to ensure that multiple teams of contractors would be able to bid on various components of this program, the Army Program Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), soon to be renamed as the Army Simulation Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM - now PEO STRI), in conjunction with [[DARPA]] and the newly established [[Defense Modeling and Simulation Office]] ([[Defense Modeling and Simulation Office|DMSO]] now [[Modeling and Simulation Coordination Office]] (MSCO)), initiated a series of workshops at which user agencies and interested contractors could work together to develop standards based on the SIMNET protocols. The "First Conference on Standards for the Interoperability of Defense Simulations" was held on 22–23 August 1989 in Orlando, Florida. DIS Workshops were held semi-annually from 1989 through 1996. The first Simulation Interoperability Workshop (SIW) held under the SISO banner was the 1997 Spring SIW in Orlando. SIWs have continued semi-annually since 1997. In 2001, SISO also began holding annual Euro-SIWs at various locations in Europe. In 2003, the [[IEEE Computer Society]] Standards Activities Board (SAB) granted the SISO Standards Activities Committee (SAC) status as a recognized [[IEEE]] Sponsor Committee. SISO is recognized as a Standards Development Organization (SDO) by [[NATO]] and as a Standards Sponsor by IEEE. In addition, SISO is a Category C Liaison Organization with [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]] for the development of standards for the representation and interchange of data regarding Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specification ([[SEDRIS]]).<ref>[http://www.sisostds.org/index.php?tg=fileman&idx=get&id=5&gr=Y&path=SISO+Policy&file=SISOoverview2009.pdf Miller, Duncan C.,"A Brief Overview of SISO", SISO, 2009]</ref> SISO was an original sponsor of [[SimSummit]].<ref>>[http://www.sim-summit.org/Sim_Summit/Organization.htm Waite, W. et al "Context and Protocol for the SimSummit Forum"]</ref> ==Contributions== SISO originated,
