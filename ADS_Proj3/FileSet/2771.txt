Every application can be made to open on any screen and adapts itself to its environment.<ref>Stuntzi, S: MUI User Documentation. 1997</ref> MUI was released as [[shareware]]. Starting from MUI 4.0 it is distributed for free but shareware key is still required to activate all user configuration options in MUI 3. ==Application theory== UI development is done in source code level without aid of GUI builders. In MUI application the programmer only defines logical structure of the GUI and the layout is determined on run time depending on user configuration. Unlike on other GUI toolkits developer does not determine exact coordinates for UI objects but only their relative placement to each others using object groups. In traditional [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] based UI coding programmer had to calculate placement of gadgets relative to font and border sizes. By default all UI elements are resizable and change their size to match window size. It can also automatically switch into smaller font or hide UI elements if there is not enough space on screen to display window with full contents. This makes it very easy to build UI which adapts well to tiny and large displays as well. <ref>http://www.sasg.com/mui/concepts.html</ref> <ref>http://amigaworld.net/modules/faq/index.php?cat_id=2#15</ref> <ref>Stuntzi, S: MUI Programmer Documentation. 1997</ref> There are over 50 built-in MUI classes today and various 3rd party MUI classes. ====Example==== <source lang="c"> // Complete MUI application #include <libraries/mui.h> #include <proto/muimaster.h> // Sample application: ApplicationObject, SubWindow, WindowObject, WindowContents, VGroup, Child, TextObject, MUIA_Text_Contents, "Hello World!", End, End, End, End; </source> This example code creates small MUI application with the text "Hello World!" displayed on it. It is also possible embed other [[BOOPSI]] based GUI toolkit objects inside MUI application. ==Applications== Some notable applications that use MUI as a widget toolkit include: * [[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]] - desktop environment * [[Origyn Web Browser]] - web browser * [[PageStream]] - desktop publishing * [[YAM (Yet Another Mailer)|YAM]] - email client ==Other GUI toolkits== Actually there are two main widget toolkits in the Amiga world, and are competing each other. The most widely used is MUI (adopted into [[AROS]], [[MorphOS]] and in most Amiga programs), the other one is [[ReAction GUI|ReAction]] which was adopted in AmigaOS 3.5. There is in development a [[GTK MUI]] wrapper and it will allow the porting of various [[GTK]] based software.<ref>http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-mui/</ref> There is also modern interfaces based on XML, [http://www.feelin.fr Feelin]. ==Palette extension to Workbench defaults== MUI extended [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]]'s four-colour [[Palette (computing)|palette]] with four additional colours, allowing smoother [[Image gradient|gradient]]s with less noticeable [[dither]]ing. The MagicWB companion to MUI made use of this extended palette to provide more attractive icons to replace the dated Workbench defaults. MUI 4 added support for [[alpha blending]] and support for user defined widget shapes. {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" ! !! colspan="8" | MUI eight-colour palette |- !

It can be shown that if a magic hypercube consists of the numbers 1, 2, ..., ''n''<sup>''k''</sup>, then it has magic number :<math>M_k(n) = \frac{n(n^k+1)}{2}</math> If, in addition, the numbers on every [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] diagonal also sum up to the hypercube's magic number, the hypercube is called a [[perfect magic hypercube]]; otherwise, it is called a [[semiperfect magic hypercube]]. The number ''n'' is called the order of the magic hypercube. Five-, six-, seven- and eight-dimensional magic hypercubes of order three have been constructed by [[J. R. Hendricks]]. Marian Trenkler proved the following theorem: A ''p''-dimensional magic hypercube of order ''n'' exists if and only if ''p'' > 1 and ''n'' is different from 2 or ''p'' = 1. A construction of a magic hypercube follows from the proof. The [[R (programming language)|R programming language]] includes a module, <tt> library(magic)</tt>, that will create magic hypercubes of any dimension (with ''n'' a multiple of 4). Change to more modern conventions here-after (basically k ==> n and n ==> m) ==Conventions== It is customary to denote the [[dimension]] with the letter 'n' and the [[cardinality|order]] of a hypercube with the letter 'm'. *'''(''n'') Dimension''' : the number of directions within a hypercube. *'''(''m'') Order''' : the number of numbers along a direction. Further: In this article the analytical number range [0..m<sup>n</sup>-1] is being used. For the regular number range [1..m<sup>n</sup>] you can add 1 to each number. This has absolutely no effect on the properties of the hypercube. ==Notations== in order to keep things in hand a special notation was developed: *'''[ <sub>k</sub>i; k=[0..n-1]; i=[0..m-1] ]''': positions within the hypercube *'''< <sub>k</sub>i; k=[0..n-1]; i=[0..m-1] >''': vector through the hypercube Note: The notation for position can also be used for the value on that position. There where it is appropriate dimension and order can be added to it thus forming: <sup>n</sup>[<sub>k</sub>i]<sub>m</sub> As is indicated 'k' runs through the dimensions, while the coordinate
