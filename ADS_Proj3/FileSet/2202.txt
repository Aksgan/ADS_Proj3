often refereed by [[peer review]]ers drawn from established [[Academic discipline|disciplines]]; not surprisingly, interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research. In addition, untenured researchers know that, when they seek [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] and [[tenure]], it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity. They may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure. Interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy. For example, interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a [[joint appointment]], with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program (such as [[women's studies]]) and a traditional discipline (such as [[history]]). If the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions, new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work. Other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals, leading to the perception, if not the fact, that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish. In addition, since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines, it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teacher's salary and time. During periods of budgetary retraction, the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency (i.e., students majoring in the traditional discipline) makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood. For these same reasons, the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often perceived as a competition for diminishing funds, and may for this reason meet resistance. Due to these and other barriers, interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves. If they succeed, they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions. In so doing, they lower the risk of entry. Examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines include [[neuroscience]], [[cybernetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biomedical engineering]]. These new fields are occasionally referred to as "interdisciplines." ==Interdisciplinary studies== "Interdisciplinary studies" is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s, knowledge, skills, interconnections, and [[epistemology]] in an educational setting. Interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence, but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective (for example, women's studies or [[medievalism|medieval studies]]). More rarely, and at a more advanced level, interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study, in a critique of institutionalized disciplines' ways of segmenting knowledge. Perhaps the most common complaint regarding interdisciplinary programs, by supporters and detractors alike, is the lack of synthesisâ€”that is, students are provided with multiple disciplinary perspectives, but are not given effective guidance in resolving the conflicts and achieving a coherent view of the subject. Critics of interdisciplinary programs feel that the ambition is simply unrealistic, given the knowledge and intellectual maturity of all but the exceptional undergraduate; some defenders concede the difficulty, but insist that cultivating interdisciplinarity as a habit of mind, even at that level, is both possible and essential to the education of informed and engaged citizens and leaders capable of analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information from multiple sources in order to render reasoned decisions. '''The Politics of Interdisciplinary Studies''' Since 1998 there has been an ascendancy in the value of the concept and practice of interdisciplinary research and teaching and a growth in the number of bachelors degrees awarded at U.S. universities classified as multi- or interdisciplinary studies. The number of interdisciplinary bachelors degrees awarded annually rose from 7,000 in 1973 to 30,000 a year by 2005 according to data from the National Center of Educational Statistics (NECS). In addition, educational leaders from the Boyer Commission to Carnegie's President Vartan Gregorian to Alan Leshner, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st Century. This has been echoed by federal funding agencies, particularly the NIH under the Direction of [[Elias Zerhouni]], who have advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher, single discipline ones. At the same time, longstanding bachelors in interdisciplinary studies programs many existing and thriving for 30 or more years, have been closed down, in spite of healthy enrollment. Examples include Arizona International (formerly part of the [[University of Arizona]]), The School of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Miami University]], and the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Wayne State University]]; others such as the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Appalachian State University]], and [[George Mason University]]'s New Century College, have been cut back. Stuart Henry has seen this trend as part of the hegemony of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry. This is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia. ==Historical examples== There are many examples of when a particular idea, almost on the same period, arises in different disciplines. One case is the shift from the approach of focusing on "specialized segments of attention" (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of "instant sensory awareness of the whole", an attention to the "total field", a "sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity", an "integral idea of structure and configuration". This has happened in painting (with [[cubism]]), physics, poetry, communication and [[educational theory]]. According to [[Marshall McLuhan]], this [[paradigm shift]] was due to the passage from an era shaped by [[mechanization]], which brought sequentiality, to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.<ref>[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 [http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html]</ref> ==See also== See [[:Category:Interdisciplinary fields]] * [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)]] * [[Crossdisciplinarity]] * [[Disciplinary]] * [[Holism in science]] * [[Integrative learning]] * [[Interprofessional education]] * [[Multidisciplinarity]] * [[Social ecological model|Social Ecological Model]] * [[Systems thinking]] * [[Systems theory]] * Periodic Table of Human Sciences in [[Tinbergen's four questions]] * [[Transdisciplinarity]] * [[Transdisciplinary Studies]] * [[Science of Team Science]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * Alderman, Harold, Chiappori, Pierre Andre, Haddad, Lawrence, Hoddinott, John, Unitary Versus Collective Models of
