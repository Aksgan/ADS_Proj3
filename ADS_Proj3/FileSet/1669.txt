the aforementioned phases of the life of the enterprise-integration project can be mapped. It also will permit the tools used by the investigators or practitioners at each phase to be indicated. The architecture defined will apply to projects, products, and processes; as well as to enterprises.<ref name="Nell96"/> == History == Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) is developed in the 1990s by an [[International Federation of Automatic Control|IFAC]]/[[International Federation of Information Processing|IFIP]] Task Force on [[Enterprise Architecture|Architectures]] for [[Enterprise Integration]] with [[Peter Bernus]], [[James G. Nell]] and others. The IFAC/IFIP Task Force on Architectures for Enterprise Integration was establishment in 1990 and had studied enterprise-reference architectures ever since.<ref name="Nell96"> [[J.G. Nell]] (2006). "[http://www.mel.nist.gov/sc5wg1/np_geram.htm Requirements and Methodology for Enterprise-Reference Architectures: A New Work Item Proposal]". updated 20 May 1996.</ref> In its work the Task Force has established the requirements to be satisfied by candidate enterprise-reference architectures and their associated methodologies to fulfill the needs of [[industry]] for such aids to [[enterprise integration]]. The result has been called GERAM, for "Generalized Enterprise-Reference Architecture and Methodology", by the Task Force. The Task Force has shown that such an architecture is feasible and that several architectures presently available in the literature can already or potentially can fulfil such requirements.<ref name="Nell96"/> The devopment of enterprise-reference architecture has evolved from the developemt of Design Methodology for Advanced Manufacturing Systems in the 1980s,<ref>Doumeingts, G., Vallespir, B., Darracar, D., M., "Design Methodology for Advanced Manufacturing Systems", Computers in Industry, Vol. 9, pp. 271-296, December 1987.</ref> such as [[CIMOSA]], the Open System Architecture for CIM.<ref>[[AMICE Consortium]] (1989).

These concepts include enterprise systems life cycle; business process modelling; modelling languages for different users of the architecture (business users, system designers, IT modelling specialists, others); integrated model representation in different model views. * ''Generic Enterprise Engineering Methodologies (GEEM)'' : Describe the generic processes of enterprise integration. These methodologies may be described in terms of process models with detailed instruction for each step of the integration process. * ''Generic Enterprise Modelling Languages (GEML)'' : Define the generic constructs (building blocks) for enterprise modelling adapted to the different needs of people creating and using enterprise models. * ''Generic Enterprise Modelling Tools (GEMT)'' : Define the generic implementation of enterprise-integration methodologies and modelling languages and other support for creation and use of enterprise models. * ''Enterprise Models (EM)'' : Represents the enterprise operation. These models will be represented using generic modelling language constructs. * ''Ontological Theories (OT)'' : Formalise the most generic aspects of enterprise-related concepts in terms of essential properties and axioms. * ''Generic Enterprise Models (GEMs)'' : Identify reference models (partial models) which capture concepts common to many enterprises. GEMs will be used in enterprise modelling to increase modelling process efficiency. * ''Generic Modules (GMs)'' : Identify generally applicable products to be employed in enterprise integration (e.g. tools, integrating infrastructures, others.). === Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture === ''Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture'' (GERA) defines the enterprise related generic concepts recommended for use in enterprise integration projects. These concepts include [[enterprise Life Cycle|life cycle]]; enterprise [[entity type]]s, [[enterprise modelling]] with [[business process modelling]]; integrated model representation in different [[view model|model view]]s and [[modelling languages]] for different users of the [[enterprise architecture]] (business users, system designers, IT modelling specialists, among others).<ref name="Nell97"/> [[File:GERA Life-Cycle Concept.jpg|thumb|180px|Fig 2. GERA Life-Cycle Concept.]] ==== Life-Cycle Concept ==== Provides for the identification of the life-cycle phases for any enterprise entity from entity conception to its final end. The Figure 2: GERA Life-Cycle Concept, shows the GERA life cycle phases of enterprise entities. A total of 9 life cycle phases has been defined. * Identification phase allows the identification of the enterprise business or any part of it in terms of its relation to both its internal and external environment. This includes the definition general commitments of the integration or engineering activities to be carried out in relevant projects. * Concept phase provides for the presentation of the management visions, missions, values, operational concepts (build/buy, etc.), policies, plus others. * Requirement phase allows the description of operational processes and collection of all their functional, behavioural, informational and capability requirements. * Design phase is the specification of operational system with all its components satisfying the above requirements. Process and resources alternatives may be specified which provide operational alternatives to be used during the operation. * Implementation phase describes the real operational system which may deviate from the designed system due to enterprise preferences or availability of components. * Build phase supports the system manifestation, physical implementation of resources, testing and validation for the designed processes and the subsequent release for operation. * Operation phase employs the released operational processes and the provided resources to support the life cycle phases of the enterprise products. * System Change/Re-Engineering phase allows to modify or re-engineer the operational processes according to newly identified needs or capabilities provided by new technologies. * End of Life phase supports the recycling or disposal of the operational system at the ending of its use in the enterprise operation. This phase has to provide concepts for recycling and/or disposal of all or part of the system. [[File:GERA Enterprise-Entity Concept.jpg|thumb|360px|left|Fig 3. GERA Enterprise-Entity Concept.]] ==== Enterprise Entity Type Concept ==== Identifies entity types to be used in enterprise engineering and enterprise integration. Adopting a recursive view of integration altogether five entity types with their associated life-cycles can be identified. The recursiveness of the first four entity types can be demonstrated by identifying the role of the different entities,
