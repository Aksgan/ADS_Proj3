ARX was a pre-emptive [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]], multi-user operating system. Much of the OS ran in [[user mode]] and as a result suffered performance problems due to switches into [[kernel mode]] to perform [[mutex]]es, which led to the introduction of the SWP instruction to the instruction set of the ARM3 version of the ARM processor. It had support of optical ([[Write Once Read Many|WORM)]] disks file system <ref name=AppManagRCAc /> and featured a window system, a window toolkit (and a direct manipulation [[User Interface]] editor<ref name=BTLTSARC>{{Cite web | title = Brian T. Lewis - Resume | accessdate = 2010-12-26 | url = http://pages.sbcglobal.net/btlewis/resume-formatted.html }}</ref>) and an InterScript-based text editor. The OS had to be fitted in a 512KB [[ROM image]] <ref name=FAMLA500>{{Cite web | title = Full Acorn Machine List | accessdate = 2010-12-27 | url = http://www.khantazi.org/Archives/MachineLst.html#A500 }}</ref>. This suggests that ARX had a [[microkernel]]-type design. It was not finished in time to be fitted to the Acorn Archimedes range of computers, which shipped in 1987 with the [[Arthur (operating system)|Arthur]] operating system, derived from the earlier [[Acorn MOS|MOS]] operating system from Acorn's earlier [[8-bit]] [[BBC Micro]] range. Arthur was later superseded by [[RISC OS]]. The Acorn Research Centre was bought out by [[Olivetti]].

It is most famous for previously being used in [[KDE]] (series [[KDE 2|2]] and [[KDE 3|3]]) to simulate an [[analog synthesizer]]. A key component of aRts is the [[sound server]] which mixes several [[streaming media|sound stream]]s in [[Real-time computing|realtime]]. The [[sound server]], called '''artsd''' (d for [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]), is also utilized as the standard sound server for KDE2–3. However, the sound server is not dependent on KDE and can be used in other projects. It is a direct competitor to [[JACK Audio Connection Kit]], another real-time sound server, and an indirect competitor to the [[Enlightened Sound Daemon]] (ESD). It is now common to use [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]]'s software mixing instead of artsd. The '''aRts''' [[Platform (computing)|platform]] also includes aRts Builder — an [[application software|application]] for building custom layouts and configurations for audio mixers, sequencers, synthesizers and other audio [[schema]]{{dn}} via a user-friendly [[graphical user interface]]. aRts is [[free software]], distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. == End of project == On December 2, 2004 aRts' creator and primary developer Stefan Westerfeld announced he was leaving the project due to a variety of fundamental development and technical issues with aRts. In KDE 4 developers chose to replace aRts with a new multimedia API known as [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]]<ref>[http://dot.kde.org/2006/04/27/phonon-multimedia-kde-4 “Phonon: Multimedia in KDE 4”], ''dot.kde.org'', 27 April 2006.</ref>.
