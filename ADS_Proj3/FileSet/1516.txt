The list of hypothesized flaws is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system. ==See also== * [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Flaw Hypothesis Methodology}} [[Category:Methodology]] [[Category:Computer security]] {{Soft-eng-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>13762</id> <title>Fleet Radio Unit</title> <text>'''Fleet Radio Units''' (FRU) were the major centers for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cryptological and [[signals intelligence]] during the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Initially two FRUs were established in the Pacific, one at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]], called [[Station HYPO]] or FRUPAC (Fleet Radio Unit, Pacific), and the other, called [[Station CAST]] or Belconnen, at [[U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point|Cavite Naval Yard]], then [[Corregidor]], Philippines. With the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|fall of the Philippines]] to [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces in April and May 1942, CAST personnel were evacuated to a newly established FRU at [[Melbourne, Australia]], called [[FRUMEL]] (Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne). HYPO and FRUMEL supervised detached field units scattered at various locations and aboard ships throughout the south, central, and north Pacific areas until the end of World War II. A third center, NEGAT, was based at [[OP-20-G]] headquarters in [[Washington DC]]. The entire cryptanalysis effort conducted by the units was called ''[[Operation Magic]]''. Liaison between the units and with the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB; the British signals intelligence center at [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]] in 1942) was titled ''[[Copek]]''. ==References== *{{cite book | last = Holmes | first = W.

Instead of sitting between the physical devices and the overlaying [[file systems]], FlexRAID sits on top of any existing file-system. Initially, FlexRAID wanted to function in a similar fashion to [[RAID-Z#RAID-Z|RAID-Z]]. The intent was to build FlexRAID using the [[ZFS]] for Linux port project.<ref>[http://zfs-fuse.net ZFS-fuse.net]</ref> However, it made more sense to strive at embracing any existing file-system than writing another proprietary one. This also allowed for FlexRAID to be supported on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform in addition to [[Linux]]. FlexRAID does not mandate its own file-system; instead, it allows users to use any file-system, which it builds its own lightweight file-system on top of. RAID-Z combines both the file management aspect with the RAID system. FlexRAID takes a different approach as it leaves the file management aspect to the underlying file-system but keeps a copy of relevant file-system information. In its current released implementation, FlexRAID is a [[Snapshot (computer storage)|snapshot]] RAID. A real-time version of FlexRAID is in the works and is anticipated to be released soon. Even more interesting, FlexRAID was originally designed to only work in real-time mode. However, difficulties
