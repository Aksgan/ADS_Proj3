that the quantum cross section exceeds the classical cross section by a factor of two, even for '''large''' scatterers. This "shadow scattering" is noticeable, for example, in the elastic and near-elastic scattering of intermediate energy alpha particles by nuclei.

This program is available to both undergraduates (as a [[minor]], [[Academic major|major]] or second major) as well as graduate students (as a [[PhD]] track within [[philosophy]]). ==Undergraduate Program== Within the PNP program undergraduates students are able to choose between Cognitive Neuroscience (CN) track, examining "the study of higher brain functioning with behavioral research directed at understanding activities such as perceiving, attending, remembering, and acting" or the Language, Cognition and Culture (LCC) track, looking at "the importance of language in human cognition, and the integration of cognition with one's cultural environment" <ref name="PNP Undergraduate Program">[http://pnp.artsci.wustl.edu/undergraduate], PNP Undergraduate Program Details.</ref>. ==Graduate Program== The PNP graduate program is a track within the [[PhD]] of philosophy and is not designed to be a program in cognitive sciences as the undergraduate program may be used as.

For each phosphosite, PHOSIDA lists matching [[kinase]] motifs, predicted secondary structures, conservation patterns, and its dynamic regulation upon stimulus or other treatments such as kinase inhibition, for example. It includes [[phosphoproteome]]s of various organisms ranging from [[eukaryote]]s such as human and [[yeast]] to [[bacteria]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Lactococcus lactis]]''. Even the [[phosphoproteome]] of an archaean organism, namely ''[[Halobacterium salinarium]]'', is available. The integration of phosphoproteomes identified in organisms, which cover the phylogenetic tree representatively, enables to examine phosphorylation events from a global point of view including conservation and evolutionary preservation in time. Moreover, PHOSIDA also predicts phosphosites on the basis of [[support vector machine]]s. ==External links== *[http://www.phosida.com Official website] [[Category:Phosphorus]] [[Category:Chemical databases]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29143</id> <title>Photochemical logic gate</title> <text>{{onesource|date=August 2009}} A '''photochemical logic gate''' is based
