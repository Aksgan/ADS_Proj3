It was first used by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US in 1960 in order to use simulated [[evolution]] as a learning process aiming to generate [[artificial intelligence]]. Fogel used [[finite state machine]]s as predictors and evolved them. Currently evolutionary programming is a wide [[evolutionary computing]] dialect with no fixed structure or ([[Genetic representation|representation]]), in contrast with some of the other dialects. It is becoming harder to distinguish from [[Evolution strategy|evolutionary strategies]]. Some of its original variants are quite similar to the later [[genetic programming]], except that the program structure is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve. Its main variation operator is [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]]; members of the population are viewed as part of a specific species rather than members of the same species therefore each parent generates an offspring, using a (μ + μ) [[Selection (genetic algorithm)|survivor selection]]. ==See also== * [[Artificial intelligence]] * [[Genetic algorithm]] * [[Genetic programming]] * [[Genetic operator]] ==References== * Fogel, L.J., Owens, A.J., Walsh, M.J.

A transition represents a subprocess; there are two kinds: ;processor: primitive, contains processing logic ;system: contains another Petri net A place represents state information: there are two kinds: ;channel: represents [[control flow]]: contain data items called ''tokens'' that processors can consume and produce ;store: represents collective data: processors can read, write and modify them The values of tokens and stores are [[strongly typed]]. Transitions contain processing logic, written in a functional language, that describes the relationships between the values of the tokens they consume and produce and the stores they access. ==ExSpecT tool features== The ExSpecT editor supports direct manipulation of diagrams to create the control flow structure, and forms-based specification of data types and values and processing logic. The ExSpecT simulator supports simulated execution of processes, both stepwise and completely automated (randomized). The state of the process is visualized in the diagram. The ''dashboard'' feature allows user interface elements to be associated with the system; during simulation these elements display the (structured) values passing the system at that point, or prompt the user to specify such values. In this way, fully functional prototypes of systems, including the user interface, can be developed directly from their specifications. ==ExSpecT implementations== ExSpecT was developed in the early 1990s by
