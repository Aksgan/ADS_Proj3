typically large, boxy, and surface-mounted on the wall. Those controls had anywhere from four to eight speeds, typically four or five. Newer versions of the choke-style control employ electronic equipment as their resistor; this is much smaller, so the switch is typically mounted in a standard in-wall gang box; these typically have four speeds. ** ''Solid State variable speed control.'' These controls, commonly used on industrial fans, give you the option to control more than one (up to 15) fans off of one switch. 2.5 to 6 amp controls typically mount in place of a typical wall switch, while 8 to 15 amp controls can be much larger and boxier. * Wireless remote control. In recent years, remote controls have become an affordable option for controlling ceiling fans. While some models do employ this as their sole form of operation, it is more common for a person to purchase an after-market kit and install it on an existing fan. The hand-held remote transmits radio frequency or [[infrared]] signals to a receiver unit installed in the fan, which interprets and acts on the signals. ==Types of ceiling fans== Many styles of ceiling fans have been developed over the years in response to several different factors such as growing energy-consumption consciousness and changes in decorating styles. The advent and evolution of electronic technology has also played a major role in ceiling fan development. Following is a list of major ceiling fan styles and their defining characteristics: [[Image:Hunter Original.jpg|thumb|right|A cast-iron ceiling fan made by Hunter, dating from the early 1980s. This model is called the "Original".]] * Cast-iron ceiling fans. Cast-iron ceiling fans account for almost all ceiling fans made from their invention in 1882 through the 1950s. A cast-iron housing encases a very heavy-duty oil-bath motor, usually of the [[Shaded-pole motor|shaded-pole]] variety. These fans must be oiled periodically, usually once or twice per year, since they use an oil-bath system for lubrication. Because these fans are so sturdily built, and due to their utter lack of electronic components, it is not uncommon to see cast-iron fans aged eighty years or more running strong and still in use today. ** The Hunter 'Original' (manufactured by the Hunter Fan Co., formerly a division of Robbins & Myers, Inc.) is an example of a cast-iron ceiling fan. It has enjoyed the longest production run of any fan in history, dating from 1906 to the present (it is still being manufactured as the "Classic Original", with several spin-off models). The Original employed a [[shaded-pole motor]] from its inception until the late 1980s, at which point it was changed to a [[Electric motors#Permanent split-capacitor motor|permanent split-capacitor]] motor. Though the fan's physical appearance remained unchanged, the motor was further downgraded in 2002 when production was shipped [[Asia|overseas]]; the motor, though still oil-lubricated, was switched to a "skeletal" design, as discussed below. [[Image:Fasco charleston flywheel.jpg|thumb|right|A close-up of the dropped flywheel on a FASCO ceiling fan.]] [[Image:Emerson Universal.jpg|thumb|left|The Emerson "Heat Fan", one of the first fans to use a stack motor.]] * Stack-motor ceiling fans. In the late 1970s, due to rising energy costs prompted by the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]], [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] invented a new style of electric motor designed specifically for ceiling fans, the "stack" motor. This powerful, energy-efficient motor aided in the comeback of ceiling fans in America, since it was far less expensive to operate than air conditioning. With this design (which consists of a basic [[stator]] and squirrel-cage [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]]), the fan's blades mount to a central hub, known as a [[flywheel]]. The flywheel can be made of either metal or reinforced rubber, and can be mounted either flush with the fan's motor housing (concealed) or prominently below the fan's motor housing (known as a "dropped flywheel"). Many manufacturers used and/or developed their own stack motors, including (but not limited to) Casablanca, Emerson, FASCO, Hunter, and [[NuTone]]. Some manufacturers trademarked their personal incarnation of this motor: for example, Emerson came out with the "K-55" and "K-63" motors, and Casablanca with the "XLP-2000". One of the earliest stack-motor fans was the Emerson "Heat Fan", aka the "Universal" or "Blender Fan", a utilitarian fan with a dropped flywheel and blades made of [[fiberglass]] or [[plastic]]. This fan was produced from 1976 through 1983 and, while targeted at commercial settings, also found great success in residential settings. Another stack-motor fan; one without the dropped flywheel; is the Casablanca "Delta" (3-speed model as compared to the "Zephyr" which is a variable-speed model) pictured at the beginning of this article. While this motor is not nearly as widely used as in the 1970s and 1980s, it can still be found in certain high-end Casablanca and Emerson fans. One disadvantage of this type of fan is that the flywheel, if it is made from rubber, will dry out and crack over time and eventually break; this is usually not dangerous, but it renders the fan inoperable until the flywheel is replaced. * Direct-drive ceiling fans employ a motor with a stationary inner core with a shell that revolves around it (commonly called a "spinner" or "pancake" motor); the blades attach to this shell. Direct-drive motors are the least expensive motors to produce, and on the whole are the most prone to failure and noise generation.<ref name="fanbook"/> While the very first motors of this type (first used in the 1960s) were relatively heavy-duty, the quality of these motors has dropped significantly in recent years. This type of motor has become the standard for today's fans; it has been (and is) used in all [[Home Depot|Hampton Bay]] and [[Lowe's|Harbor Breeze]] ceiling fans, and has become commonly used by all other brands. ** Spinner fans employ a direct-drive motor and do not have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). This accounts for most industrial-style fans (though such fans sometimes have more moderate-quality motors), and some inexpensive residential-style fans (particularly those made overseas). ** Spinner-motor fans, sometimes incorrectly referred to as "spinners", employ a direct-drive (spinner) motor and ''do'' have a stationary decorative cover
