requested by the MPAA in its waiver application, citing the request as being broad and undefined. According to the FCC waiver on SOC, the following limitations would be placed on the granted waiver. There would be an SOC Activation Window Limitation. SOC can only be used for 90 days from the first day it is implemented, or until the movie is available on any pre-recorded media ([[DVD]], [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]]), whichever comes first. That way, according to the FCC, owners of legacy HDTVs (those without HDMI connections or HDCP certification) will not lose access to any content that they previously had access too. The FCC's 90 day limitation window is an effort to limit the potential of the MPAA to circumvent the rule by not releasing content on pre-recorded media. For example, as the world moves toward [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]], physical media could become obsolete. In such a case, a movie may never be released on "pre-recorded" media. After 90 days, SOC would be banned from use. The Waiver will be reviewed in 2 years. The FCC will review the waiver in two years time and assess whether the use of SOC has had adverse effects on public interest. However, the FCC leaves it up to companies that use SOC to file a report. This report should contain a summary of all consumer complaints in regard to SOC, the average price charged for first run programming with SOC activated, the average price charged for video-on-demand without SOC activated, detailed box office results prior to and after offering the program on-demand with SOC activated, and whether SOC has been effective in combating piracy during its use. This is certainly not a requirement and is vague in details. However, should SOC be ineffective at combating piracy there may be little incentive in using it. In fact, it may be possible that the MPAA member studios could decide against the continued practice of releasing first run movies to the video-on-demand market. The approved output devices are HDMI, all digital outputs that [[CableLabs]] has approved for unidirectional digital cable products, or any MVPD-approved protected output for [[Internet Protocol Television]] (IPTV) or [[Satellite television|Satellite]] Broadcasters. The intent here is to discourage the development of proprietary output connections by either the MPAA or the MVPD that could hamper competition from third party devices by using standard and/or accepted means of copy protected output. [[Closed captioning|Closed Captioning]] and Video Description should be provided as this is already a requirement that video-on-demand services must be offered with closed captions. The FCC included a consumer protection limit with the promise to cancel the waiver should MVPD not implement SOC in a manner that is in accordance with the waiver requirements. The waiver is not just limited to the MPAA or the MVPDs. According to the waiver "any similarly situated provider of firstrun theatrical content (“similarly situated provider”) and its MVPD partners may take advantage of the instant waiver by filing an Election to Participate (“Election’) in this proceeding." ==References== <references /> ==External links== * http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-10-795A1.pdf [[Category:Digital rights management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33720</id> <title>Selective file dumper</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = Selective File Dumper | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | collapsible = | author = Nanni Bassetti and Denis Frati | developer = | released = | latest release version = 1.5 | latest release date = March 21, 2008 | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] ([[shell script]]) | operating system = [[Linux]] | platform = | size = | language = | status = | genre = [[Computer forensics]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]]<br />[[GNU Lesser General Public License]] | website = http://sfdumper.sourceforge.net/ }} {{Portal|Free software}} '''Selective File Dumper''' (SFDumper) is a [[Free software|free]] [[open source]] [[computer forensics]] tool, written by Nanni Bassetti and Denis Frati, for [[Linux]] systems. It is a [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] script which can retrieve all the files of a chosen type (e.g. .doc or .jpg), regardless if they are active, deleted or unallocated. It automatically runs [[Foremost]] for carving, and [[Sleuthkit]] for deleted files retrieval. It then eliminates duplicated files by comparing the [[SHA256]] [[hash]]es of the carved files and the active and deleted files. Thanks to carving, files simply renamed to a different extension will be identified. Also, it is possible to expand the Foremost configuration file inside the script to add new extensions. Finally, it is possible to do a [[Index term|keyword]] search on the extracted files. The script can work on an image file or directly from a device.

Rajchman]] and his group at the [[Radio Corporation of America]] under the direction of [[Vladimir Zworykin]], of television technology fame. The team was never able to produce a commercially viable form of Selectron before [[core memory]] became almost universal, and it remains practically unknown today. == Development == [[Image:SelectronTube4096bit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|4096-bit Selectron tube]] [[Image:Selectron tube p1270778.jpg|thumb|upright|left|256-bit Selectron tube]] Development of Selectron started in 1946 at the behest of [[John von Neumann]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]<ref>Metropolis N, Rajchman, JA (1980) Early Research on Computers at RCA ''A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century'' pp 465-469, ISBN 0124916503</ref>, who was in the midst of designing the [[IAS machine]] and was looking for a new form of high-speed memory. RCA responded with the Selectron with a capacity of 4096 bits, with a planned production of 200 by the end of the year. They found the device to be much more difficult to build than expected, and
