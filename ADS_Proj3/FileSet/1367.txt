The applied tools of the mathematics disciplines of [[Celestial mechanics]] or its subfield [[Orbital mechanics]] (both predict orbital paths and positions) about a [[center of gravity]] are used to generate an [[ephemeris]] (plural: ''ephemerides''; from the Greek word ''ephemeros'' = daily) which is a table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times, or a formula to calculate such given the proper time offset from the epoch. Such calculations generally result in an elliptical path on a plane defined by some point on the orbit, and the two focii of the [[ellipse]]. Viewing from another orbiting body, following its own trace and orbit, creates shifts in three dimensions in the spherical trigonometry used to calculate relative positions. Interestingly, these dynamics in three dimensions are also elliptical, which means the ephemeris need only specify one set of equations to be a useful predictive tool to predict future location of the object of interest. Over time, inexactitudes and other errors accumulate, creating more and greater errors of prediction, so ephemeris factors need recalculated from time to time, and that requires a new epoch to be defined. Different astronomers or groups of astronomers used to define epochs to suit themselves, but these days of speedy communications, the epochs are generally defined in an international agreement, so astronomers world wide can collaborate more effectively. It was inefficient and error prone for data observed by one group to need translation (mathematic transformation) so other groups could compare information. ===J2000.0=== The current standard epoch is called "[[Epoch (astronomy)#Julian years and J2000|J2000.0]]" (and is approximately noon January 1, 2000, Gregorian calendar, at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]], [[Greenwich]], in [[London]] [[England]]. This is equivalent to: # The [[Julian date]] 2451545.0 TT ([[Terrestrial Time]]).<ref>Seidelmann, P. K., Ed. (1992). ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac.''

''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac.'' Sausalito, CA: University Science Books. Glossary, s.v. Terrestrial Dynamical Time.</ref> or # January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC ([[Coordinated Universal Time]]). When dates or times are expressed as years with a decimal fraction from J2000, the years are of exactly 365.25 days, which is the average length of a year in the [[Julian calendar]]. == Computing == <!-- This section is linked from [[Microsoft Office Excel]] --> The time kept internally by a [[computer]] system is usually expressed as the number of time units that have elapsed since a specified epoch, which is nearly always specified as midnight [[Universal Time]] on some particular date. Software timekeeping systems vary widely in the granularity of their time units; some systems may use time units as large as a day, while others may use [[nanosecond]]s. For example, for an epoch date of midnight UTC on January 1, 1900, and a time unit of a second, the time of midnight UTC on January 2, 1900 is represented by the number 86400, the number of seconds in one day. When times prior to the epoch need to be represented, it is common to use the same system, but with negative numbers. These representations of time are mainly for internal use. If an end user interaction with dates and times is required, the software will nearly always convert this internal number into a date and time representation that is comprehensible to humans. === Notable epoch dates in computing === {{Refimprove|date=September 2008}} The following table lists epoch dates used by popular software and other computer-related systems. The time in these systems is stored as the quantity of a particular time unit (days, seconds, nanoseconds, etc) that has elapsed since a stated time (usually midnight UTC at the beginning of the given date). {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"; border="5" !
