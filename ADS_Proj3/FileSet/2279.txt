It is released under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] license by the JBoss Community. In essence jBPM takes graphical process descriptions as input. A process is composed of activities that are connected with transitions. Processes represent an execution flow. The graphical diagram of a process is used as the basis for the communication between non technical users and developers. Each execution of a process definition is called a process instance. jBPM manages the process instances. Some activities are automatic like sending an email or invoking an ejb. Some activities can be wait states. For example human tasks or waiting for an external client to invoke a service method. jBPM will manage and persist the state of the process executions during those wait state activities. jBPM is based on the Process Virtual Machine (PVM) which is the JBoss Community's foundation to support multiple process languages natively. The JBoss Community currently focusses on expanding process languages BPMN 2.0 and jPDL. The PVM foundation makes jBPM future proof. As the fragmented BPM landscape changes, jBPM can add new process languages easily. == See also == {{portal|Free Software}} * [[JBoss (disambiguation)]], other JBoss software * [[Teamwork (software)]], a process/project management web application that relies on the jBPM engine == References == * [http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-05-2006/jw-0522-jbpm.html Manage your business processes with JBoss jBPM] on [[JavaWorld]] * [http://jboss.org/jbpm/ jBPM homepage] * [http://www.jorambarrez.be/blog/category/jbpm/ Some examples of what you can do with jBPM] {{compu-prog-stub}} [[Category:Workflow technology]] [[Category:Red Hat]] [[Category:Java enterprise platform]] [[Category:Java libraries]] [[Category:Cross-platform software]] [[de:JBPM]] [[fr:JBoss jBPM]] [[pl:JBPM]] [[pt:JBPM]] [[ru:JBPM]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19504</id> <title>JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform | screenshot = [[File:JBoss by Red Hat.jpg]] | caption = | developer = [[Red Hat]] | latest release version = 5.0 | latest release date = July 12, 2010<ref>{{cite web|title=JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform|url=https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SOA#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Achangelog-panel|publisher=JBoss Community}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0.2 Release Notes|url=http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_SOA_Platform/5/html/5.0.2_Release_Notes/index.html|publisher=[[Red Hat]]|date=2010}}</ref><ref name="EclipseCon">{{cite web|title=Red Hat Extends SOA Platform Offering For Expanded Enterprise and Cloud Adoption|url=http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2010/soa-enhanced.html|location=Santa Clara, CA|publisher=EclipseCon|date=March 22, 2010}}</ref> | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | operating system = [[Cross-platform]] | programming language = [[Java (programming language)|Java]] | genre = [[Service-oriented architecture|Service Oriented Architecture]] (SOA), [[Enterprise service bus|Enterprise Service Bus]] (ESB) | license = [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] | website = http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/soa/ }} The '''JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform''' (or '''JBoss SOA Platform''') is [[free software]]/[[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Java EE]]-based [[Service-oriented architecture|Service Oriented Architecture]] (SOA) software.
