It operates on the principle that most objects are derived from other, more general objects, and only differ in a few small aspects; while usually maintaining a list of pointers internally to other objects which the object differs from. ==An Analogy== To think of differential inheritance, you think in terms of what is different. So for instance, when trying to describe to someone how [[Dumbo]] looks, you could tell them in terms of elephants: ''Think of an elephant. Now Dumbo is a lot shorter, has big ears, no tusks, a little pink bow and can fly.'' Using this method, you don't need to go on and on about what makes up an elephant, you only need to describe the differences; anything not explicitly different can be safely assumed to be the same. ==External links== * [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Differential_inheritance_in_JavaScript Differential inheritance in JavaScript] ([[Mozilla Developer Center]] article) [[Category:Object-oriented programming]] {{soft-eng-stub}} [[es:Herencia diferencial]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10285</id> <title>Differential variational inequality</title> <text>In mathematics, a '''differential variational inequality (DVI)''' is a [[dynamical system]] that incorporates [[ordinary differential equation]]s and [[variational inequality|variational inequalities]] or [[Complementarity theory|complementarity problems]]. DVIs are useful for representing models involving both dynamics and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] constraints. Examples of such problems include, for example, mechanical impact problems, [[electrical circuit]]s with ''ideal'' [[diode]]s, [[Coulomb friction]] problems for contacting bodies, and dynamic economic and related problems such as [[dynamic traffic network]]s and networks of queues (where the constraints can either be upper limits on queue length or that the queue length cannot become negative). DVIs are related to a number of other concepts including [[differential inclusion]]s, [[projected dynamical systems]], [[evolutionary inequalities]], and [[parabolic variational inequalities]]. Differential variational inequalities were first formally introduced by [[Pang]] and [[Stewart]], whose definition should not be confused with the differential variational inequality used in Aubin and Cellina (1984). Differential variational inequalities have the form to find <math>u(t)\in K</math> such that : <math>\langle v-u(t), F(t,x(t),u(t))\rangle\geq 0</math> for every <math>v\in K</math> and almost all ''t''; ''K'' a closed convex set, where : <math>\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t,x(t),u(t)),\quad x(t_0) = x_0.</math> Closely associated with DVIs are dynamic/differential complementarity problems: if ''K'' is a closed convex cone, then the variational inequality is equivalent to the '''complementarity problem''': : <math>K\ni u(t)\quad\perp\quad F(t,x(t),u(t))\in K^*. \, </math> ==Index== The concept of the ''index'' of a DVI is important and determines many questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions to a DVI. This concept is closely related to the concept of index for [[differential algebraic equation]]s (DAE's), which is the number of times the algebraic equations of a DAE must be differentiated in order to obtain a complete system of differential equations for all variables. For a DVI, the index is the number of differentiations of ''F''(''t'', ''x'', ''u'') = 0 needed in order to locally uniquely identify ''u'' as a function of ''t'' and ''x''. ==See also== * [[Variational inequality]] * [[Projected dynamical systems]] * [[Differential inclusion]] ==References== * Pang and Stewart (2006) "Differential Variational Inequalities" to appear. * Aubin and Cellina (1984) ''Differential Inclusions'' Springer-Verlag. * Acary and Brogliato and Goeleven (2006) "Higher order Moreau's sweeping process.

It is a [[meshfree methods|meshfree method]]. The diffuse element method was developed by Nayroles, Touzot and Villon in 1992. It is in concept rather similar to the much older [[smoothed particle hydrodynamics]], though there is no reference to it in their paper. In the paper they describe a "diffuse approximation method", a method for function approximation from a given set of points. In fact it seems they rediscovered an already known technique, [[moving least squares]]. Using this function approximation method, [[partial differential equation]]s and thus [[fluid dynamic]] problems can be solved. For this, they coined the term '''Diffuse Element Method''' (DEM). Advantages over [[finite element method]]s are that DEM doesn't rely on a grid, and is more precise in the evaluation of the derivations of the reconstructed functions. == See also == * [[Finite element method]] * [[Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics]] * [[Meshfree methods]] * [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] == References == * Nayroles, B., Touzot, G. and Villon, P.

It is also called '''skylight''', '''diffuse skylight''', or '''sky radiation''' and is the reason for changes in the colour of the sky. Of the total [[light]] removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere (approximately 25% of the incident radiation when the sun is high in the sky, depending on the amount of dust and haze in the atmosphere), about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse [[sky]] radiation. The important processes in the atmosphere ([[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie theory|Mie scattering]]) are [[elastic scattering|elastic]] processes, by which light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and with no change in wavelength. ==Color== [[Image:Trees-sky.jpg|thumb|200px|Clear blue sky.]] [[Image:Rayleigh sunlight scattering.png|thumb|220px|Comparison of the scattering efficiency of blue light in the atmosphere compared to red light.]] The sunlit sky appears blue because [[air]] scatters short-[[wavelength]] light more than longer wavelengths.
