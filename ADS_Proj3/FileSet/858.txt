This allows the largest and most important scales of the turbulence to be resolved, while greatly reducing the computational cost incurred by the smallest scales. This method requires greater computational resources than RANS methods, but is far cheaper than DNS. ====Detached eddy simulation==== {{main|Detached eddy simulation}} [[Detached eddy simulation]]s (DES) is a modification of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart-Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions. ==== Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes ==== {{main|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations}} [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes]] (RANS) equations are the oldest approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble version of the governing equations is solved, which introduces new ''apparent stresses'' known as [[Reynolds stresses]]. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations do not apply to flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy. RANS models can be divided into two broad approaches: ; [[Boussinesq approximation|Boussinesq hypothesis]]: This method involves using an algebraic equation for the Reynolds stresses which include determining the turbulent viscosity, and depending on the level of sophistication of the model, solving transport equations for determining the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation. Models include k-ε (Spalding {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}), Mixing Length Model (Prandtl {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) and Zero Equation (Chen {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}). The models available in this approach are often referred to by the number of transport equations associated with the method. For example, the Mixing Length model is a "Zero Equation" model because no transport equations are solved; the <math>k-\epsilon</math> is a "Two Equation" model because two transport equations (one for <math>k</math> and one for <math>\epsilon</math>) are solved. ; [[Reynolds stress model]] (RSM): This approach attempts to actually solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. This means introduction of several transport equations for all the Reynolds stresses and hence this approach is much more costly in CPU effort.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ====Coherent vortex simulation==== The coherent vortex simulation approach decomposes the turbulent flow field into a coherent part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow.<ref name="Farge_2001">{{cite journal |title=Coherent Vortex Simulation (CVS), A Semi-Deterministic Turbulence Model Using Wavelets |author1=Farge, Marie |author2=Schneider, Kai |journal=Flow, Turbulence and Combustion |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=393–426 |doi=10.1023/A:1013512726409}}</ref> This decomposition is done using [[wavelet]] filtering. The approach has much in common with LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter. Instead, the filtering operation is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves. Farge and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the <math>-\frac{5}{3}</math> energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures ([[vortex stretching|vortex tubes]]), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures. Goldstein and Oleg<ref name="Goldstein_2004">{{cite journal |author1=Goldstein, Daniel |author2=Vasilyev, Oleg |title=Stochastic coherent adaptive large eddy simulation method |journal=Physics of Fluids A |year=1994 |volume=24 |page=2497 |doi=10.1063/1.1736671}}</ref> applied the CVS model to large eddy simulation, but did not assume that the wavelet filter completely eliminated all coherent motions from the subfilter scales. By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field's coherent portion. ====PDF methods==== Probability density function (PDF) methods for turbulence, first introduced by Lundgren,<ref name="Lundgren_1969">{{cite journal |title=Model equation for nonhomogeneous turbulence |author=Lundgren, T.S. |journal=Physics of Fluids A |volume=12 |issue=3 |year=1969 |pages=485–497 |doi=10.1063/1.1692511}}</ref> are based on tracking the one-point [[probability density function]] of the velocity, <math>f_{V}(\boldsymbol{v};\boldsymbol{x},t) d\boldsymbol{v}</math>, which gives the probability of the velocity at point <math>\boldsymbol{x}</math> being between <math>\boldsymbol{v}</math> and <math>\boldsymbol{v}+d\boldsymbol{v}</math>. This approach is analogous to the [[kinetic theory]] of gases, in which the macroscopic properties of a gas are described by a large number of particles. PDF methods are unique in that they can be applied in the framework of a number of different turbulence models; the main differences occur in the form of the PDF transport equation. For example, in the context of [[large eddy simulation]], the PDF becomes the filtered PDF.<ref name="Colucci_1998">{{cite journal |title=Filtered density
