It generally includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression) and security devices. ==History== Data centers have their roots in the huge computer rooms of the early ages of the computing industry. Early computer systems were complex to operate and maintain, and required a special environment in which to operate. Many cables were necessary to connect all the components, and methods to accommodate and organize these were devised, such as standard [[19-inch rack|rack]]s to mount equipment, [[Raised floor|elevated floor]]s, and [[cable tray]]s (installed overhead or under the elevated floor). Also, old computers required a great deal of power, and had to be cooled to avoid overheating. Security was important – computers were expensive, and were often used for military purposes. Basic design guidelines for controlling access to the computer room were therefore devised. During the boom of the microcomputer industry, and especially during the 1980s, computers started to be deployed everywhere, in many cases with little or no care about operating requirements. However, as [[information technology]] (IT) operations started to grow in complexity, companies grew aware of the need to control IT resources. With the advent of [[Client–server model|client-server]] computing, during the 1990s, microcomputers (now called "[[Server (computing)|servers]]") started to find their places in the old computer rooms. The availability of inexpensive [[Networking hardware|networking]] equipment, coupled with new standards for network cabling, made it possible to use a hierarchical design that put the servers in a specific room inside the company. The use of the term "data center," as applied to specially designed computer rooms, started to gain popular recognition about this time, The boom of data centers came during the [[dot-com bubble]]. Companies needed fast Internet connectivity and nonstop operation to deploy systems and establish a presence on the Internet. Installing such equipment was not viable for many smaller companies. Many companies started building very large facilities, called Internet data centers (IDCs), which provide businesses with a range of solutions
