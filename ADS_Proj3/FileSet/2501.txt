be avoided proactively by design. Next, ''mura'' then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level, such as quality and volume. ''Muda'' is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively. It is seen through variation in output. It is the role of management to examine the ''muda'', in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the ''muri'' and ''mura'' of the system. The ''muda'' and ''mura'' inconsistencies must be fed back to the ''muri'', or planning, stage for the next project. A typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of "making the numbers" as the end of a reporting period approaches. Demand is raised to 'make plan,' increasing (''mura''), when the "numbers" are low, which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process, which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched. This stretch and improvisation leads to ''muri''-style waste, which leads to downtime, mistakes and back flows, and waiting, thus the muda of waiting, correction and movement. The original seven ''muda'' are: * Transport (moving products that is not actually required to perform the processing) * Inventory (all components, [[work in process]] and finished product not being processed) * Motion (people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing) * Waiting (waiting for the next production step) * Overproduction (production ahead of demand) * Over Processing (resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity) * Defects (the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects)<ref>{{cite book |title=Lean Thinking |last=Womack |first=James P. |coauthors=Daniel T. Jones |publisher=Free Press |year=2003 |page=352}}</ref> Later an eighth waste was defined by Womack et al. (2003); it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications. Many others have added the "waste of unused human talent" to the original seven wastes. These wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by Taiichi Ohno in TPS, but were found to be useful additions in practice. For a complete listing of the "old" and "new" wastes see Bicheno and Holweg (2009)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Lean Toolbox|last=Bicheno |first=John |coauthors=Matthias Holweg |publisher=PICSIE Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0954124458}}</ref> Some of these definitions may seem rather idealistic, but this tough definition is seen as important and they drove the success of TPS. The clear identification of non-value-adding work, as distinct from wasted work, is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course.<ref>[http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/jul_aug_04.html ''Toyota Vision and Philosophy'']{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Breakthroughs in [[SMED]] and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challenged. == Lean implementation develops from TPS== The discipline required to implement Lean and the disciplines it seems to require are so often counter-cultural that they have made successful implementation of Lean a major challenge. Some<ref>Pat Lancaster of Lean Thinking's Lanchester Technologies reference implementation</ref> would say that it was a major challenge in its manufacturing 'heartland' as well. Implementations under the Lean label are numerous and whether they are Lean and whether any success or failure can be laid at Lean's door is often debatable. Individual examples of success and failure exist in almost all spheres of business and activity and therefore cannot be taken as indications of whether Lean is particularly applicable to a specific sector of activity. It seems clear from the "successes" that no sector is immune from beneficial possibility.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Lean is about more than just cutting costs in the factory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maskell & Baggaley|title=Practical Lean Accounting|journal=Productivity Press, New York, NY|date=December 19, 2003}}</ref> One crucial insight is that most costs are assigned when a product is designed, (see [[Genichi Taguchi#Off-line quality control|Genichi Taguchi]]). Often an engineer will specify familiar, safe materials and processes rather than inexpensive, efficient ones. This reduces project risk, that is, the cost to the engineer, while increasing financial risks, and decreasing profits. Good organizations develop and review checklists to review product designs. Companies must often look beyond the shop-floor to find opportunities for improving overall company cost and performance. At the [[system engineering]] level, requirements are reviewed with marketing and [[customer representative]]s to eliminate those requirements that are costly. Shared modules may be developed, such as multipurpose power supplies or shared mechanical components or fasteners. Requirements are assigned to the cheapest discipline. For example, adjustments may be moved into software, and measurements away from a mechanical solution to an electronic solution. Another approach is to choose connection or power-transport methods that are cheap or that used standardized components that become available in a competitive market. ===An example program=== In summary, an example of a lean implementation program could be: {| border="1" |- | With a tools-based approach :* [[Senior management]] to agree and discuss their lean vision :* Management brainstorm to identify project leader and set objectives :* Communicate plan and vision to the workforce :* Ask for volunteers to form the Lean Implementation team (5-7 works best, all from different departments) :* Appoint members of the Lean Manufacturing Implementation Team :* Train the Implementation Team in the various lean tools - make a point of trying to visit other non competing businesses that have implemented lean :* Select a Pilot Project to implement – [[5S (methodology)|5S]] is a good place to start :* Run the pilot for 2–3 months - evaluate, review and learn from your mistakes :* Roll out pilot to other factory areas :* Evaluate results, encourage feedback :* Stabilize the positive results by teaching supervisors how to train the new standards you've developed with TWI methodology ([[Training Within Industry]]) :* Once you are satisfied that you have a habitual program, consider introducing the next lean tool.
