that, when properly trained, can allow him to move matter with his mind. ==Publication history== ''The World of Null-A'' appeared originally as a 1945 serial in the magazine ''[[Astounding (magazine)|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', which was edited by [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]] Van Vogt revised and shortened the tale for the 1948 novel release by [[Simon and Schuster]]. In 1970, van Vogt revised it yet again (though only slightly this time), and added an Author's Introduction in which he both defended the controversial work, and admitted that the original serial had been flawed. ==Critical reception== The novel was the subject of an extended critical essay by noted author and critic [[Damon Knight]]. In "Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. van Vogt"<ref name="DK">{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|authorlink=Damon Knight|year=1967|title=[[In Search of Wonder]]|pages=47–62|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}</ref>, Knight writes that "far from being a 'classic' by any reasonable standard, ''The World of Ā'' is one of the worst allegedly-adult science fiction stories ever published." Knight criticizes the novel on four main levels: {{bquote| 1. ''Plot:'' "''The World of Ā'' abounds in contradictions, misleading clues and irrelevant action...It is [van Vogt's] habit to introduce a monster, or a gadget, or an extra-terrestrial culture, simply by naming it, without any explanation of its nature...By this means, and by means of his writing style, which is discursive and hard to follow, van Vogt also obscures his plot to such an extent that when it falls to pieces at the end, the event passes without remark." <BR> 2. ''Characterization:'' "Van Vogt's characters repeatedly commit the error known as the double-take. This phenomenon is funny because it represents a mental failure...Its cause is inability to absorb a new fact until a ridiculously long time has elapsed. In ''The World of Ā'' there are twelve examples in all." <br> 3. ''Background:'' "In van Vogt's world, the advancement over 1945...amounts to no more than (a) a world government; (b) a handful of gadgets...van Vogt has not bothered to integrate the gadgets into the technological background of his story, and he has no clear idea of their nature." <br> 4. ''Style:'' "Examples of bad writing in ''The World of Ā'' could be multiplied endlessly. It is my personal opinion that the whole of it is written badly, with only minor exceptions."}} ==Sequels== ''The World of Null-A'' was followed by the sequels, ''[[The Pawns of Null-A]]'' (also known as ''The Players of Null-A'') (1956) and ''[[Null-A Three]]'' (1984). In 2008 [[John C. Wright (author)|John C. Wright]] wrote a new chapter to the story of Gilbert Gosseyn, ''[[Null-A Continuum]]'', in the style of van Vogt. ==Related works== ''[[Æon Flux]]'' (1991) by [[Peter Chung]] shares many motifs with ''The World of Null-A''. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.conceptualfiction.com/world_of_null_a.html ''The World of Null A '' by A.E. van Vogt], reviewed by Ted Gioia (Conceptual Fiction) * [http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/nullA1chapter.htm Chapter one] online * [http://www.sfsite.com/04a/wn149.htm Review from the SF Site] * [http://www.home.earthlink.net/~icshi/Summaries.html#ThreeWorlds The Three Worlds of Null-A] by Isaac Wilcott (Icshi), analyzing the three different publishings of ''The World of Null-A'' (not its sequels) {{DEFAULTSORT:World Of Null-A}} [[Category:1948 novels]] [[Category:General semantics]] [[Category:Novels by A.

Perhaps most forcefully in his address to the [[University of Valladolid]], Spain in October 2001, he said "According to the [[cybernetician]] the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic dictum. It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, moral judgment or sheer ignorance of circumstances."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beer | first = Stafford | authorlink = Anthony Stafford Beer | year = 2002 | title = What is cybernetics? | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 209–219 | publisher = MCB UP Ltd | doi = 10.1108/03684920210417283 | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/10.1108/03684920210417283 | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref> ==Uses of term== The term is now widely used by [[Systems theory|systems theorists]]. It is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who design, operate or promote it. From a cybernetic perspective [[complex systems]] are not controllable by simple notions of management, and interventions in a system can best be understood by looking at how they affect observed system behavior. When "side effects" or "unintended consequences" reveal that system behavior is poorly understood then taking the POSIWID perspective allows the more political understandings of system behavior to be balanced by a more straightforwardly descriptive view. For example, if the effect of [[world trade]] is to make [[developed nations]] rich at the expense of less developed nations then that is its purpose, and for a cybernetician it is down to the sponsors of world trade to show grounds for the purpose being conceived otherwise.
