SPICE is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit. Board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing. Even with a breadboard, some circuit properties may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board, such as parasitic resistances and capacitances. These parasitic components can often be estimated more accurately using SPICE simulation. Also, designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up. For instance, circuit performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances. In these cases it is common to use SPICE to perform [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of the effect of component variations on performance, a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity. Circuit simulation programs, of which SPICE and derivatives are the most prominent, take a text [[netlist]] describing the circuit elements ([[transistors]], [[resistors]], [[capacitors]], etc.) and their connections, and translate<ref>{{cite journal | first=Colin | last=Warwick | authorlink=Colin Warwick | url=http://www.nutwooduk.co.uk/pdf/Issue82.PDF#page=27 | work = EMC Journal | issue = 82 | pages = 27–29 | date = May 2009 | title = Everything you always wanted to know about SPICE* (*But were afraid to ask) | publisher = Nutwood UK Limited | issn = 1748-9253 | format = PDF }}</ref> this description into equations to be solved.

CANCER was an acronym for "Computer Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits, Excluding Radiation," a hint to Berkeley's liberalism of 1960s: at these times many circuit simulators were developed under the [[United States Department of Defense]] contracts that required the capability to evaluate the [[radiation hardness]] of a circuit. When Nagel's original advisor, Prof. Rohrer, left Berkeley, Prof. Pederson became his advisor. Pederson insisted that CANCER, a proprietary program, be rewritten enough that restrictions could be removed and the program could be put in the public domain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Perry, T. |title=Donald O.

Nodal analysis has limitations in representing inductors, floating voltage sources and the various forms of controlled sources. SPICE1 had relatively few circuit elements available and used a fixed-timestep [[transient analysis]]. The real popularity of SPICE started with SPICE2<ref name=spice2>2nd spice2 ref</ref> in 1975. SPICE2, also coded in FORTRAN, was a much-improved program with more circuit elements, variable timestep transient analysis using either the trapezoidal (second order [[Adams-Moulton method]]) or the Gear integration method (also known as [[Backward differentiation formula|BDF]]), equation formulation via [[modified nodal analysis]]<ref>{{cite conference |author=Ho, Ruehli, and Brennan |title=The Modified Nodal Approach to Network Analysis |booktitle=Proc. 1974 Int.

The last FORTRAN version of SPICE was 2G.6 in 1983. SPICE3<ref>Quarles, Thomas L., ''Analysis of Performance and Convergence Issues for Circuit Simulation'', Memorandum No. UCB/ERL M89/42, University of California, Berkeley, Apr. 1989.</ref> was developed by Thomas Quarles (with [[A. Richard Newton]] as advisor) in 1989. It is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], uses the same netlist syntax, and added [[X Window System]] plotting. As an early [[open source]] program, SPICE was widely distributed and used. Its ubiquity became such that "to SPICE a circuit" remains synonymous with circuit simulation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pescovitz |first=David |url=http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/0502/history.html |title=1972: The release of SPICE, still the industry standard tool for integrated circuit design |publisher=Lab Notes: Research from the Berkeley College of Engineering |date=2002-05-02 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> SPICE source code was from the beginning distributed by UC Berkeley for a nominal charge (to cover the cost of magnetic tape). The license originally included distribution restrictions for countries not considered friendly to the USA, but the source code is currently covered by the [[BSD license]]. SPICE inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs, in academia, in industry, and in commercial products. The first commercial version of SPICE was ISPICE<ref>Vladimirescu, Andrei, ''SPICE -- The Third Decade'', Proc. 1990 IEEE Bipolar Circuits and Technology Meeting, Minneapolis, Sept. 1990, pp. 96&ndash;101</ref>, an interactive version on a timeshare service, [[National CSS]]. The most prominent commercial versions of SPICE include HSPICE (originally commercialized by Shawn and Kim Hailey of Meta Software, but now owned by [[Synopsys]]) and [[PSPICE]] (now owned by [[Cadence Design Systems]]). The academic spinoffs of SPICE include XSPICE, developed at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], which added mixed analog/digital "code models" for behavioral simulation, and Cider (previously CODECS, from UC Berkeley/Oregon State Univ.) which added [[semiconductor device modeling|semiconductor device simulation]]. The integrated circuit industry adopted SPICE quickly, and until commercial versions became well developed many IC design houses had proprietary versions of SPICE.<ref>K. S. Kundert, ''The Designer’s Guide to SPICE and SPECTRE'', Kluwer. Academic Publishers, Boston , 1998</ref> Today a few IC manufacturers, typically the larger companies, have groups continuing to develop SPICE-based circuit simulation programs. Among these are ADICE at [[Analog Devices]], LTspice at [[Linear Technology]], Mica at [[Freescale Semiconductor]], and TISPICE at [[Texas Instruments]]. (Other companies maintain internal circuit simulators which are not directly based upon SPICE, among them PowerSpice at [[IBM]], Titan at [[Qimonda]], Lynx at [[Intel Corporation]], and Pstar at [[NXP Semiconductor]].) == Program features and structure == SPICE became popular because it contained the analyses and models
