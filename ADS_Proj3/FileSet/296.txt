It allows authors to publish articles for free and share knowledge with potential customers. The article database is organized into an [[article directory]], covering a wide variety of subjects, allowing the site to provide readers with content, and providing publishers with free content for their websites, newsletters, or [[e-zine|ezines]]. ==History== ArticlesBase was established by Eyal Halimi and Simon Gelfand in 2005 as a website providing a free platform for content producers to publish their work online (also known as [[article marketing]]). ArticlesBase has rolled out international versions of the site for [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]] and [[Hebrew]] readers. There are currently over 3,000,000<ref name="AB_home">[http://www.articlesbase.com ArticlesBase homepage statistics]</ref> articles published by 300,000<ref name="AB_home" /> authors on the English site alone. ==Content and article format== ArticlesBase contains approximately 240 categories and subcategories ranging from [[health]] and [[education]] to computers and entertainment. Articles must be at least 250 words in length<ref name="content">[http://www.articlesbase.com/editorial-guidelines.php ArticlesBase editorial guidelines]</ref> and may contain up to three [[backlinks]]<ref name="content" /> and an author bio. All articles must be written by the author and must adhere to a set of content guidelines<ref name="content" />. Articles containing pornography or illegal subjects are rejected, and the author’s account may be subject to termination. ==Analytics tools== [[Web analytics]] tools allow users to track visitor [[web traffic|traffic]] and help determine the effectiveness of their article across several objectives. The tool can help authors improve the performance of future submissions and analyzing the past behaviors of their articles by tracking visitor traffic. Parameters include a graph showing the number of visits over different time frames, the [[index term|keywords]] their readers used to find their articles (shown by number and total percentage), and the [[referrer]] through which their readers arrive at ArticlesBase. ==References== <references/> ==External links== *{{Official|http://www.ArticlesBase.com}} *[http://www.crunchbase.com/product/articlesbase-com ArticlesBase profile on CrunchBase] *[http://www.killerstartups.com/Site-Reviews/articlesbase-com-free-online-articles-directory Killer Startups site review] *[http://mashable.com/2008/06/17/yedda-knowledge-community/ ArticlesBase and Yedda Collaboration] Article on [[Mashable]] *[http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000435454 Article in Globes] Israeli Newspaper (Hebrew) *[http://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3103009,00.html Article in Calcalist] Israeli Newspaper (Hebrew) *[http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eyal-halimi-2 Eyal Halimi] on [[CrunchBase]] *[http://www.crunchbase.com/person/simon-gelfand-2 Simon Gelfand] on [[CrunchBase]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Articlesbase}} [[Category:Media companies of Israel]] [[Category:Companies established in 2005]] [[Category:Internet companies of Israel]] [[Category:Social information processing]] [[Category:Multilingual websites]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2444</id> <title>Articulated body pose estimation</title> <text>'''Articulated body pose estimation''', in [[computer vision]], is the study of algorithms and systems that recover the pose of an articulated body, which consists of joints and rigid parts using image-based observations. It is one of longest-lasting problems in computer vision because of the complexity of the models that relate observation with pose, and because of the variety of situations in which it would be useful.<ref>[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/moeslund01survey.html Survey of Computer Vision-Based Human Motion Capture (2001)]</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WCX-4M1DB7H-1/2/8da6f6e7a8c8e07d9331bc7738c6d499 Survey of Advances in Computer Vision-based Human Motion Capture (2006)]</ref> ==Description== There is a need to develop accurate [[tether]]-less, vision-based articulated body pose estimation systems to recover the pose of bodies such as the human body, a hand, or non-human creatures. Such a system have several foreseeable applications, including * Marker-less [[motion capture]] for human-computer interfaces, * [[Physiotherapy]], * [[3D animation]], * [[Ergonomics]] studies, * [[Robot]] control, and * Visual surveillance. One of the major difficulties in recovering pose from images is the high number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) in the body's movement that has to be recovered. Any rigid object requires six DOF to fully describe its pose, and each additional rigid object connected to it adds at least one DOF. A human body contains no less than 10 large body parts, equating to more than 20 DOF. This difficulty is compounded by the problem of self-occlusion, where body parts [[wikt:occlusion|occlude]] each other depending on the configuration of the parts. Other challenges involve dealing with varying lighting, which affect appearance; varying subject attire or body type; required camera configuration; and required computation time. The typical articulated body pose estimation system involves a model-based approach, in which an observation is made and provided as input to the model to generate pose estimates. Different kinds of sensors have been explored for use in making the observation, including * Visible wavelength imagery, * [[Long-wave]] thermal [[infrared]] imagery, * [[TOF-camera|Time-of-flight]] imagery, and * [[Laser range scanner]] imagery. These sensors produce intermediate representations that is directly used by the model; the representations include * Image appearance, * Voxel (volume element) reconstruction, * 3D surface point clouds, and * 3D surface meshes. ==Related technology== A commercially successful but specialized computer vision-based articulated body [[3D Pose Estimation|pose estimation]] technique is optical [[motion capture]]. This approach involves placing markers on the individual at strategic locations to capture the 6 degrees-of-freedom of each body part. ==Active Research Groups== A number of groups are actively pursuing this topic, including groups in Brown University; Carnegie Mellon University; MPI Saarbruecken;
