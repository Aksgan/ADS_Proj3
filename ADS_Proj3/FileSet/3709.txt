desirable to grind it to obtain a smooth finish, but this is likely to be limited to those cases in which the surface irregularities (which will be visible on the radiograph) may make detecting internal defects difficult. After this visual examination, the operator will have a clear idea of the possibilities of access to the two faces of the weld, which is important both for the setting up of the equipment and for the choice of the most appropriate technique. Defects such as [[delamination]]s and [[planar]] cracks are difficult to detect using radiography, which is why penetrants are often used to enhance the contrast in the detection of such defects. Penetrants used include [[silver nitrate]], [[zinc iodide]], [[chloroform]] and [[diiodomethane]]. Choice of the penetrant is determined by the ease with which it can penetrate the cracks and also with which it can be removed. Diiodomethane has the advantages of high [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], ease of [[penetration]], and ease of removal because it evaporates relatively quickly. However, it can cause skin burns. == Safety == Industrial radiography appears to have one of the worst safety profiles of the radiation professions, possibly because there are many operators using strong [[gamma radiation|gamma]] sources (> 2 Ci) in remote sites with little supervision when compared with workers within the [[nuclear power plant|nuclear]] industry or within hospitals. == Standards == ;[[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) *ISO 4993, ''Steel and iron castings - Radiographic inspection'' *ISO 5579, ''Non-destructive testing - Radiographic examination of metallic materials by X- and gamma-rays - Basic rules'' *ISO 10675-1, ''Non-destructive testing of welds - Acceptance levels for radiographic testing - Part 1: Steel, nickel, titanium and their alloys'' *ISO 11699-1, ''Non-destructive testing - Industrial radiographic films - Part 1: Classification of film systems for industrial radiography'' *ISO 11699-2, ''Non-destructive testing - Industrial radiographic films - Part 2: Control of film processing by means of reference values'' *ISO 14096-1, ''Non-destructive testing - Qualification of radiographic film digitisation systems - Part 1: Definitions, quantitative measurements of image quality parameters, standard reference film and qualitative control'' *ISO 14096-2, ''Non-destructive testing - Qualification of radiographic film digitisation systems - Part 2: Minimum requirements'' *ISO 17636, ''Non-destructive testing of welds - Radiographic testing of fusion-welded joints'' *ISO 19232, ''Non-destructive testing - Image quality of radiographs'' ;[[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) *EN 444, ''Non-destructive testing; general principles for the radiographic examination of metallic materials using X-rays and gamma-rays'' *EN 462-2, ''Non-destructive testing - image quality of radiographs - Part 2: image quality indicators (step/hole type) - determination of image quality value'' *EN 462-3, ''Non-destructive testing - Image quality of radiogrammes - Part 3: Image quality classes for ferrous metals'' *EN 462-4, ''Non-destructive testing - Image quality of radiographs - Part 4: Experimental evaluation of image quality values and image quality tables'' *EN 462-5, ''Non-destructive testing - Image quality of radiographs - Part 5: Image quality of indicators (duplex wire type), determination of image unsharpness value'' *EN 584-1, ''Non-destructive testing - Industrial radiographic film - Part 1: Classification of film systems for industrial radiography'' *EN 584-2, ''Non-destructive testing - Industrial radiographic film - Part 2: Control of film processing by means of reference values'' *EN 1330-3, ''Non-destructive testing - Terminology - Part 3: Terms used in industrial radiographic testing'' *EN 1435, ''Non-destructive testing of welds - Radiographic testing of welded joints'' *EN 2002-21, ''Aerospace series - Metallic materials; test methods - Part 21: Radiographic testing of castings'' *EN 10246-10, ''Non-destructive testing of steel tubes - Part 10: Radiographic testing of the weld seam of automatic fusion arc welded steel tubes for the detection of imperfections'' *EN 12517-1, ''Non-destructive testing of welds - Part 1: Evaluation of welded joints in steel, nickel, titanium and their alloys by radiography - Acceptance levels'' *EN 12517-2, ''Non-destructive testing of welds - Part 2: Evaluation of welded joints in aluminium and its alloys by radiography - Acceptance levels'' *EN 12679, ''Non-destructive testing - Determination of the size of industrial radiographic sources - Radiographic method'' *EN 12681, ''Founding - Radiographic examination'' *EN 13068, ''Non-destructive testing - Radioscopic testing'' *EN 14096, ''Non-destructive testing - Qualification of radiographic film digitisation systems'' *EN 14784-1, ''Non-destructive testing - Industrial computed radiography with storage phosphor imaging plates - Part 1: Classification of systems'' *EN 14584-2, ''Non-destructive testing - Industrial computed radiography with storage phosphor imaging plates - Part 2: General principles for testing of metallic materials using X-rays and gamma rays'' ;[[ASTM International]] (ASTM) *ASTM E 94, ''Standard Guide for Radiographic Examination'' *ASTM E 155, ''Standard Reference Radiographs for Inspection of Aluminum and Magnesium Castings'' *ASTM E 592, ''Standard Guide to Obtainable ASTM Equivalent Penetrameter Sensitivity for Radiography of Steel Plates 1/4 to 2 in.
