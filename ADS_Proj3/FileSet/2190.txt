[[Traffic congestion]] has been increasing worldwide as a result of increased [[motorization]], [[urbanization]], [[population growth]], and changes in [[population density]]. Congestion reduces efficiency of [[transportation infrastructure]] and increases travel time, [[air pollution]], and [[fuel consumption]]. The United States, for example, saw large increases in both motorization and urbanization starting in the 1920s that led to migration of the population from the sparsely populated [[rural]] areas and the densely packed [[Urban area|urban]] areas into [[suburbs]]. The [[industrial economy]] replaced the [[agricultural economy]], leading the population to move from rural locations into urban centers. At the same time, motorization was causing cities to expand because motorized transportation could not support the [[population density]] that the existing [[mass transit]] systems could. Suburbs provided a reasonable compromise between population density and access to a wide variety of employment, goods, and services that were available in the more densely populated urban centers. Further, suburban infrastructure could be built quickly, supporting a rapid transition from a rural/agricultural economy to an industrial/urban economy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Recent governmental activity in the area of ITS &ndash; specifically in the [[United States]] &ndash; is further motivated by the perceived need for [[homeland security]]. Many of the proposed ITS systems also involve surveillance of the roadways, which is a priority of homeland security.<ref>Monahan, Torin. 2007. "War Rooms" of the Street: Surveillance Practices in Transportation Control Centers. ''The Communication Review'' 10 (4): 367-389.</ref> Funding of many systems comes either directly through homeland security organizations or with their approval. Further, ITS can play a role in the rapid [[mass evacuation]] of people in urban centers after large casualty events such as a result of a natural disaster or threat. Much of the infrastructure and planning involved with ITS parallels the need for homeland security systems. In the [[developing world]], the migration of people from rural to urbanized habitats has progressed differently. Many areas of the developing world have urbanized without significant motorization and the formation of suburbs. In areas like [[Santiago, Chile]], a high population density is supported by a [[multimodal]] system of walking, [[bicycle]] transportation, [[motorcycle]]s, [[bus]]es, and [[trains]]. A small portion of the population can afford [[automobiles]], but the automobiles greatly increase the congestion in these multimodal transportation systems. They also produce a considerable amount of air pollution, pose a significant safety risk, and exacerbate feelings of inequities in the society. Other parts of the developing world, such as [[China]], remain largely rural but are rapidly urbanizing and industrializing. In these areas a motorized infrastructure is being developed alongside motorization of the population. Great disparity of wealth means that only a fraction of the population can motorize, and therefore the highly dense multimodal [[transportation system]] for the poor is cross-cut by the highly motorized transportation system for the rich. The urban infrastructure is being rapidly developed, providing an opportunity to build new systems that incorporate ITS at early stages. ==Intelligent transport technologies== Intelligent transport systems vary in technologies applied, from basic management systems such as [[car navigation]]; [[traffic signal]] control systems; container management systems; variable message signs; [[automatic number plate recognition]] or [[speed cameras]] to monitor applications, such as security [[CCTV]] systems; and to more advanced applications that integrate live data and feedback from a number of other sources, such as [[parking guidance and information]] systems; weather information; bridge [[deicing]] systems; and the like. Additionally, predictive techniques are being developed in order to allow advanced modeling and comparison with historical baseline data. Some of the constituent technologies typically implemented in ITS are described in the following sections. ===Wireless communications=== Various forms of wireless communications technologies have been proposed for intelligent transportation systems. [[Radio modem]] communication on [[UHF]] and [[VHF]] frequencies are widely used for short and long range communication within ITS. Short-range communications (less than 500 yards) can be accomplished using [[IEEE 802.11]] protocols, specifically [[IEEE 802.11p|WAVE]] or the [[Dedicated Short Range Communications]] standard being promoted by the [[Intelligent Transportation Society of America]] and the [[United States Department of Transportation]]. Theoretically, the range of these protocols can be extended using [[Mobile ad-hoc network]]s or [[Mesh networking]]. Longer range communications have been proposed using infrastructure networks such as [[WiMAX]] ([[IEEE 802.16]]), [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), or [[3G]]. Long-range communications using these methods are well established, but, unlike the short-range protocols, these methods require extensive and very expensive infrastructure deployment. There is lack of consensus as to what business model should support this infrastructure. ===Computational technologies=== Recent advances in [[vehicle electronics]] have led to a move toward fewer, more capable computer processors on a vehicle. A typical vehicle in the early 2000s would have between 20 and 100 individual networked [[microcontroller]]/[[Programmable logic controller]] modules with non-real-time [[operating system]]s. The current trend is toward fewer, more costly [[microprocessor]] modules with hardware [[memory management]] and [[Real-Time Operating System]]s. The new [[embedded system]] [[platforms (computing)|platforms]] allow for more sophisticated [[software application]]s to be implemented, including model-based [[process control]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[ubiquitous computing]]. Perhaps the most important of these for Intelligent Transportation Systems is [[artificial intelligence]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} ===Floating car data/floating cellular data=== {{main|Floating car data}} Virtually every car contains one or more [[mobile phones]]. These mobile phones routinely transmit their location information to the network â€“ even when no voice connection is established. This allows them to be used as anonymous traffic probes. As the car
