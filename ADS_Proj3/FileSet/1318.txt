the output device at low signal levels (as with classes AB and B, but unlike output stages such as class D). If high output powers are needed from a class A circuit, the power waste (and the accompanying heat) will become significant. For every [[watt]] delivered to the [[External electric load|load]], the amplifier itself will, ''at best'', dissipate another watt. For large powers this means very large and expensive power supplies and heat sinking. Class A designs have largely been superseded by the more efficient designs for power amplifiers, though they remain popular with some hobbyists, mostly for their simplicity. Also, many [[audiophile]]s believe that class A gives the best sound quality (for their absence of [[crossover distortion]] and reduced odd-harmonic and high-order harmonic [[Audio distortion|distortion]]) which provides a small market for expensive '''high fidelity''' class A amps. ==== Single-ended and triode class A amplifiers ==== Some aficionados who prefer class A amplifiers also prefer the use of [[thermionic valve]] (or "tube") designs instead of transistors, especially in [[Single-ended triode]] output configurations for several claimed reasons: * Single-ended output stages (be they tube or transistor) have an asymmetrical [[transfer function]], meaning that even harmonics in the created distortion tend not to be canceled (as they are in [[push-pull output]] stages); by using tubes OR [[FET]]s most of the distortion is from the [[square law]] [[transfer characteristic]] and so second-order, which some consider to be "warmer" and more pleasant.<ref>[http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2005/october/content/content2.html Ask the Doctors: Tube vs. Solid-State Harmonics]</ref><ref>[http://www.trueaudio.com/at_eetjlm.htm Volume cranked up in amp debate]</ref> * For those who prefer low distortion figures, the use of tubes with class A (generating little odd-harmonic distortion, as mentioned above) together with symmetrical circuits (such as push-pull output stages, or balanced low-level stages) results in the cancellation of most of the even distortion harmonics, hence the removal of most of the distortion. * Though good amplifier design can reduce harmonic distortion patterns to almost nothing, distortion is essential to the sound of [[electric guitar]] amplifiers, for example, and is held by recording engineers to offer more flattering microphones and to enhance "clinical-sounding" digital technology. * Historically, valve amplifiers often used a class A power amplifier simply because valves are large and expensive; many class A designs use only a single device. Transistors are much cheaper, and so more elaborate designs that give greater efficiency but use more parts are still cost-effective. A classic application for a pair of class A devices is the [[long-tailed pair]], which is exceptionally linear, and forms the basis of many more complex circuits, including many audio amplifiers and almost all [[operational amplifier|op-amps]]. Class A amplifiers are often used in output stages of high quality [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]s (although the accuracy of the bias in low cost op-amps such as the '''741''' may result in class A or class AB or class B, varying from device to device or with temperature). They are sometimes used as medium-power, low-efficiency, and high-cost audio amplifiers. The power consumption is unrelated to the output power. At idle (no input), the power consumption is essentially the same as at high output volume. The result is low efficiency and high heat dissipation. === Class B and AB === Class B amplifiers only amplify half of the input wave cycle, thus creating a large amount of distortion, but their efficiency is greatly improved and is much better than class A. Class B has a maximum theoretical efficiency of 78.5% (i.e., π/4). This is because the amplifying element is switched off altogether half of the time, and so cannot dissipate power. A single class B element is rarely found in practice, though it has been used for driving the [[loudspeaker]] in the early [[IBM Personal Computer]]s with beeps, and it can be used in [[RF power amplifier]] where the distortion levels are less important. However, class C is more commonly used for this. [[Image:Electronic Amplifier Class B fixed.png|right|thumb|Class B amplifier]] A practical circuit using class B elements is the [[push-pull output|push-pull stage]], such as the very simplified complementary pair arrangement shown below. Here, complementary or quasi-complementary devices are each used for amplifying the opposite halves of the input signal, which is then recombined at the output. This arrangement gives excellent efficiency, but can suffer from the drawback that there is a small mismatch in the cross-over region - at the "joins" between the two halves of the signal, as one output device has to take over supplying power exactly as the other finishes. This is called [[crossover distortion]]. An improvement is to bias the devices so they are not completely off when they're not in use. This approach is called ''class AB'' operation. In class AB operation, each device operates the same way as in class B over half the waveform, but also conducts a small amount on the other half. As a result, the region where both devices simultaneously are nearly off (the "dead zone") is reduced. The result is that when the waveforms from the two devices are combined, the crossover is greatly minimised or eliminated altogether. The exact choice of '''quiescent current''', the standing current through both devices when there is no signal, makes a large difference to the level of [[Audio distortion|distortion]] (and to the risk of [[thermal runaway]], that may damage the devices); often the bias voltage applied to set this quiescent current has to be adjusted with the temperature of the output transistors (for example in the circuit at the beginning of the article the diodes would be mounted physically close to the output transistors, and chosen to have a matched temperature coefficient). Another approach (often used as well as thermally-tracking bias voltages) is to include small value resistors in series with the emitters. Class AB sacrifices some efficiency over class B in favor of linearity, thus is less efficient (below 78.5% for full-amplitude [[sinewave]]s in transistor amplifiers, typically; much less is common in class AB [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers). It is typically much more efficient than class A. [[Image:Electronic Amplifier Push-pull.svg|right|thumb|Class B push–pull amplifier]] Class B
