"excuse") for expected poor performance in the future, as opposed to an [[Attribution theory#Internal versus external|internal attribution]].<ref name=JonesBerglas1978/> More recent research has found that generally people are willing to use handicaps in order to protect their [[self-esteem]] (e.g. discounting failings) but are more reluctant to employ them for [[self-enhancement]]. (e.g. to further credit their success). Rhodewalt, Morf, Hazlett, and Fairfield (1991)<ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /> selected participants who scored high or low on the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS) and who had high or low self-esteem. They presented participants with a handicap and then with success of failure feedback and asked participants to make attributions for their performance. The results showed that both self-protection and [[self-enhancement]] occurred, but only as a function of levels of [[self-esteem]] and the level of tendency to self-handicap. Participants who were high self-handicappers, regardless of their level of [[self-esteem]], used the handicap as a means of self-protection but only those participants with high [[self-esteem]] used the handicap to [[self-enhancement|self-enhance]]. In a further study, Rhodewalt (1991)<ref name=Rhodewaltetal1991>Rhodewalt, F., Morf, C, Hazlett, S., & Fairfield, M. (1991). Self-handicapping: The role of discounting and augmentation in the preservation of self-esteem. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61,'' 121-131</ref> presented the handicap to only half of the participants and gave success and failure feedback. The results provided evidence for self-protection but not for self-enhancement. Participants in the failure feedback, handicap absent group, attributed their failures to their own lack of ability and reported lower self-esteem to the handicap-present, failure-feedback condition. Furthermore, the handicap-present failure group reported levels of self-esteem equal to that of the successful group. This evidence highlights the importance of self-handicaps in self-protection although it offers no support for the handicap acting to self-enhance. ==Individual Differences== People differ in the extent to which they self-handicap<ref name=Rhodewalt1990>Rhodewalt, F.
