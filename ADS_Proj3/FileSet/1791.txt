2010}} The formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires, at minimum, unary negation and [[quantification|quantified]] [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]]. Leibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime; most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts. In his book ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] went so far as to claim that Leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later. ==Mathematician== Although the mathematical notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]] was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, Leibniz was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as [[abscissa]], [[ordinate]], [[tangent]], [[chord (geometry)|chord]], and the [[Surface normal|perpendicular]].<ref>Struik (1969), 367</ref> In the 18th century, "function" lost these geometrical associations. Leibniz was the first to see that the coefficients of a system of [[linear equation]]s could be arranged into an array, now called a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], which can be manipulated to find the solution of the system, if any. This method was later called [[Gaussian elimination]]. Leibniz's discoveries of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], also relevant to mathematics, are discussed in the preceding section. A detailed{{Citation needed|reason=Under the circumstances, we cannot use Bos as a reference that it is a detailed treatment.|date=February 2010}} treatment of Leibniz's writings on the calculus may be found in Bos (1974). ===Calculus=== Leibniz is credited, along with Sir [[Isaac Newton]], with the inventing of [[infinitesimal calculus]] (that comprises differential and integral calculus). According to Leibniz's notebooks, a critical breakthrough occurred on 11 November 1675, when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x''). He introduced several notations used to this day, for instance the [[integral sign]] ∫ representing an elongated S, from the Latin word ''summa'' and the ''d'' used for [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]], from the Latin word ''differentia''. This cleverly suggestive notation for the calculus is probably his most enduring mathematical legacy. Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684.<ref>For an English translation of this paper, see Struik (1969: 271–84), who also translates parts of two other key papers by Leibniz on the calculus.</ref> The [[product rule]] of [[differential calculus]] is still called "Leibniz's law". In addition, the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the [[Leibniz integral rule]]. Leibniz's approach to the calculus fell well short of later standards of rigor (the same can be said of Newton's). We now see a Leibniz proof as being in truth mostly a [[heuristic]] argument mainly grounded in geometric intuition. Leibniz also freely invoked mathematical entities he called [[infinitesimal]]s, manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had [[paradox]]ical [[algebra]]ic properties. [[George Berkeley]], in a tract called ''The Analyst'' and elsewhere,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} ridiculed this and other aspects of the early calculus, pointing out that natural science grounded in the calculus required just as big of a leap of [[faith]] as [[theology]] grounded in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[revelation]].{{Off-topic?|date=July 2010}} From 1711 until his death, Leibniz's life was envenomed by [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|a long dispute]] with John Keill, Newton, and others, over whether Leibniz had invented the calculus independently of Newton, or whether he had merely invented another notation for ideas that were fundamentally Newton's.<ref>Hall (1980) gives a thorough scholarly discussion of the calculus priority dispute.</ref> Modern, rigorous calculus emerged in the 19th century, thanks to the efforts of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], [[Karl Weierstrass]], and others, who based their work on the definition of a [[limit of a function|limit]] and on a precise understanding of [[real number]]s. While Cauchy still used infinitesimals as a foundational concept for the calculus, following Weierstrass they were gradually eliminated from calculus, though continued to be studied outside of analysis. Infinitesimals survived in science and engineering, and even in rigorous mathematics, via the fundamental computational device known as the [[differential (mathematics)|differential]]. Beginning in 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] worked out a rigorous foundation for Leibniz's infinitesimals, using [[model theory]]. The resulting [[non-standard analysis]] can be seen as a belated vindication of Leibniz's mathematical reasoning. ===Topology=== Leibniz was the first to use the term ''analysis situs'',<ref>Loemker §27</ref> later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as [[topology]]. There are two takes on this situation. On the one hand, Mates, citing a 1954 paper in German by [[Jacob Freudenthal]], argues: <blockquote>Although for Leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer [[Euler]], in the famous 1736 paper solving the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg|Königsberg Bridge Problem]] and its generalizations, used the term ''geometria situs'' in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ...it is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.<ref>Mates (1986), 240</ref></blockquote> But [[Hideaki Hirano]] argues differently, quoting [[Benoît Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm|title=Leibniz's Cultural Pluralism And Natural Law|last=HIRANO|first=Hideaki|language=en|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> <blockquote>To sample Leibniz' scientific works is a sobering experience. Next to calculus, and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion, the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming. We saw examples in 'packing,'... My Leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling. In "Euclidis Prota"..., which is an attempt to tighten Euclid's axioms, he states,...: 'I have diverse definitions for the straight line. The straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole, and it alone has this property, not only among curves but among sets.' This claim can be proved today.<ref>Mandelbrot (1977), 419. Quoted in Hirano (1997).</ref></blockquote> Thus the [[fractal|fractal geometry]] promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions
