oriented matroids is discussed further below. Matroids are often useful in areas such as [[Dimension theory (algebra)|dimension theory]] and [[algorithms]]. Because of an oriented matroid's inclusion of additional details about the ''oriented'' nature of a structure, its usefulness extends further into several areas including [[geometry]] and [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. ==Axiomatizations== {{See also|Matroid|Greedoid|Antimatroid|Axiomatic system|Cryptomorphism}} {{Expand section|other sets of axioms.|date=February 2010}} Like ordinary matroids, several equivalent [[Axiomatic system|systems of axioms]] exist. (Such structures that possess multiple equivalent axiomatizations are called [[cryptomorphism|cryptomorphic]].) === Circuit axioms === ====Signed sets==== Before we list the ''circuit axioms'' a few terms must be defined. * A ''signed set'', <math>X</math>, combines a set of objects <math>\underline{X}</math> with a partition of that set into two subsets: <math>X^+</math> and <math>X^-</math>. : The members of <math>X^+</math> are called the ''positive elements''; members of <math>X^-</math> are the ''negative elements''. * The set <math>\underline{X} = X^+ \cup X^-</math> is called the ''support'' of <math>X</math>. * The ''empty signed set'', <math> \empty </math> is defined in the obvious way. * The signed set <math>Y</math> is the ''opposite'' of <math>X</math>, i.e., <math>Y = -X</math>, if and only if <math>Y^+ = X^-</math> and <math>Y^- = X^+</math> The concept of ''signed sets'' is key to distinguishing oriented from ordinary matroids. ====Axioms==== Let <math>E</math> be any set. We refer to <math>E</math> as the ''ground set''. Let <math>\mathcal{C}</math> be a collection of ''signed sets'', each of which is ''supported'' by a subset of <math>E</math>. If the following axioms hold for <math>\mathcal{C}</math>, then equivalently <math>\mathcal{C}</math> is the set of ''signed circuits'' for an ''oriented matroid'' on <math>E</math>. * (C0) <math>\empty \notin \mathcal{C}</math> * (C1) (symmetric) <math>\mathcal{C} = -\mathcal{C}</math> * (C2) (incomparable) <math>\mbox{ for all } X,Y \in \mathcal{C} \mbox{ if } \underline{X} \subseteq \underline{Y}, \mbox{ then } X=Y \mbox{ or } X = -Y</math> * (C3) (weak elimination) <math>\mbox{ for all } X,Y \in \mathcal{C}, X \neq Y, \mbox{ and } e \in X^+ \cap Y^- \mbox{ there is a } Z \in \mathcal{C} \mbox{ such that }</math> ** <math> Z^+ \subseteq (X^+ \cup Y^+)\setminus\{e\} \mbox{ and }</math> ** <math> Z^- \subseteq (X^- \cup Y^-)\setminus\{e\}.</math> ==Examples== {{Expand section|specific examples|date=February 2010}} Oriented matroids are often introduced (e.g., Bachem and Kern) as an abstraction for directed graphs or systems of linear inequalities. Thus, it may be helpful to first be knowledgeable of the structures for which oriented matroids are an abstraction. Several of these topics are listed below. ===Directed graphs=== {{Main|Directed graph}} {{See also|Network flow}} ===Linear optimization=== {{Main|Linear programming}} {{See also|Simplex algorithm}} ===Convex polytope=== {{Main|Convex polytope}} For example, Ziegler introduces oriented matroids via convex polytopes. ==Results== ===Algebra: duality and polarity=== {{See also|Matroid#Matroid duality|Duality (projective geometry)|Pole and polar|Duality (mathematics)|Involution (mathematics)}} Oriented matroids have a satisfying theory of [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]].<ref>In oriented-matroid theory, [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] differs from [[Symmetric_bilinear_form#Orthogonal_polarities|polarity]]; see Bachem and Kern, Chapters 5.11, 6, 7.2.</ref> ===Geometry=== {{Main|Combinatorial geometry}} {{See also|Convex polytope|Antimatroid}} The theory of oriented matroids has influenced the development of [[combinatorial geometry]], especially the theory of [[convex polytope]]s, [[zonotope]]s, and of configurations of vectors ([[arrangement of hyperplanes|arrangements of hyperplanes]]).<ref>Bachem and Kern, Chapters 1–2 and 4–9. Björner et alia, Chapters 1–8. Ziegler, Chapter 7–8. Bokowski, Chapters 7–10.</ref> Many results—[[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)|Carathéodory's theorem]], [[Helly's theorem]], [[Radon's theorem]], the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]], the [[Krein–Milman theorem]], the [[Farkas lemma|lemma of Farkas]]—can be formulated using appropriate oriented matroids.<ref>Bachem and Wanka, Chapters 1–2, 5, 7–9. Björner et alia, Chapter 8.</ref> Similarly, [[matroid theory]] is useful for developing combinatorial notions of [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]], [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]], etc. In combinatorial convexity, the notion of an [[antimatroid]] is also useful. ===Optimization=== {{Main|Combinatorial optimization|Optimization (mathematics)}} {{See also|Linear programming|Simplex algorithm|Quadratic programming|Greedy algorithm}} The theory of oriented matroids (OM) has led to break-throughs in [[combinatorial optimization]]. In [[linear programming]], OM theory was the language in which Bland formulated his pivoting rule by which the [[simplex algorithm]] avoids cycles; similarly, OM theory was used by Terlakey and Zhang to prove that their <!-- versions of the --> criss-cross algorithms have finite termination for [[linear programming]] problems. Similar results were made in convex [[quadratic programming]] by Todd and Terlaky.<ref>Björner et alia, Chapters 8-9. Fukuda and Terlaky. Compare Ziegler.</ref> Outside of [[combinatorial optimization]], OM theory also appears in [[convex minimization]] in Rockafellar's theory of "monotropic programming" and related notions of "fortified descent".<ref>[[Rockafellar]] 1984 and 1998.</ref> Similarly, [[matroid|matroid theory]] has influenced the development of combinatorial algorithms, particularly the [[greedy algorithm]].<ref>Lawler. [[Rockafellar]] 1984 and 1998.</ref> More generally, a [[greedoid]] is useful for studying the finite termination of algorithms. ==References== <references/> <!-- {{More footnotes|date=January 2010}} --> ==Further reading== ===Books=== * A.
