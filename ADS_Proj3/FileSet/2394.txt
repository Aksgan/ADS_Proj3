possible to define a kd-tree with points stored solely in leaves.<ref>de Berg, Mark et al. Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications, 3rd Edition, pages 99-101. Springer, 2008.</ref> This form of kd-tree allows a variety of split mechanics other than the standard median split. The midpoint splitting rule<ref name="midpointsplit">S. Maneewongvatana and [[David Mount|D. M. Mount]]. [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/Papers/cgc99-smpack.pdf It's okay to be skinny, if your friends are fat]. 4th Annual CGC Workshop on Computational Geometry, 1999.</ref> selects on the middle of the longest axis of the space being searched, regardless of the distribution of points. This guarantees that the aspect ratio will be at most 2:1, but the depth is dependent on the distribution of points. A variation, called sliding-midpoint, only splits on the middle if there are points on both sides of the split. Otherwise, it splits on point nearest to the middle. Maneewongvatana and Mount show that this offers "good enough" performance on common data sets. Using sliding-midpoint, an [[Nearest neighbor search#Approximate_nearest_neighbor|approximate nearest neighbor]] query can be answered in <math>O \left ( \frac{ 1 }{ { \epsilon\ }^d } \log n \right )</math>. Approximate range counting can be answered in <math>O \left ( \log n + { \left ( \frac{1}{ \epsilon\ } \right ) }^d \right )</math> with this method. ==See also== * [[implicit kd-tree|implicit ''k''d-tree]] * [[min/max kd-tree|min/max ''k''d-tree]] * [[Quadtree]] * [[Octree]] * [[Bounding Interval Hierarchy]] * [[Nearest neighbor search]] * [[Klee's measure problem]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://libkdtree.alioth.debian.org libkdtree++], an open-source STL-like implementation of ''k''d-trees in C++. * [http://www.autonlab.org/autonweb/14665/version/2/part/5/data/moore-tutorial.pdf?branch=main&language=en A tutorial on KD Trees] * [http://babel.isa.uma.es/mrpt/index.php/The_hierarchical_model_of_metric_maps#Point_maps A C++ implementation of ''k''d-trees for 3D point clouds], part of the [[Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit| Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT)]] * [http://code.google.com/p/kdtree/ kdtree] A simple C library for working with KD-Trees * [http://donar.umiacs.umd.edu/quadtree/points/kdtree.html K-D Tree Demo, Java applet] * [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/ libANN] Approximate Nearest Neighbor Library includes a kd-tree implementation * [http://www.vision.caltech.edu/malaa/software/research/image-search/ Caltech Large Scale Image Search Toolbox]: a Matlab toolbox implementing randomized Kd-Trees for fast approximate nearest neighbor search, in addition to [[Locality sensitive hashing|LSH]], Hierarchical K-Means, and [[Inverted file|Inverted File]] search algorithms. {{CS-Trees}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Kd-Tree}} [[Category:Computer graphics data structures]] [[Category:Trees (structure)]] [[Category:Geometric algorithms]] [[Category:Database index techniques]] [[de:K-d-Baum]] [[es:Árbol kd]] [[fa:درخت کی‌دی]] [[fr:Arbre kd]] [[he:עץ kd]] [[ja:Kd木]] [[pl:Drzewo kd]] [[sl:KD drevo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20484</id> <title>Keith Bostic</title> <text>{{for|the football player of the same name|Keith Bostic (American football)}} {{infobox person | name = Keith Bostic | birth_date = {{birth date and age|1959|07|26}} | employer = [[UC Berkeley]] [[Computer Systems Research Group|CSRG]]; later, (until Feb. 2008), {{nowrap begin}}[[Sleepycat Software]]{{nowrap end}} / {{nowrap begin}}[[Oracle Corporation]]{{nowrap end}} | known = [[nvi]], [[Free and open source software|FLOSS]] version of [[BSD UNIX]] | website = [http://www.bostic.com/keith.html www.bostic.com/keith.html] }} '''Keith Bostic''' (born July 26, 1959) is a [[computer programmer]] from the [[United States]].
