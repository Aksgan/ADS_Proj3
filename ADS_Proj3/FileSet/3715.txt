licensing company. The company became particularly well known for its aggressive [[intellectual property]] based litigation practices following the introduction of [[DDR-SDRAM]] memory. == History == Rambus, a California company, was incorporated in 1990 and re-incorporated in Delaware in 1997. The company was listed on [[NASDAQ]] in 1997 under the code RMBS. As of February 2006, Rambus derived the majority of its annual revenue by licensing patents for chip interfaces to its customers. Companies such as [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], [[Elpida Memory|Elpida]], [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.|Matsushita]], [[NEC|NECEL]], [[Qimonda]], [[Renesas Technology|Renesas]], [[Sony]], and [[Toshiba]] have taken licenses to Rambus patents for use in their own products.<ref>[http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2006%2f02%2f21%2f0001193125-06-035902.html#FIS_BUSINESS RAMBUS FORM 10-K]</ref> Rambus' share price has ranged between a high of nearly $150 in 2000 to a low of approximately $3 in 2002 with a 4:1 split on June 15, 2000. Rambus' share price in the first quarter of 2010 was between $20 and $24, giving the firm a market cap value of around 2.5 billion US dollars <ref>[http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=RMBS&selected=RMBS]</ref>. == Technology == [[File:Rambus HQ patent wall section.JPG|thumb|Plaques on a wall at the Rambus headquarters in [[Los Altos, California]], each representing a U.S. patent issued to the company.]] The first PC motherboards with support for [[RDRAM]] debuted in 1999. They supported PC800 RDRAM, which operated at 400 MHz but presented data on both rise and fall of clock cycle resulting in effectively 800 MHz, and delivered 1600 MB/s of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] over a 16-bit bus using a 184-pin [[RDRAM|RIMM]] form factor. This was significantly faster than the previous standard, PC133 SDRAM, which operated at 133 MHz and delivered 1066 MB/s of bandwidth over a 64-bit bus using a 168-pin [[DIMM]] form factor. Some downsides of RDRAM technology, however, included significantly increased [[RAM latency|latency]], heat output, manufacturing complexity, and cost. PC800 RDRAM operated with a minimum latency of 45 ns, compared to 15 ns for PC133 SDRAM. RDRAMs can also be told to increase their latencies in order to prevent the possibility of two or more chips transmitting at the same time and causing a collision. However, SDRAM latency depends on the current state of memory so its latency can vary widely depending on what happened earlier and the strategy used by the SDRAM controller, while RDRAM latency is constant once it has been established by the memory controller. RDRAM memory chips also put out significantly more heat than SDRAM chips, necessitating [[heatsink]]s on all RIMM devices. RDRAM also includes a memory controller on each memory chip, significantly increasing manufacturing complexity compared to SDRAM, which used a single memory controller located on the [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] chipset. RDRAM was also two to three times the price of PC133 SDRAM due to manufacturing costs, license fees and other market factors. However, Rambus has alleged that some of those market factors included memory maker price fixing in order to drive RDRAM out of the market in favor of DDR SDRAM. A case of DRAM price-fixing was exposed by the [[United States Department of Justice]], with the details found in the article [[DRAM price fixing]]. DDR SDRAM, introduced in 2000, operated at an effective clockspeed of 266 MHz and delivered 2100 MB/s over a 64-bit bus using a 184-pin DIMM form factor. With the introduction of the [[Intel 840]] chipset, dual-channel support was added for PC800 RDRAM, doubling bandwidth to 3200 MB/s by increasing the bus width to 32-bit. This was followed in 2002 by the [[Intel 850E]] chipset, which introduced PC1066 RDRAM, increasing total dual-channel bandwidth to 4200 MB/s. Also in 2002, Intel released the [[E7205]] chipset, which introduced dual-channel DDR support for a total bandwidth of 4200 MB/s, but at a much lower latency than competing RDRAM. In 2003, Intel released the [[875P]] chipset, and along with it dual-channel DDR400. With a total bandwidth of 6400 MB/s, it marked the end of RDRAM as a technology with competitive performance. Rambus survived the obsolescence of RDRAM and moved to support DDR and DDR2 in the area of video card technology and in particular, [[PCI Express]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Rambus also developed and licensed its [[XDR RAM]] technology. == Lawsuits == {{Undue|date=October 2009}} In the early 1990s, Rambus was invited to join the [[Joint Electron Device Engineering Council|JEDEC]]. Rambus had been trying to interest memory manufacturers in licensing their proprietary memory interface, and numerous companies had signed [[non-disclosure agreement]]s to view Rambus' technical data. During the later ''Infineon v. Rambus'' trial, [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] memos from a meeting with representatives of other manufacturers surfaced, including the line “[O]ne day all computers will be built this way, but hopefully without the royalties going to Rambus”, and continuing with a strategy discussion for reducing or eliminating royalties to be paid to Rambus. As Rambus continued its participation in JEDEC, it became apparent that they were not prepared to agree to JEDEC’s patent policy requiring owners of patents included in a standard to agree to license that technology under terms that are ‘reasonable and non-discriminatory’,<ref>More precisely, “that a license will be made available to applicants desiring to implement the standard either without compensation or under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination”; §8.2 of the JEDEC Manual of Organization and Procedure (JM21-L), http://www.jedec.org/Home/manuals/JM21L.pdf</ref> and Rambus withdrew from the organization in 1995. Memos from Rambus at that time showed they were tailoring new patent applications to cover features of SDRAM being discussed, which were public knowledge (JEDEC meetings were not considered secret) and perfectly legal for patent owners who have patented underlying innovations, but were seen as evidence of bad faith by the jury in the first ''Infineon v. Rambus'' trial. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC)]] rejected this theory of bad faith in its decision overturning the fraud conviction Infineon achieved in the first trial (see below). In 2000, Rambus began filing lawsuits against the largest memory manufacturers, claiming that they owned SDRAM and DDR technology. Seven manufacturers, including [[Samsung]], quickly settled with Rambus and agreed
