considered as modulating the output of the power supply.

The gain may be specified as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage ([[voltage gain]]), output power to input power ([[power gain]]), or some combination of current, voltage and power. In many cases, with input and output in the same units, gain will be unitless (although often expressed in [[decibels]]); for others this is not necessarily so. For example, a [[transconductance amplifier]] has a gain with units of [[conductance]] (output current per input voltage). The power gain of an amplifier depends on the source and load impedances used as well as its voltage gain; while an [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifier may have its impedances optimized for power transfer, audio and instrumentation amplifiers are normally employed with amplifier input and output impedances optimized for least loading and highest quality. So an amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20 dB might have a voltage gain of ten times and an available power gain of much more than 20 dB (100 times power ratio), yet be delivering a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is a 600 ohm microphone and the output is a 47 kilohm power amplifier's input socket. In most cases an amplifier should be linear; that is, the gain should be constant for any combination of input and output signal. If the gain is not constant, e.g., by clipping the output signal at the limits of its capabilities, the output signal will be distorted. There are however cases where [[Variable-gain amplifier|variable gain]] is useful. There are many types of electronic amplifiers, commonly used in [[radio]] and [[television]] [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[high-fidelity]] ("hi-fi") stereo equipment, microcomputers and other electronic digital equipment, and [[guitar]] and other [[instrument amplifier]]s. Critical components include [[active device]]s, such as [[vacuum tube]]s or [[transistor]]s. A brief introduction to the many types of electronic amplifier follows. ===Power amplifier=== The term "power amplifier" is a relative term with respect to the amount of power delivered to the load and/or sourced by the supply circuit. In general a power amplifier is designated as the last amplifier in a transmission chain (the ''output stage'') and is the amplifier stage that typically requires most attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to various classes of power amplifier: see [[Electronic amplifier#Power amplifier classes|power amplifier classes]]. === Vacuum tube (valve) amplifiers === {{Main|Valve amplifier}} [[File:Kt88 power tubes in traynor yba200 amplifier.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|The glow from four "Electro Harmonix KT88" brand power tubes lights up the inside of a Traynor YBA-200 guitar amplifier]] According to Symons, while semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low power applications, valve amplifiers are much more cost effective in high power applications such as "radar, countermeasures equipment, or communications equipment" (p. 56). Many [[#Microwave amplifiers|microwave amplifiers]] are specially designed valves, such as the [[klystron]], [[gyrotron]], [[traveling wave tube]], and [[crossed-field amplifier]], and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices (p. 59).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Robert S. Symons | title=Tubes: Still vital after all these years | journal=IEEE Spectrum | year=1998 | volume=35 | issue=4 | pages= 52&ndash;63 | doi=10.1109/6.666962 }}</ref> Valves/tube amplifiers also have niche uses in other areas, such as * [[Electric guitar]] amplification * in Russian military aircraft, for their [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] tolerance * niche audio for their sound qualities (recording, and [[audiophile]] equipment) === Transistor amplifiers === {{Main|Transistor|Bipolar junction transistor|Audio amplifier|MOSFET}} The essential role of this active element is to magnify an input signal to yield a significantly larger output signal. The amount of magnification (the "forward gain") is determined by the external circuit design as well as the active device. Many common active devices in transistor amplifiers are [[bipolar junction transistor]]s (BJTs) and [[metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s ([[MOSFET]]s). Applications are numerous, some common examples are audio amplifiers in a home stereo or [[Public address|PA system]], RF high power generation for semiconductor equipment, to RF and Microwave applications such as radio transmitters. Transistor-based amplifier can be realized using various configurations: for example with a bipolar junction transistor we can realize [[common base]], [[common collector]] or [[common emitter]] amplifier; using a MOSFET we can realize [[common gate]], [[common source]] or [[common drain]] amplifier. Each configuration has different characteristic (gain, impedance...). === Operational amplifiers (op-amps) === {{Main|Operational amplifier|Instrumentation amplifier}} An operational amplifier is an amplifier circuit with very high open loop gain and differential inputs which employs external feedback for control of its transfer function or [[gain]]. Although the term is today commonly applied to integrated circuits, the original operational amplifier design was implemented with valves. === Fully differential amplifiers (FDA) === {{Main|Fully differential amplifier}} A fully differential amplifier is a solid state integrated circuit amplifier which employs external feedback for control of its transfer function or [[gain]]. It is similar to the operational amplifier but it also has differential output pins. === Video amplifiers === These deal with video signals and have varying bandwidths depending on whether the video signal is for SDTV, EDTV, HDTV 720p or 1080i/p etc.. The specification of the bandwidth itself depends on what kind of filter is used and which point ({{nowrap|-1 dB}} or {{nowrap|-3 dB}} for example) the bandwidth is measured. Certain requirements for step response and overshoot are necessary in order for acceptable TV images to be presented. ==== Oscilloscope vertical amplifiers ==== These are used to deal with video signals to drive an oscilloscope display tube and can have bandwidths of about {{nowrap|500 MHz}}.
