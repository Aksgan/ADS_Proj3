The primary goal of Fresh is to make programming in assembly as fast and efficient as in other visual languages, without sacrificing the small application size and the raw power of assembly language. Because Fresh is the logical continuation of the [[FASM]] project in the area of visual programming, it is perfectly compatible with FASM. Fresh can be used for Windows programming, but also to create programs for any OS that FASM supports - [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[BeOS]], [[MenuetOS]] - the same way as is done in FASM. Sadly, this site has not been updated in quite some time & has been taken down (August, 2008). It now redirects to FASM's main page for the time being. ==External links== * [http://fresh.flatassembler.net/ The homepage of Fresh] {{Unreferenced|date=June 2007}} [[Category:Assembly languages]] [[Category:Open source integrated development environments]] [[ru:Fresh (IDE)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14264</id> <title>Freshman studies</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=December 2009}} '''Freshman studies''' is a required course at many [[liberal arts]] colleges in the [[United States]]. In general, it is mandatory for all freshman to take at least one or two terms. Most programs seek to panoptically introduce students to a variety of material outside of their immediate interests, foster academic debate, and encourage students to become better writers. The idea was created by [[Lawrence University]] President [[Nathan M. Pusey]] in 1945 and first implemented by Professor Waple, who chaired the Freshman Studies Committee at that school. {{DEFAULTSORT:Freshman Studies}} [[Category:Lawrence University]] [[Category:Interdisciplinary fields]] {{US-edu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14265</id> <title>Freshwater Biological Association</title> <text>{{advert|date=December 2010}} {{refimprove|date=December 2010}} The '''Freshwater Biological Association''' (FBA) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] membership association, independent scientific organisation and a registered charity. Founded in 1929, it promotes freshwater science through innovative research, maintained specialist scientific facilities, a programme of scientific meetings, production of publications, and by providing sound independent scientific opinion. The FBA hosts both published and unpublished collections, two specialist libraries and varieties of long term data sets from sites of scientific significance. Located on the shore of [[Windermere (lake)|Windermere]] close to the village of [[Far Sawrey]], in Cumbria and alongside the River Frome at East Stoke in Dorset the FBA is managed by The Director, Dr Michael Dobson who is assisted by 25 staff (17 full time equivalents). A board of trustees, elected by the members, guide the strategic direction of the Association in line with the charitable objectives. The FBA is a registered charity, number 214440 and a company limited by guarantee, registration number 263162, England. ==Activities== The FBA is involved in many activities which include the support of Science through the use of its location in The Lake District in Cumbria and alongside the River Frome, East Stoke in Dorset and uses its location to support scientific work by providing specialist facilities and equipment. The FBA is also involved in research through grants and studentships given to young scientists,
