Mathematics Teacher (CMathTeach). ==Publications== ===''Mathematics Today''=== ''Mathematics Today'' is a general interest mathematics publication aimed primarily at Institute members, published 6 times a year and containing articles, reviews, reports and other news on developments in mathematics and its applications.<ref name="mathstoday">http://www.ima.org.uk/mathematics/mathstoday.htm</ref> ===Research journals=== Six research journals are published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the IMA.<ref name="journals">http://www.ima.org.uk/mathematics/journals.htm</ref> *''IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics'' *''IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis'' *''Mathematical Medicine and Biology'' *''IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information'' *''IMA Journal of Management Mathematics'' *''Teaching Mathematics and its Applications'' ===Other publications=== The IMA began publishing a podcast, ''Travels in a Mathematical World'' on 4 October 2008.<ref name="podcast">http://www.travelsinamathematicalworld.co.uk/</ref> The IMA also publishes conference proceedings, monographs and special interest group newsletters.<ref name="otherpubs">http://www.ima.org.uk/mathematics/publications.htm</ref> ==Conferences== The Institute runs 8-10 conferences<ref name="conference diary">http://www.ima.org.uk/Conferences/confdiary.htm</ref> most years. These are specialist meetings where new research is presented and discussed.<ref name="conferences">http://www.ima.org.uk/Conferences/conferences.htm</ref> ==Education activities== The IMA runs a wide range of mathematical activities through The Higher Education Services Area and The Schools and Further Education Group committees.<ref name="Education committees">http://www.ima.org.uk/Education/educationintro.htm</ref> The IMA operates a Programme Approval Scheme, which provides an 'approval in principle' for degree courses that meet the educational requirements for [[Chartered Mathematician]]. For programmes to be approved, the IMA requires the programme to be a honours degree of at least three years length, which meets the required mathematical content threshold of two thirds. The programmes also need to meet the [[QAA]] benchmark for Mathematics and the Framework for High Education Qualification.<ref name="programmeapproval">http://ima.org.uk/Education/programmeapproval.htm</ref> The IMA provides Education Grants of up to £600 to allow individuals from the UK working in schools or Further/Higher Education to help with the attendance at or the organisation of a mathematics educational activity such as attendance at a conference, expenses to cover a speaker coming into a school, organising a session for a conference. <ref name="EducationGrants">http://www.ima.org.uk/Education/education_grant.html#report</ref> The IMA also employs a University Liaison Officer to promote mathematics and the IMA to university students undertaking mathematics and help act as a means of support. <ref name="UniversityLiaison">http://www.ima.org.uk/student/index.html</ref> As part of this support the IMA runs the University Liaison Grants Scheme to provide university mathematical societies with grants of up to £400 to organise more activities and work more closely with the IMA. ==Prizes== The Councils of the IMA and the [[London Mathematical Society]] jointly award the Christopher Zeeman Medal, dedicated to recognising excellence in the communication of mathematics <ref name="zeemanmedal">http://www.lms.ac.uk/activities/prizes_com/zeeman.html</ref> and the David Crighton Award dedicated to the recognition of service to mathematics and the wider mathematics community.<ref name="crightonmedal">http://www.lms.ac.uk/activities/prizes_com/crighton.html</ref> The IMA with the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium (BAMC) award a prize for original research every two years, this is called the Lighthill-Thwaites Prize. The IMA awards the [[Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis]], the Catherine Richards Prize for the best articles in Mathematics Today and the IMA Gold Medal for outstanding contribution to mathematics and its applications over the years. The IMA awards student-level Prizes at most universities which offer mathematics around the UK. Each student prize consists of a years membership of the IMA.<ref name="studentprizes">http://travelsinamathematicalworld.blogspot.com/2008/11/ima-prize-giving-at-kings.html</ref> ==Branches== The IMA has Branches in the regions [[London]], [[East Midlands]], [[Lancashire]] and the [[Portal:North West England|North West]], [[West Midlands]], [[West of England]], [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]],<ref name="branches">http://www.ima.org.uk/Branches/branches.htm</ref> which run local activities (like talks by well known mathematicians). ==Early Career Mathematicians Group== The Early Career Mathematicians Group of the IMA hold a series of conferences for mathematicians in the first 15 years of their career among other activities. ==Social networking== As well as all the conferences meetings and group activities that are held across the country the IMA operates groups on [[Facebook]],<ref name="facebook">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7633226353</ref> [[MySpace]] <ref name="myspace">http://groups.myspace.com/imauk</ref> and [[LinkedIn]].<ref name="linkedin">http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/701007</ref> ==Interaction with other bodies== Along with the [[London Mathematical Society]], the [[Royal Statistical Society]], the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] and the [[Operational Research Society]], forms the [[Council for the Mathematical Sciences]].<ref name="cms">http://www.cms.ac.uk/</ref> The IMA is a member of the [[Joint Council of Mathematics]] (JMC) and informs the deliberations of the [[Advisory Committee for Mathematical Education]] (ACME).<ref name="education">http://www.ima.org.uk/Education/educationintro.htm</ref> The IMA has representatives on [[University of Bath|Bath University Court]], [[Bradford University|Bradford University Court]], [[Cranfield University|Cranfield University Court]], [[Engineering Technology Board]] and [[Engineering Council]], [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]], EPSRC Public Understanding of Science Committee, [[HoDoMS|Heads of Departments of Mathematical Sciences]], [[International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], [[Joint Mathematical Council]], LMS Computer Science Committee, LMS International Affairs Committee, LMS Women in Maths Committee, [[Maths, Stats & OR Network]] (part of the HEA), [[Parliamentary and Scientific Committee]], [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]], [[Science Council]], Science Council Registration Authority, [[The Association of Management Sciences]] (TAMS) and [[University of Wales, Swansea]] Court <ref name="reps">http://www.ima.org.uk/institute/external_committees.html</ref> == See also == *[[List of Mathematical Societies]] *[[Council for the Mathematical Sciences]] *[[Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis]] ==Notes== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.ima.org.uk/institute/aboutus.htm The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications] *[http://www.ima.org.uk/institute/origins_of_the_institute.pdf Article on the origins of the Institute] *[http://www.travelsinamathematicalworld.co.uk Travels in a Mathematical World Podcast] {{The European Mathematical Society}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Institute Of Mathematics And Its Applications}} [[Category:1964 establishments]] [[Category:Mathematical societies]] [[Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom]] [[Category:British professional bodies|Mathematics and its Applications, Institute of]] [[Category:Southend-on-Sea]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18546</id> <title>Institute of Patentees and Inventors</title> <text>The '''Institute of Patentees and Inventors''' is a [[United Kingdom]]-based non-profit making association.
