the Weil conjectures for other spaces, such as Grassmannians, that have the same property. ===Elliptic curves=== These give the first non-trivial cases of the Weil conjectures (proved by Hasse). If ''E'' is an elliptic curve over a finite field with ''q'' elements, then the number of points of ''E'' defined over the field with ''q<sup>m</sup>'' elements is 1 &minus; α<sup>''m''</sup>&minus; β<sup>''m''</sup> + ''q''<sup>''m''</sup>, where α and β are complex conjugates with absolute value √''q''. The zeta function is : ζ(''E'',''s'') = (1 &minus; α''q''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>)(1 &minus; β''q''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>) / (1 &minus; ''q''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>)(1 &minus; ''q''<sup>1&minus;''s''</sup>). ==Weil cohomology== Weil suggested that the conjectures would follow from the existence of a suitable "[[Weil cohomology theory]]" for varieties over finite fields, similar to the usual cohomology with rational coefficients for complex varieties. His idea was that if ''F'' is the [[Frobenius automorphism]] over the finite field, then the number of points of the variety ''X'' over the field of order ''q''<sup>''m''</sup> is the number of fixed points of ''F''<sup>''m''</sup> (acting on all points of the variety ''X'' defined over the algebraic closure). In algebraic topology the number of fixed points of an automorphism can be worked out using the [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]], given as an alternating sum of traces on the [[cohomology group]]s. So if there were similar cohomology groups for varieties over finite fields, then the zeta function could be expressed in terms of them. The first problem with this is that the coefficient field for a Weil cohomology theory cannot be the rational numbers. To see this consider the case of a [[supersingular]] [[elliptic curve]] over a finite field of characteristic ''p''. The endomorphism ring of this is an order in a [[quaternion algebra]] over the rationals, and should act on the first cohomology group, which should be a 2 dimensional vector space over the coefficient field by analogy with the case of a complex elliptic curve. However a quaternion algebra over the rationals cannot act on a 2 dimensional vector space over the rationals. The same argument eliminates the possibility of the coefficient field being the reals or the ''p''-adic numbers, because the quaternion algebra is still a division algebra over these fields. However it does not eliminate the possibility that the coefficient field is the field of ''l''-adic numbers for some prime ''l'' ≠ ''p'', because over these fields the division algebra splits and becomes a matrix algebra, which can act on a 2-dimensional vector space. Grothendieck and [[Michael Artin]] managed to construct suitable cohomology theories over the field of ''l''-adic numbers for each prime ''l'' ≠ ''p'', called [[l-adic cohomology]]. ==Grothendieck's formula for the zeta function== Grothendieck proved an analogue of the Lefschetz fixed point formula for ''l''-adic cohomology theory, and by applying it to the Frobenius automorphism ''F'' was able to prove the following formula for the zeta function. :<math>\zeta(s)=\frac{P_1(T)\cdots P_{2n-1}(T)}{P_0(T)P_2(T)\cdots P_{2n}(T)}</math> where each polynomial ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> is the determinant of ''I &minus; TF'' on the ''l''-adic cohomology group ''H''<sup>''i''</sup>. The rationality of the zeta function follows immediately. The functional equation for the zeta function follows from Poincare duality for ''l''-adic cohomology, and the relation with complex Betti numbers of a lift follows from a comparison theorem between ''l''-adic and ordinary cohomology for complex varieties. More generally, Grothendieck proved a similar formula for the zeta function of a sheaf ''F''<sub>0</sub>: :<math>Z(X_0, F_0, t) = \prod_{x\in |X_0|}\det(1-F^*_xt^{deg(x)}|F_0)^{-1}</math> as a product over cohomology groups: :<math>Z(X_0, F_0, t) = \prod_{i}\det(1-F^* t|H^i_c(F))^{(-1)^{i+1}}</math> The special case of the constant sheaf gives the usual zeta function. ==Deligne's first proof== {{harvtxt|Verdier|1974}}, {{harvtxt|Serre|1975}}, {{harvtxt|Katz|1976}} and {{harvtxt|Freitag|Kiehl|1988}} gave expository accounts of the first proof {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}}. Much of the background in ''l''-adic cohomology is described in {{harv|Deligne|1977}}. Deligne's first proof of the Weil conjectures used the following steps: ===Use of Lefschetz pencils=== *Grothendieck expressed the zeta function in terms of the trace of Frobenius on ''l''-adic cohomology groups, so the Weil conjectures for a ''d''-dimensional variety ''V'' over a finite field with ''q'' elements depend on showing that the eigenvalues &alpha; of Frobenius acting on the ''i'''th ''l''-adic cohomology group ''H''<sup>''i''</sup>(''V'') of ''V'' have absolute values |&alpha;|=''q''<sup>''i''/2</sup> (for an embedding of the algebraic elements of '''Q'''<sub>''l''</sub> into the complex numbers). *After [[blowing up]] ''V'' and extending the base field, one may assume that the variety ''V'' has a morphism onto the projective line '''P'''<sup>1</sup>, with a finite number of singular fibers with very mild (quadratic) singularities. The theory of monodromy of [[Lefschetz pencil]]s, introduced for complex varieties (and ordinary cohomology) by {{harvtxt|Lefschetz|1924}}, and extended by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1972}} and {{harvtxt|Deligne|Katz|1973}} to ''l''-adic cohomology, relates the cohomology of ''V'' to that of its fibers. The relation depends on the space ''E''<sub>''x''</sub> of '''vanishing cycles''', the subspace of the cohomology ''H''<sup>''d''&minus;1</sup>(''V''<sub>''x''</sub>) of a non-singular fiber ''V''<sub>''x''</sub>, spanned by classes that vanish on singular fibers. *The [[Leray spectral sequence]] relates the middle cohomology group of ''V'' to the cohomology of the fiber and base. The hard part to deal with is more or less a group ''H''<sup>1</sup>(''P''<sup>1</sup>, ''j''<sub>*</sub>''E'') = ''H''{{su|p=1|b=c}}(''U'',''E''), where ''U'' is the points the projective line with non-singular fibers, and ''j'' is the inclusion of ''U'' into the projective line, and ''E'' is the sheaf with fibers the spaces ''E''<sub>''x''</sub> of vanishing cycles. ===The key estimate=== The heart of Deligne's proof is to show that the sheaf ''E'' over ''U'' is pure, in other words to find the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Frobenius on its stalks. This is done by studying the zeta functions of the even powers ''E''<sup>''k''</sup> of ''E'' and applying Grothendieck's formula for the zeta functions as alternating products over cohomology groups. The crucial idea of considering even ''k'' powers of ''E'' was inspired by the paper {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Robert Alexander Rankin|last=Rankin|year=1939}}, who used a similar idea with ''k''=2 for bounding the [[Ramanujan tau function]]. Langlands commented that a generalization of Rankin's result for higher even values of ''k'' would imply the [[Ramanujan conjecture]], and Deligne realized that in the case of zeta functions of varieties, Grothendieck's theory of zeta functions of sheaves provided an analogue of this generalization. *The
