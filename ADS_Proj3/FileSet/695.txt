The CIO is evolving into a role where he/she is creating and monitoring business value from IT assets, to the point where Potts in [[FruITion (novel)]] suggests that the Chief Information Officer (CIO) be replaced with Chief Internal Investments Officer (CIIO).<ref name="SH10">[http://www.technicspub.com/product.sc?productId=7&categoryId=1 fruITion: Creating the Ultimate Corporate Strategy for Information Technology, Chris Potts, Technics Publications, LLC 2008]</ref> Another way that the CIO role is changing is an increased focus on service management.<ref name="servMgmt"> [http://www.cio.com/article/558564/Recession_Shifts_IT_Service_Management_Into_Fast_Lane CIO Magazine: Recession Shifts IT Service Management into Fast Lane]</ref> As [[SaaS]], [[IaaS]], [[BPO]] and other more flexible value delivery techniques are brought into organizations the CIO usually functions as a 3rd party manager for the organization. == See also == * [[Fractional CIO]] * [[Chief technology officer]] * [[Geospatial Information Officer]] * [[IT Governance]] * [[IT Strategy]] == References == <references/> == External links == * [http://www.cio.gov US Federal CIO Council] * [http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/cio.aspx UK Government - CIO Council] Dead link as on 4th Nov 2010, unable to find new official site. * [http://esaconf.un.org/WB/default.asp?action=9&boardid=10&read=3538&fid=97 The Chief Information Officer Concept in E-government: Lessons for Developing Countries.] By D.C.

It is used for authenticating users of a wireless LAN. It supports web based login, which is today's standard for public [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|HotSpot]]s, [[Wireless Internet service provider|WISP]] "smart-client" authentication, and it supports [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA and [[WPA2]]). Authentication, authorization and accounting ([[AAA protocol]]) is handled via [[RADIUS]] (on board or remote). Development on the original project continues, but slowly for some. The [[CoovaChilli|Coova-Chilli]] is an active project and has since added many new features and is an integral part of the [[CoovaAP]] firmware. As of mid-2008, ChilliSpot appears to be very dead. The developer Jens Jacobsen has vanished, and the chillispot.org domain has lapsed. ==Uses in firmware== ;[[CoovaAP]] :An [[OpenWrt]] based firmware with many hotspot specific features. ;[[DD-WRT]] :ChilliSpot is included in the latest builds of the open source DD-WRT firmware package. ;[[OpenWRT]] :Chillispot is included as an optional package in the [[OpenWRT]] linux distribution for wireless routers. ==Uses in software== ;[[FON]] :ChilliSpot is used in [[FON]]'s FONSPOT software that turns a regular Mac/Linux/PC machine into a FON spot. ==See also== *[[DD-WRT]] ==External links== *[http://www.chillispot.info/ Unofficial ChilliSpot homepage] (copy of original with ads inserted) *[http://www.coova.org/CoovaChilli CoovaChilli homepage] *[http://pepperspot.sourceforge.net/index.php PepperSpot - fork of ChilliSpot with IPv6 support] [[Category:Authentication methods]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6104</id> <title>ChinesePython</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = ChinesePython | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = | latest release version = 2.1.3 | latest release date = {{release date and age|2003|07|24}} | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | programming_language = | operating system = | platform = | genre = Python Programming Language Interpreter | license = | website = http://www.chinesepython.org/ }} '''ChinesePython''' (中蟒) is an implementation of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] [[programming language]] using the Chinese language [[lexicon]].

It poses additional difficulties due to the Chinese characters (which frequently have different pronunciations in different contexts), the complex [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] which is essential to convey the meaning of words, and sometimes the difficulty in obtaining agreement among native speakers concerning what is the correct pronunciation of certain phonemes. ==Approaches taken== ===Corpus-based (iFlyTek and SinoSonic)=== Anhui USTC iFlyTek Co., Ltd (iFlyTek) published a [[W3C]] paper in which they adapted [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] to produce a mark-up language called Chinese Speech Synthesis Markup Language (CSSML) which can include additional markup to clarify the pronunciation of characters and to add some prosody information.<ref>http://www.w3.org/2005/08/SSML/Papers/iFLYTech.pdf</ref> Their synthesiser takes a "corpus-based" approach, which means it can sound very natural in most cases but can err in dealing with unusual phrases if they can't be matched with the corpus. The amount of data involved is not disclosed by iFlyTek but can be seen from the commercial products that iFlyTek
