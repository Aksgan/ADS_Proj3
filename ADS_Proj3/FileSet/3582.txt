acquisition and structuring of knowledge in PBL is thought to work through the following [[cognition|cognitive]] effects (Schmidt, 1993): *initial analysis of the problem and activation of prior knowledge through small-group discussion *elaboration on prior knowledge and active processing of new information *restructuring of knowledge, construction of a semantic network *social knowledge construction *learning in context *stimulation of curiosity related to presentation of a relevant problem ===Other outcomes of problem-based learning=== One of the aims of PBL is the development of self-directed learning (SDL) skills. In Loyens, Magda & Rikers' discussion (2008), SDL is defined as “a process in which individuals take the initiative…in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes.” By being invited into the learning process, students are also invited to take responsibility for their learning, which leads to and increase in self-directed learning skills. In Severiens and Schmidt’s study of 305 first year college students, they found that PBL and its focus on SDL led to motivation for students to maintain study pace, led to social and academic integration, encouraged development of cognitive skills, and fostered more study progress then students in a conventional learning setting (2009). PBL invites learners to take a place in the academic world through inquiring and discovery that is central to problem-based learning. ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Refbegin}} * Armstrong E: A hybrid model of problem-based learning.

It is a [[philosophy]] of how an organization manages its operations, aligned with and supported by the [[Goal (management)|vision]], [[mission statement|mission]] and values of the organization. The process is the basis on which decisions are made and actions are taken. It is oriented toward achieving a vision rather than targeting specific activities and tasks of individual functions. The general process is that the vision determines the necessary [[strategy]], structure and [[Human resources|human resource]] requirements for the organisation. It can also be used on the [[project management]] level in that a clear vision of a project defines the strategy, structure and resources required to achieve success. The project process continues with the implementation of the tasks and activities required to achieve the vision. Most companies are focused around organizational performance such as budgets, incentives, costs, and skill development. Process Based Management adds these performance measures but in an operational way that adds to the organizational measures. Over time, the process measures take a stronger role. The "Order to Cash" process for instance is what brings revenue into a company, but often, conventional companies are so focused on their individual departments that the cross functional process is an afterthought. Performance suffers because of this. CAM-I is currently performing research on this concept. (www.cam-i.org) Needs to cash is the core process for many organizations. Order to cash ignores all that must happen before receiving the order. From customer needs to cash in the bank focuses attention on the organization's processes for learning of customer needs, translating those needs into product specifications, translating the product specifications into production process specifications, realizing the product by running the production processes, delivering the product and invoicing for the delivery of conforming product. Since 1986, QMI has used and improved their [http://www.aworldofquality.com/diy people>processes>system] methodology to enable its clients to develop their process-based management systems. These systems conform to international standards for process-based management systems including ISO 9001 and its derivatives. These management systems are used to provide confidence that
