regulary take part in the World Championships and other recognized leagues starting to compete.However the event is still seen as a Non Ranking event and any awards or titles given in the tournament are not officially recognized outside the event. The World Series is a Multiple Tournament contest in which a players performance in each separate tournament is scored, and after a number of Tournaments within the event have taken place, a Triple Elimination Playoff takes place to decide a overall Championship. Over the last few seasons extra events have been added to the series, the most popular of them being the Hidden Stars (a tournament for Novice players on the application who may not know about the event being given a chance to compete without any regulars taking part) and the World Series Blitz (where all the events take place over 1 day rather than once a week like in the main event). The key feature of this event is the number of players who are not known as people who play in real-life tournaments who show a lot of ambition to try and compete with those who Play in the most recognized events on a regular basis. This has created a small Community of players as well as a small rivalry between both sets of players to prove who is better {| class="wikitable" |- ! Season !! Overall Result !! League Phase !!
