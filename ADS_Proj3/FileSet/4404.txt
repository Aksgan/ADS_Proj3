This means nothing less than that he will be forced to be free.... {{Harv|Rousseau|1762|p=18}} </blockquote> Even [[Herman Melville]], in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', has the cannibal harpooner Queequeg explain why he has saved the life of someone who had been jeering him as so: <blockquote> "It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians." {{Harv|Melville|1851|p=96}} </blockquote> The original role of government is to provide the coercive power to enforce the social contract (and in commercial societies, contracts and covenants generally). Where government does not exist or cannot reach it is often deemed the role of religion to promote prosocial and moral behavior, but this tends to depend on threats of hell-fire (what Hobbes called "the terror of some power"); such inducements seem more mystical than rational, and philosophers have been hard-pressed to explain why self-interest should yield to morality, why there should be any duty to be "good".<ref> See {{Harvnb|Gauthier|1970}} for a lively debate on morality and self-interest. Aristotle's comment on the effectivness of philosophic argument: "For the many yield to complusion more than to argument." (Nichomachean Ethics, Book X, 1180a15, Irwin translation)</ref> Yet cooperation, and even altruism and morality, are prevalent, even in the absence of coercion, even though it seems that a properly self-regarding individual should reject all such social strictures and limitations. As early as 1890 the Russian naturalist <!-- Yes, Kroptkin was an anarchist, but is not really releveant here --> [[Petr Kropotkin]] observed that the species that survived were where the individuals cooperated, that "mutual aid" (cooperation) was found at all levels of existence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kropotkin|1902}}, but originally published in the magazine ''Nineteenth Century'' starting in 1890.</ref> By the 1960s biologists and zoologists were noting many instances in the real "jungle" where real animals &ndash; presumably unfettered by conscience and not corrupted by altruistic liberals &ndash; were cooperating.<ref> {{Harvnb|Axelrod|1984|pp=90}}; {{Harvnb|Trivers|1971}}. </ref> Darwin's theory of natural selection is a profoundly powerful explanation of how evolution works; its undoubted success strongly suggests an inherently antagonistic relationship between unrelated individuals. Yet cooperation is prevalent, seems beneficial, and even seems to be essential to human society. Explaining this seeming contradiction, and accommodating cooperation, and even altruism, within Darwinian theory is a central issue in the theory of cooperation. == Modern developments == Darwin's explanation of how evolution works is quite simple, but the implications of how it might explain complex phenomena are not at all obvious; it has taken over a century to elaborate (see [[modern synthesis]]).<ref>See {{Harvtxt|Bowler|1984}} generally.</ref> Explaining how [[altruism]] &ndash; which by definition reduces personal fitness &ndash; can arise by natural selection is a particular problem, and the central theoretical problem of [[sociobiology]].<ref name="Wilson 1975">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1975}}.</ref> A possible explanation of altruism is provided by the theory of [[group selection]] (first suggested by Darwin himself while grappling with issue of social insects<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=237}}.</ref>) which argues that natural selection can act on groups''':''' groups that are more successful &ndash; for any reason, including learned behaviors &ndash; will benefit the individuals of the group, even if they are not related. It has had a powerful appeal, but has not been fully persuasive, in part because of difficulties regarding cheaters that participate in the group without contributing.<ref> {{Harvnb|Axelrod|Hamilton|1981}}; {{Harvnb|Trivers|1971|pp=44, 48}}; {{Harvnb|Bowler|1984|p=312}}; {{Harvnb|Dawkins|1989}}, pp. 7&ndash;10, 287, ch. 7 generally.</ref> Another explanation is provided by the [[kin selection|genetic kinship theory]] of [[W. D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]]:<ref>{{Harvnb|Hamilton|1964}}.</ref> if a gene causes an individual to help other individuals that carry copies of that gene, then the ''gene'' has a net benefit even with the sacrifice of a few individuals. The classic example is the social insects, where the workers &ndash; which are sterile, and therefore incapable of passing on their genes &ndash; benefit the queen, who is essentially passing on copies of "their" genes. This is further elaborated in the "selfish gene" theory of [[Richard Dawkins]], that the unit of evolution is not the individual organism, but the gene.<ref name="Dawkins 1989"/> (As stated by Wilson: "the organism is only DNA's way of making more DNA."<ref name="Wilson 1975"/>) However, kinship selection works only where the individuals involved are closely related; it fails to explain the presence of altruism and cooperation between unrelated individuals, particularly across species. In a 1971 paper<ref>{{Harvnb|Trivers|1971}}.</ref> [[Robert Trivers]] demonstrated how [[reciprocal altruism]] can evolve between unrelated individuals, even between individuals of entirely different species. And the relationship of the individuals involved is exactly analogous to the situation in a certain form of the Prisoner's Dilemma.<ref>{{Harvnb|Trivers|1971|pp=38â€“39}}.</ref> The key is that in the ''iterated'' Prisoner's Dilemma, or IPD, both parties can benefit from the exchange of many seemingly altruistic acts. As Trivers says, it "take[s] the altruism out of altruism."<ref>{{Harvnb|Trivers|1971|p=35}}.</ref> The Randian premise that self-interest is paramount is largely unchallenged, but turned on its head by recognition of a broader, more profound view of what constitutes self-interest. It does not matter why the individuals cooperate. The individuals may be prompted to the exchange of "altruistic" acts by entirely different genes, or no genes in particular, but both individuals (and their genomes) can benefit simply on the basis of a shared exchange. In particular, "the benefits of human altruism are to be seen as coming directly from reciprocity &ndash; not indirectly through non-altruistic group benefits".<ref>{{Harvnb|Trivers|1971|p=47}}. More pointedly, Trivers also said (p. 48):"No concept of group advantage is necessary to explain the function of human
