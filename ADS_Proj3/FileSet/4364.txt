field of [[electrical engineering]] it has numerous correlations with the engineering sciences. However, the perspective of TI is not marked by the technical disciplines alone but the focus is rather on giving special emphasis to typical aspects of informatics in order to find more general and universal solutions.<ref>[http://www.international-office.fh-koeln.de/english/faculties/overview/f10/courses/u/01602.php Technical Informatics (diploma) description]</ref>. This discipline is usually taught at [[vocational university]]s up to a Master degree level<ref>[http://intoffice.fh-wedel.de/masterdegrees/masters-course-computer-science/focus-computer-engineering/modules-technical-informatics-master/ Modules Technical Informatics Master]</ref>. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Computer science education]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36928</id> <title>Technical support</title> <text>{{For|technical support in finance|Support and resistance}} [[Image:Attdevicesupportcenter.jpg|thumb|right|[[AT&T Mobility]] provides technical support for some of its [[mobile phone]]s through Device Support Centers.]] Application Support or '''Technical support''' (also ''tech support'') is a range of [[Customer service|services]] providing assistance with technology products such as mobile phones, televisions, [[computer]]s, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods. In general, technical support services attempt to help the user solve specific problems with a product—rather than providing training, customization, or other support services. Most companies offer technical support for the products they sell, either freely available or for a fee. Technical support may be delivered over the [[telephone]] or online by [[e-mail]] or a [[web site]] or a tool where users can log a call/incident. Larger organizations frequently have internal technical support available to their staff for computer related problems. The internet is also a good source for freely available tech support, where experienced users may provide advice and assistance with problems. In addition, some fee-based service companies charge for premium technical support services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4387525.stm |title=Technical support for the neighbours |accessdate=2008-03-06 | work=BBC News | date=2005-03-28}}</ref> ==Coverage of support== Technical support may be delivered by different technologies depending on the situation. For example, [[direct question]]s can be addressed using [[Short message service|SMS]], [[Online chat]], [[E-mail]] or [[Fax]]; basic software problems can be addressed over the telephone or, increasingly, by using remote access repair services; while more complicated problems with hardware may need to be dealt with in person. ==Types of Technical Support== ===Time and Material=== This type of technical support has been very common in the services industry. It is also known as "Break-Fix" IT Support. The concept behind this type of support is that the customer pays for the materials (Hard Drive, Memory, Computer, etc.) as well as pays the technician based on their pre-negotiated rate when they have a problem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foruminfotech.net/types_of_technical_supports.html |title=Types of Technical Support}}</ref> ===Block Hours=== Block Hours is basically a way to purchase a bunch of hours upfront to pay a reduced hourly rate. The premise behind this type of support is that the customer has negotiated a discounted rate and a fixed number of hours to use either per month or year. This allows them the flexibility to use the hours as they please without doing the paperwork and the hassle of paying multiple bills. ===Managed Services=== [[Managed Services]] means a company will receive a list of well-defined services on an ongoing basis, with well-defined "response and resolution times" for a fixed rate or a flat fee. This can include things like 24/7 Monitoring of Servers, 24/7 [[Help desk]] for your daily computer issues and On-site visits by a [[technician]] when issues cannot be resolved remotely. Some companies also offer additional services like [[Project Management]] and Vendor management in the monthly price. ==Outsourcing technical support== With the increasing use of technology in modern times, there is a growing requirement to provide technical support. Many organizations locate their technical support departments or [[call centers]] in countries with lower costs. There has also been a growth in companies specializing in providing technical support to other organizations. These are often referred to as MSP's (Managed Service Providers)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatvoiceco.com/wp_maggiek.html |title=Call Centre Trends |accessdate=2008-05-02 |last=Berkley |first=Susan |coauthors=Maggie Klenke |work=The Great Voice Company }}</ref> For businesses needing to provide technical support, [[outsourcing]] allows them to maintain a high availability of service. Such need may result from peaks in call volumes during the day, periods of high activity due to introduction of new products or maintenance service packs, or the requirement to provide customers with a high level of service at a low cost to the business. <ref name=eHelp>{{cite web | url=http://www.e-help-desk.com/whitepaper0011.html | title= Outsourcing the Helpdesk | year= 2006| work= eHelp Desk Resource |accessdate= 2008-05-06 }}</ref> For businesses needing technical support assets, [[outsourcing]] enables their core employees to focus more on their work in order to maintain productivity.<ref name= perkins>{{cite web | author= Perkins, Bart | url=http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2004/0,4814,97239,00.html | title= Outsourcing: First Ask Why?| date= 2004-11-08| work= [[Computerworld]] Management |accessdate= 2008-05-06 }}</ref> It also enables them to utilize specialized personnel whose technical knowledge base and experience may exceed the scope of the business, thus providing a higher level of technical support to their employees. ==Multi-tiered technical support== Technical support is often subdivided into tiers, or levels, in order to better serve a business or customer base. The number of levels a business uses to organize their technical support group is dependent on a business’ need, want, or desire as it revolves around their ability to sufficiently serve their customers or users. The reason for providing a multi-tiered support system instead of one general support group is to provide the best possible service in the most efficient possible manner. Success of the organizational structure is dependent on the technicians’ understanding of their level of responsibility and commitments, their customer response time commitments, and when to appropriately escalate an issue and to which level.<ref name=walker>{{cite book | last= Walker| first =Gary | title= IT Problem Management (Harris Kern’s Enterprise Computing Institute Series) | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | location=Upper Saddle River | year = 2001 | pages=85–113| isbn=013030770X |id=[[Google Book Search]]|accessdate = 2008-05-06 }}</ref> A common support structure revolves around a three-tiered technical support system. ===Level 1(L1)=== This is the initial support level responsible for basic customer issues. It is synonymous with first-line support, level 1 support, front-end support, support line 1, and various other headings denoting basic level technical support functions. The first job of a Tier I specialist is to gather the customer’s information and to
