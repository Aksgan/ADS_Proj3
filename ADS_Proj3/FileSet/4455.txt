target of 500,000 to 1 million units for their Tianhua GX-1C model. The GX-1C uses a Loongson I (Longxin) CPU similar to that used in the commercially distributed [[Longmeng]] Municator from a Chinese startup named ''Yellow Sheep River''. Loongson (Longxin) translates as "Dragon Chip". Sinomanic has created four different models for distribution to specific markets. The '''Tianhua GX-1''' and '''Tianhua GX-1C''' are marketed for education. The '''Tian Yan GX-2''' is a rural computer marketed for farmers, Tian Yan is designed to be used with a [[television]] instead of a standard computer monitor, much like the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amiga]]. the operating system for the Tian Yan is tailored for use with a television display. The '''Tianlong GX-3''' is a more robust machine marketed for business. The '''Tiansheng GX-4''' with slightly less memory and processor speeds that vary between 400MHz and 600MHz marketed for multimedia users. All desktop units support VGA and television video output. ==Sinomanic model comparison table== Prices of desktop models do not include [[Computer display|display]]s. {| class="wikitable" |- bgcolor="#CCCCCC" !

However, the use of the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] instruction set allowed them to correct many of their compatibility issues.<ref>[http://news.sanhaostreet.com/NewsData//2007/2/20072292793671.shtml 仅售1999元！龙芯笔记本预计下周开卖！-整机_笔记本__新品<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Versions of Debian Linux and Windows CE will be available for the units that ship initially. But because these operating systems cannot be optimized for Loongson's unique RISC instruction set, Sinomanic has continued development on their own second generation [[microkernel]] operating system codenamed '''Future Alpha'''. Future Alpha has apparently been customized for compatibility with the [[32-bit]] Loongson I (Longxin) processor. And Sinomanic recently tested an updated version of Future Alpha, for the [[64-bit]] Loongson II microprocessor. The company said that the 64-bit version of their Future Alpha operating system had successfully passed testing on January 19, 2007.<ref>[http://www.trustedreviews.com/notebooks/review/2006/09/28/Intel-Classmate-PC-EXCLUSIVE/p2 Intel Classmate PC – EXCLUSIVE – TrustedReviews<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/02/08/2323816.htm Sinomanic's Low-cost PC Sales Target Questioned<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In a press release dated 3 March 2007, Sinomanic demonstrated a custom version of Debian Linux running on the Tian Yan GX-2 their rural computer.

After [[authentication]], this file is granted to a user for data traffic protection by the [[key distribution center]] (KDC) subsystem of authentication services like [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]. The TGT file contains the [[session key]], its expiration date, and the user's [[IP address]], which protects the user from [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.
