"The free lunch is over: A fundamental turn toward concurrency in software," Dr. Dobb's Journal, 30(3), http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm.</ref> from [[Herb Sutter]] published in 2005. It stated that [[microprocessor]] serial processing speed is reaching a physical limit, which leads to two main consequences: * processor manufactures will focus on products that better support [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] (such as multi-core processors), and * software developers will be forced to develop massively [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] programs as a way to better use such processors. Despite these facts, information systems are still being developed in a more serial fashion. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} ==References== <div class="references-small"> <references/> </div> {{DEFAULTSORT:Free Lunch Is Over}} [[Category:Software engineering papers]] [[Category:2005 works]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37299</id> <title>The Future and You</title> <text>{{Cleanup-laundry|date=June 2009}} {{Infobox Podcast | title = The Future and You | image = | caption = | host = Stephen Euin Cobb | url = [http://www.thefutureandyou.com/ www.thefutureandyou.com] | rss = [http://www.thefutureandyou.libsyn.com/ www.thefutureandyou.libsyn.com] | status = weekly | length = between 30 and 60 minutes | began = December 15, 2005 | genre = Futurism }} '''''The Future and You''''' is a [[podcast]] <ref>{{cite web |title=Lifeboat Foundation list of advisory boardmembers |url=http://lifeboat.com/ex/boards}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web |title=The Future And You |url=http://www.thefutureandyou.com/}}</ref> hosted by [[Stephen Euin Cobb]] <ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Stephen Euin Cobb at the Lifeboat Foundation |url=http://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.stephen.euin.cobb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DragconCon's listing of past author guests (short bio of Stephen Euin Cobb)|url=http://www.dragoncon.org/dc_past_guests.php#B}}</ref> and teamed <ref>{{cite web |title=List of staff at Jim Baen's Universe Magazine |url=http://www.baens-universe.com/authors/Jim_Baen's_Universe!_staff}}</ref> with '''''[[Jim Baen's Universe]]''' Magazine'' <ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Baen's Universe Magazine's listing of articles Stephen Euin Cobb has written for it |url=http://www.baens-universe.com/authors/Stephen_Euin_Cobb/}}</ref> (the online magazine of SF&F from [[Baen Books]]).
