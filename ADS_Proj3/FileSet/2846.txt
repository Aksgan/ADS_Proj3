MechMania contests always have prizes associated with them (along with participation novelties such as t-shirts) provided by the sponsoring company. For example, 2006 had: * First place $375 ($125/person) * Second place $225 ($75/person) * Third place $150 ($50/person) As well as stupendous '''''plush dolphins''''' (see MechMania XII's story) for winners of the arena match. iPods have also been given away for MechMania X. ==External links== *[http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference ACM@UIUC Annual Reflections Projections Conference] [[Category:Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Category:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23893</id> <title>Mechanical filter</title> <text>[[File:Kokusai mechanical filter.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=photograph|'''Figure 1.''' A mechanical filter made by the Kokusai Electric Company intended for selecting the narrow {{nowrap|2 kHz}} bandwidth signals in [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] radio receivers. It operates at {{nowrap|455 kHz}}, a common [[intermediate frequency|IF]] for these receivers, and is dimensioned {{nowrap|45×15×15 mm}} ({{nowrap|{{frac|1|3|4}}×{{frac|7|12}}×{{frac|7|12}} in}}).]] A '''mechanical filter''' is a [[filter (signal processing)|signal processing filter]] usually used in place of an [[electronic filter]] at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]]. Its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter: to pass a range of signal frequencies, but to block others. The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal. At the input and output of the filter there are [[transducer]]s which convert the electrical signal into, and then back from, these mechanical vibrations. The components of a mechanical filter are all directly analogous to the various elements found in electrical circuits. The mechanical elements obey mathematical functions which are identical to their corresponding electrical elements. This makes it possible to apply electrical network analysis and filter design methods to mechanical filters. Electrical theory has developed a large library of mathematical forms that produce useful filter [[linear filter#Frequency response|frequency responses]] and the mechanical filter designer is able to make direct use of these. It is only necessary to set the mechanical components to appropriate values to produce a filter with an identical response to the electrical counterpart. [[Steel]] and [[nickel]]–[[iron]] alloys are common materials for mechanical filter components; nickel is sometimes used for the input and output couplings. Resonators in the filter made from these materials need to be machined to precisely adjust their [[resonance frequency]] before final assembly. While the meaning of ''mechanical filter'' in this article is one that is used in an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] role, it is fully possible to use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves (which are also essentially mechanical) directly. For example, filtering of audio frequency response in the design of [[loudspeaker enclosure|loudspeaker cabinets]] can be achieved with mechanical components. In the electrical application, in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts, transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains. There are a wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters, a representative selection of which are presented in this article. The theory of mechanical filters was first applied to improving the mechanical parts of [[phonograph]]s in the 1920s. By the 1950s mechanical filters were being manufactured as self-contained components for applications in radio transmitters and high-end receivers. The high "quality factor", ''[[Q factor|Q]]'', that mechanical resonators can attain, far higher than that of an all-electrical [[RLC circuit#Q factor|LC circuit]], made possible the construction of mechanical filters with excellent [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]]. Good selectivity, being important in radio receivers, made such filters highly attractive. Contemporary researchers are working on microelectromechanical filters, the mechanical devices corresponding to electronic integrated circuits. ==Elements== The elements of a [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] linear electrical network consist of [[inductor]]s, [[capacitor]]s and [[resistor]]s which have the properties of [[inductance]], elastance (inverse [[capacitance]]) and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, [[mass]], [[stiffness]] and [[damping]]. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements are used in the body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic element]]s. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.<ref name="Darlington, p.7">Darlington, p.7.</ref> The mechanical counterparts of [[voltage]] and [[electric current]] in this type of analysis are, respectively, [[force]] (''F'') and [[velocity]] (''v'') and represent the signal waveforms. From this, a [[mechanical impedance]] can be defined in terms of the imaginary [[angular frequency]], ''jω'', which entirely follows the electrical analogy.<ref>Norton, pp.1–2.</ref><ref>Talbot-Smith, pp.1.85,1.86.</ref> {|class="wikitable" width=702px !Mechanical element !!

Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the [[mobility analogy]],<ref group=n>The impedance analogy is the more common approach,(Gatti & Ferrari, pp.630–632) but amongst those using the mobility analogy is [[Rockwell Collins]] Inc, a principal manufacturer of mechanical filters.

This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, ''M'' → ''C'', ''S'' → 1/''L'', ''D'' → ''G'' where ''G'' is [[electrical conductance]], the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the [[dual impedance]] forms whereby series elements
