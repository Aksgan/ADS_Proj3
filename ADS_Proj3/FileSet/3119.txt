of categories of minerals, plants, or animals, and we know that different human cultures classify natural realities that surround them in a completely analogous fashion" (Molino 2000, p.168). The term was brought into contemporary philosophy by [[W. V. Quine]] in his essay "Natural Kinds", where any set of objects forms a kind only if (and perhaps if) it is "projectable", meaning judgments made about some members of that [[set (mathematics)|set]] can plausibly be extended by scientific [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] to other members. Hence "[[raven]]" and "[[black]]" are natural kind terms, because any black raven constitutes at least some evidence that all ravens are black. But "nonblack" and "nonraven" are not, because a nonblack nonraven (say, a [[red herring]]) is ''not'' evidence that all nonblack things are nonravens.<ref>http://web.telia.com/~u85903393/jbild/albino.jpg</ref> [[Nelson Goodman]]'s problem predicate "[[grue (color)|grue]]", meaning "observed before 1 January 2050 and blue ''or'' observed after 1 January 2050 and green", turns out to be inappropriate for science because it does not denote a natural kind. Quine argued that kind-hood was logically primitive: it could not be reduced non-trivially to any other relation among individuals. [[Cultural artifact]]s are not generally considered natural kinds. As one author puts it, "they never stop changing, and terms that designate them constitute only what [[Wittgenstein]] called '[[family resemblance]] predicates'" (''ibid'', p.169). This point is more disputed; [[John McDowell]] has extensively argued that this opposition between "culture" and "nature" cannot be clearly formulated, and that in any case it ought to lead us to construing cultural products not as unnatural, but as, adopting [[Aristotle]]'s terminology, a kind of "second nature." == References == {{reflist}} *Molino, Jean (2000).

The theory is based on the conception of Polish professor [[Andrzej Bogusławski]]. The leading proponents of the theory are [[Anna Wierzbicka]] at [[Warsaw University]] and later at the [[Australian National University]] who originated the theory in the early 1970s (Wierzbicka 1972), and [[Cliff Goddard]] at Australia's [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] (Goddard & Wierzbicka 1994, 2002). Linguists of the NSM school rely on [[semantic primitives]] (or semantic primes) for analysis (that is, simple, indefinable, and universally lexicalized concepts) and reductive paraphrase (that is, breaking complex concepts down into simpler concepts). Research in the NSM approach deals extensively with language and [[cognition]], and language and [[culture]]. Key areas of research include [[lexical semantics]], [[grammatical semantics]], [[phraseology]] and [[pragmatics]], as well as [[cross-cultural communication]]. Languages studied in the NSM-framework include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]] and [[East Cree]]<ref> "The natural semantic metalanguage approach", in Bernd Heine and Heiko Narrog (eds.)
