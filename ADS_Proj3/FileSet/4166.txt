"spam support"; That means that when a network operation provides any services to the identified spammers, the resources involved were listed. For instance, part of an ISP's network may have been listed in SPEWS for providing [[Domain Name System|DNS]] service to a [[Internet domain|domain]] mentioned in a piece of [[e-mail spam]], even if the messages weren't sent from said provider's mail servers. === Listing data or evidence files === IP addresses listed in SPEWS are mentioned in "evidence files". Those are plain text files which upon inspection appear edited by hand, where those IP addresses along with the technical evidence backing the listing, is depicted. The contents of those evidence files may seem rather cryptic to readers who are not intimately familiar with the technical [[jargon]] of the Internet. == Criticism of SPEWS == {{refimprove|date=March 2007}} No one knows how many service providers use the SPEWS list to reject mail. === Contacting SPEWS === One common criticism is that there is no way to contact SPEWS. According to the SPEWS FAQ: "Q41: How does one contact SPEWS? A41: One does not..." Having no way to contact SPEWS is seen as a way for SPEWS to avoid having to deal with complaints—even if they are legitimate—and to be immune from many consequences of mistakes, bad policies, or other problems. This caused SPEWS itself to be listed on some other DNSBLs such as those maintained at rfc-ignorant.org. === Criticism === SPEWS critics claim it blocks sites and does so for reasons they consider unfair. Critics argue that an ordinary customer of an ISP should not be held responsible for the actions of other customers of that ISP. === Counter argument === Supporters respond that SPEWS is a list of ''ISPs'' with spam problems. It is the ISP that's listed, not the customers. This is often argued with an analogy of pizza delivery companies who will not deliver to high crime areas. It's a bad situation for someone "stuck" in a bad area, but supporters argue that this also provides encouragement for a good citizen to unstick themselves and move to an ISP without a spam problem. The bad ISP loses revenue and the good ISP gets more customers, further encouraging bad ISPs to clean up. Supporters of SPEWS often point to the claim that SPEWS "blocks" email from sites as a misconception. A SPEWS listing only causes mail to be refused if the recipient of the email (or their ISP) chooses to block based on the SPEWS IP list. This counter argument has been criticized on the grounds that SPEWS is spreading information in a way conducive for blocking and in the knowledge that people are using it to block. According to this criticism, SPEWS should then be considered partly responsible for any blocking that happens and can be legitimately blamed if the blocking is inappropriate. In this view, the claims that lists such as SPEWS are advisory and that SPEWS itself does not block are seen as attempts to evade responsibility for SPEWS's own actions. == Delisting == According to the SPEWS FAQ, listings were removed when the spam or spam-support has stopped. Just as they did not solicit nominations for listings, the SPEWS operators did not solicit requests for delistings. There was no contact information published on the SPEWS Web site. There was no <tt>spews.org</tt> mail server, and the operators of SPEWS did not receive email under the SPEWS name. It is believed that the operators read certain [[Usenet]] newsgroups related to spam and email abuse. However, no poster has claimed to be a SPEWS operator and no regular of the newsgroups claims to know their identity. By the accounts of many of those regulars, SPEWS can detect automatically when such support stops, but this was not supported by any information in the SPEWS FAQ. ==See also== * [[News.admin.net-abuse.email]] (NANAE) ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.spews.org SPEWS.org] (down since October 2007) * [http://www.apews.org/ APEWS.org] === FAQ links === * [http://www.amray.net/nanaefaq.html First Post To NANAE Newsgroup] * [http://members.aol.com/emailfaq/mungfaq.html Address munging FAQ] * [http://www.spamfaq.net/terminology.shtml List of terms found in NANAE] * [http://www.killfile.org/faqs/cancel.html Dave the Resurrector FAQ]<br>(Sometimes posts mysteriously disappear from NANAE.

The network is composed by several supercomputers distributed over Spain. This institution tries to provide the computing resources needed by researchers in [[Spain]] and [[Europe]]. Nowadays, the network comprises seven supercomputers: * [[Altamira Supercomputer|Altamira]] in [[IFCA]], ([[University of Cantabria]], [[Cantabria]]). * [[CesarAugusta]] in [[University of Zaragoza]], ([[Zaragoza]]). * [[LaPalma]] in [[IAC]], ([[Canarias]]). * [[Magerit]] in [[CeSViMa]], ([[Technical University of Madrid]], [[Madrid]]). * [[MareNostrum]] in [[Barcelona Supercomputing Center | BSC]], ([[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], [[Barcelona]]). * [[Picasso (supercomputer)|Picasso]] in [[University of Malaga]], ([[Malaga]]). * [[Tirant]] in [[University of Valencia]], ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]). * [[Atlante (supercomputer)|Atlante]] in [[ITC]], ([[Canarias]]) All supercomputers are clones with different number of JS20 or JS21 blades. == History == Spanish Supercomputing Network was created in March, [[2007]] to increase the needs of computing resources in Spain. To achieve this, [[Magerit]] and [[MareNostrum]] supercomputers were upgraded and the old nodes from [[MareNostrum]] supercomputer were used to create five nodes ([[Altamira (supercomputer)|Altamira]], [[CesarAugusta]], [[LaPalma]], [[Picasso (supercomputer)|Picasso]], [[Tirant]]) of the network. In [[2009]] [[Atlante (supercomputer)|Atlante]] supercomputer joined the network. The software of the supercomputers was upgraded to the same level. == Use of the resources == An Access Committee (a group of 44 researchers who assess the importance of each project) controls the access to the computing resources: *Every researcher who wants to use the network must send a project to the Access Committee *All projects are evaluated by the access committee. *The best projects are accepted. The committee assigns several resources of one of the supercomputers during 4 months. If one project needs more computing resources, the leader of
