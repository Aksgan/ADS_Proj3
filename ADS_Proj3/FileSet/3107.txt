respectively). This book gives insight into the day to day working of a top scientific laboratory with no embellishment - both the excitement and thrill of discovery as well as the drudgery and politics can be found in ''Natural Obsessions''. The story is told by a masterful storyteller as the pressure to find these genes mounts and everyone is scrambling to be the first to announce this major discovery which could have gone to several laboratories. Of interest to students thinking of a career in science as well as practicing scientists who will relish in the honest portrayals and may personally know a number of the scientists who are now prominent in their fields. ==Commercial and critical reception== ''Natural Obsessions'' was reviewed favorably in the ''New York Times''<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Lax |title=A Wild Tribe in the Lab |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDB113AF933A25754C0A96E948260 |work=New York Times |date=1988-07-10 }}</ref> and ''Smithsonian'' magazine<ref>{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Kalfus |title=Natural Obsessions: The Search for the Oncogene |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5453305_ITM |work=Smithsonian |date=November 1988 }}</ref> in the months after its initial publication.

The main fields of research that compose these three branches are [[artificial neural networks]], [[evolutionary algorithms]], [[swarm intelligence]], [[artificial immune systems]], fractal geometry, [[artificial life]], [[DNA computing]], and [[quantum computing]], among others. Computational paradigms studied by natural computing are abstracted from natural phenomena as diverse as [[self-replication]], the functioning of the [[brain]], [[Darwinian evolution]], [[group behavior]], the [[immune system]], the defining properties of life forms, [[cell membranes]], and [[morphogenesis]]. Besides traditional [[electronic hardware]], these computational paradigms can be implemented on alternative physical media such as biomolecules (DNA, RNA), or trapped-ion [[#Quantum computing|quantum computing]] devices. Dually, one can view processes occurring in nature as information processing. Such processes include [[self-assembly]], [[developmental process]]es, [[gene regulation]] networks, [[protein-protein interaction]] networks, biological transport ([[active transport]], [[passive transport]]) networks, and [[gene assembly]] in [[unicellular organism]]s. Efforts to understand biological systems also include engineering of semi-synthetic organisms, and understanding the universe itself from the point of view of information processing. Indeed, the idea was even advanced that information is more fundamental than matter or energy. The Zuse-Fredkin thesis, dating back to the 1960s, states that the entire universe is a huge [[cellular automaton]] which continuously updates its rules.<ref name="Fredkin90">Fredkin, F. Digital mechanics: An informational process based on reversible universal CA. Physica D 45 (1990) 254-270</ref><ref name="Zuse67">Zuse, K. Rechnender Raum. Elektronische Datenverarbeitung 8 (1967) 336-344</ref> Recently it has been suggested that the whole universe is a [[quantum computer]] that computes its own behaviour.<ref name="Lloyd06>Lloyd, S. Programming the Universe: A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes on the Cosmos. Knopf, 2006</ref> == Nature-inspired models of computation == The most established "classical" nature-inspired models of computation are cellular automata, neural computation, and evolutionary computation. More recent computational systems abstracted from natural processes include swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, membrane computing, and amorphous computing. In fact, all major methods and algorithms are nature-inspired [[metaheuristic]] algorithms<ref name="Yang08">Yang, X.-S., Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, Luniver Press, (2008).</ref> including cellular automata, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence and others.

Y., Handbook of Bioinspired Algorithms and Applications, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2005.</ref> <ref name="de Castro"> de Castro, L. N., Fundamentals of Natural Computing: Basic Concepts, Algorithms, and Applications, CRC Press, 2006.</ref> === Cellular automata === : ''Further information: [[Cellular automaton]]'' A cellular automaton is a [[dynamical system]] consisting of a two-dimensional [[grid]] of cells. Space and time are discrete and each of the cells can be in a finite number of [[state (computer science)|states]]. The cellular automaton updates the states of its cells synchronously according to the transition rules given ''[[a priori]]''. The next state of a cell is computed by a transition rule and it depends only on its current state and the states of its neighbors. [[Conway's game of life]] is one of the best-known examples of cellular automata, shown to be [[Turing completeness|computationally universal]]. Cellular automata have been applied to modelling a variety of phenomena such as communication, growth, reproduction, competition, evolution and other physical and biological processes. === Neural computation === : ''Further information: [[Neural computation]]'' Neural computation is the field of research that emerged from the comparison between [[computer|computing machines]] and the human [[nervous system]].<ref name="Neumann58">von Neumann, J. The Computer and the Brain. Yale University Press, 1958</ref> This field aims both to understand how the '''[[brain]]''' of [[living organisms]] works ([[brain theory]] or [[computational neuroscience]]), and to design efficient algorithms based on the principles of how the human brain processes information (Artificial Neural Networks, ANN <ref name="Arbib03">Arbib, M., editor. The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks. MIT Press, 2003.</ref>). An [[artificial neural network]] is a network of [[artificial neurons]].<ref name="Rojas96">Rojas, R. Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction.
