He wrote primarily in [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. Leibniz occupies a prominent place in the [[history of mathematics]] and the [[history of philosophy]]. He developed the [[infinitesimal calculus]] independently of [[Sir Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton]], and [[Leibniz's notation|Leibniz's mathematical notation]] has been widely used ever since it was published. He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of [[Calculator#The_19th_century|mechanical calculators]]. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to [[Pascal's calculator]], he was the first to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]] in 1685<ref>[[#SMITH|David Smith]], p.173-181 (1929)</ref> and invented the [[Leibniz wheel]], used in the [[arithmometer]], the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the [[binary number system]], which is at the foundation of virtually all [[digital computer]]s. In philosophy, Leibniz is mostly noted for his optimism, ''e.g.'' his conclusion that our [[Universe]] is, in a restricted sense, the best possible one that a [[God]] could have created. Leibniz, along with [[René Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], was one of the three great 17th century advocates of [[rationalism]]. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]], but his philosophy also looks back to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence. Leibniz made major contributions to [[physics]] and [[technology]], and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[geology]], [[probability theory]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], and [[information science]]. He wrote works on [[politics]], [[law]], [[ethics]], [[theology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], and [[philology]]. Leibniz's contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various [[learned journal]]s, in tens of thousands of letters, and in unpublished manuscripts. As of 2010, there is no complete gathering of the writings of Leibniz.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |authorlink= |coauthors=Walter Kaufmann |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-13-158591-6 }}</ref> The collection of manuscript papers of Leibniz at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek – Niedersächische Landesbibliothek were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007.<ref name=mow>{{cite web|title= Letters from and to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz within the collection of manuscript papers of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22464&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2008-05-16 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-15}}</ref> ==Biography== ===Early life=== {{Refimprove|date=November 2010}} Gottfried Leibniz was born on July 1, 1646 in [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]], to Friedrich Leibniz and Catherina Schmuck.
