husband’s future needs relative to those of the wife'' -''The wealth of the marriage'' The factors relevant for a determination of past contributions are -''The relative direct and indirect contributions of both parties'' -''The length of the marriage'' -''The relative contributions of both parties to the homemaking role''. The hierarchy of Fig 2 provides a structure that is used to decompose the task of predicting an outcome into 35 subtasks. Outputs of tasks further down the hierarchy are used as inputs into sub-tasks higher up the hierarchy. Each sub-task is treated as a separate and smaller data mining exercise. Twenty one solid arcs represent inferences performed with the use of rule sets. For example, the level of wealth of a marriage is determined by a rule, which uses the common pool value. By contrast, the fourteen dashed arcs establish inferences performed with the use of [[neural networks]]. These receive their name from the fact that they resemble a [[nervous system]] in the [[brain]]. They consist of many self – adjusting processing elements cooperating in a densely interconnected network. Each processing element generates a single output that is transmitted to the other processing element. The output signal of a processing element depends on the input to the processing element, i.e. each input is gated by a weighing factor that determines the amount of influence that the input will have on the output. The strength of the weighing factors is adjusted autonomously by the processing element as the data is processed.<ref>Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow, J., Split Up: An Intelligent Decision Support System Which Provides Advice Upon Property Division Following Divorce, International Journal of Law and Information Technology, Vol 6. No. 2, 1998, 190 – 213, p. 196,</ref> In Split_Up, the neural network is a [[statistics|statistical]] technique for learning the weights of each of the relevant attributes used in a percentage split determination of marital property. Hence the inputs to the neural network are '''contributions, future needs''' and '''wealth''', and the output the '''percentage split predicted'''.

Using back [[propagation]] the neural network learns the necessary pattern to recognize the prediction. It is trained by repeatedly exposing it to examples of the problem and learning the significance (weights) of the input [[node]]s.<ref>Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow, J., Split Up: An Intelligent Decision Support System Which Provides Advice Upon Property Division Following Divorce, International Journal of Law and Information Technology, Vol 6. No. 2, 1998, 190 – 213,p.196</ref> The neural network used by Split_up is said to generalise well if the output of the network is correct (or nearly correct) for examples not seen during training, which classifies it as an [[intelligent system]].<ref>Nolan, J.R. and Zeleznikow, J., Using soft computing to build real world intelligent decision support systems in uncertain domains, Decision Support Systems, 31 (2001) 263 – 285, p. 274</ref> ===Toulmin Argument Structure=== Since the manner in which these weights are learned is primarily statistical, [[domain knowledge]] of legal rules and principles is not modelled directly. However, explanations for a legal conclusion in a domain as discretionary as the determining the distribution of property following divorce, are at least as important as the conclusion reached. Hence the creators of Split_Up used Toulmin Argument structures, to provide independent explanations of the conclusions reached.<ref>Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow,J., The Split_Up system: Integrating neural networks and rule-based reasoning in the legal domain, p.189</ref> These operate on the basis that every argument makes an assertion based on some data. The assertion of the argument stands as the claim of the argument. Since knowing the data and the claim, does not necessarily mean that the claim follows from the data, a mechanism is required to justify the claim in the light of the data. The justification is known as the warrant. The backing of an argument supports the validity of the warrant. In the legal domain, this is typically a reference to a statute or a precedent.

It is noteworthy, though, that an argument’s warrant is reproduced as an explanation regardless of the claim values used. This lack of claim - sensitivity must be overcome by the different users, i.e.the judge, the representatives for the wife and the representatives for the husband, each of whom is encouraged to use the system to prepare their cases, but not to rely exclusively on its outcome. ==References== {{Ibid|date=July 2010}} <!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} ==External links== * http://www.aaai.org/Papers/IAAI/1998/IAAI98-020.pdf * http://www.buscalegis.ufsc.br/revistas/files/journals/2/articles/6675/public/6675-6674-1-PB.pdf * http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/2/190 *http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V8S-42YFB2T-8&_user=809099&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1079494360&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000043939&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=809099&md5=8490a5290c887383f6ba72a9f89aa47c *http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/HICSS.1998.653106 *http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=323706.323799 * Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow, J. 2005.
