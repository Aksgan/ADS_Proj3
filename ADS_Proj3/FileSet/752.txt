this tradeoff between security and usability looked to develop a password system that utilized easily remembered personal facts and encouraged user participation. This line of research resulted in the concept of the associative password, a password system based on [[Sensory cue|user selected cues]] and responses <ref>(Smith, 1987)</ref>. This concept of associative passwords was extended to a pre-specified set of questions and answers that users would be expected to know and easily recall <ref>(Zviran and Haga, 1990a, p.723)</ref>. ==Cognitive questions== At the core of a cognitive password system lies the questions. These questions were designed to be more memorable than the standard username/password authentication method. As such, a measure of the strength of a cognitive password is the memorability/guessability ratio <ref>(Bunnell et. al, 1997, p. 631)</ref>. ===Question Development=== Questions developed for cognitive password systems are classified as being either fact or opinion based. Fact based question are questions with answers that are considered independent of an individuals feelings, such as "What is the name of the high school you attended?". Opinion based questions are the opposite, and as the name implies, have answers based on personal opinions such as, "What is your favorite color?" <ref name="zh1990a724"/>. Later research developed a set of criteria for question selection which included generalized answerability, number of potential answers, and generalized lack of ambiguity. The first criteria suggested that questions should be answerable by all (i.e. not asking "When did you purchase your first home?" because not all users may have purchased homes). The second criteria recommended selecting questions with a sufficiently large set of potential answers (i.e. not asking "How many children do you have?" because a majority of people would answer 0, 1 or 2). The final criteria looked for questions that were as unambiguous as possible (i.e. not asking "How many family members do you have?" as there may be some confusion as to who would be included in that count)<ref>(Bunnell et. al, 1997, p. 633)</ref>. ===Memorability vs. guessability=== A user's ability to correctly recall their password is expected to decrease as time progresses<ref>(Brown et al., 2004, p. 642)</ref>. However, the memorability of cognitive passwords remain relatively stable over time, with recall rates significantly higher than traditional passwords<ref name="bea1997635">(Bunnell et. al, 1997, p. 635)</ref><ref>(Zviran and Haga, 1990a, p.728)</ref>. When fact and opinion-based questions are compared, the fact-based questions are more likely to be correctly remembered than opinion-based questions, but still far more likely than traditional passwords<ref name="bea1997635"/>. Cognitive questions, with a group averaged as a whole, show relatively high guessability, much higher than traditional passwords but when analyzed individually, certain questions have been shown to have acceptable memorability/guessability ratios <ref name="bea1997635"/>. ==Examples== The following are some typical cognitive password questions: * What is your mother’s maiden name? * Who is your favorite superhero? * What is your dog’s name? * What is your car's name? * What is your favorite movie? * What city were you born in? * What is your [[favorite color]]? ==References== {{reflist}} ==Works cited== *{{Citation|last = Brown|first = Alan S.|last2 = al|first2 = et.|title = Generating and Remembering Passwords|journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume = 18|issue = 6|pages = 641–651|year = 2004}} *{{Citation|last = Bunnell|first = Julie|last2 = al|first2 = et.|title = Cognitive, associative and conventional passwords: Recall and guessing rates|journal = Computers & Security|volume = 16|issue = 7|pages = 629–641|year = 1997}} *{{Citation|last = Smith|first = Sidney L.|title = Authenticating Users by Word Association|journal = Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 135–138|year = 1987}} *{{Citation|last = Zviran|first = Moshe|last2 = Haga|first2 = William J.|title = Cognitive passwords: The key to easy access control|journal = Computers & Security|volume = 9|issue = 8|pages = 723–736|year = 1990a}} *{{Citation|last = Zviran|first = Moshe|last2 = Haga|first2 = William J.|title = Password Security: An Empirical Study|journal = Journal of Management Information Systems|volume = 15|issue = 4|pages = 161–185|year = 1999}} *{{Citation|last = Zviran|first = Moshe|last2 = Elrich|first2 = Zippy|title = Identification and Authentication: Technology and Implementation Issues|journal = Communications of the Association for Information Systems|volume = 17|issue = 4|pages = 90–105|year = 2006}} ==External links== * [http://www.steam.ualberta.ca/main/research_areas/vcpassword.htm Visual and Cognitive Password Authentication] {{DEFAULTSORT:Cognitive Password}} [[Category:Password authentication]] [[ms:Kata laluan kognitif]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6798</id> <title>Colatitude</title> <text>In [[spherical coordinates]], '''colatitude''' is the [[complementary angle]] of the [[latitude]], i.e. the difference between 90° and the latitude. ==Astronomical use== The colatitude is useful in [[astronomy]] because it refers to the [[zenith distance]] of the [[celestial pole]]s. For example, at [[42nd parallel north|latitude 42&deg;N]], [[Polaris]] (approximately on the North celestial pole) has an [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of 42°, so the distance from the [[zenith]] (overhead point) to Polaris is 90 - 42 = 48°. Adding the declination of a star to the observer's colatitude gives the maximum latitude of that star (its angle from the [[horizon]] at [[culmination]] or upper transit). For example, if [[Alpha Centauri]] is seen with a latitude of 72° north (108° south) and its declination is known (60°S), then it can be determined that the observer's colatitude is 108 - 60 = 48 (i.e. their latitude is 90 - 48 = 42°S). Stars whose declinations exceed the observer's colatitude are called [[circumpolar]] because they will never set as seen from that latitude. If an object's declination is further south on the celestial sphere than the value of the colatitude, then it will never be seen from that location. For example, Alpha Centauri will always be visible at night from [[Perth, Western Australia]] because the colatitude is 90 - 32 = 58, and 60 is greater than 58; on the other hand, the star will never rise in [[Juneau]] because its declination of -60° is less than -32° (the negation of Juneau's colatitude).
