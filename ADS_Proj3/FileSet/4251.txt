locale, then the locale is '''spatial''', or said to have enough points. Finally, one can verify that for every space ''X'', &Omega;(''X'') is spatial and for every locale ''L'', pt(''L'') is sober. Hence, it follows that the above adjunction of '''Top''' and '''Loc''' restricts to an equivalence of the full subcategories '''Sob''' of sober spaces and '''SLoc''' of spatial locales. This main result is completed by the observation that for the functor pt o &Omega;, sending each space to the points of its open set lattice is right adjoint to the [[inclusion functor]] from '''Sob''' to '''Top'''. For a space ''X'', pt(&Omega;(''X'')) is called its '''soberification'''. The case of the functor &Omega; o pt is symmetric but a special name for this operation is not commonly used. ==References== A monograph available free online: * Burris, Stanley N., and H.P.

He approached Andrew Stuart, a UK-based puzzle maker and programmer, to make the puzzle. Their collaboration settled how the clues would be determined and finalized the rules. The first puzzle was presented at the [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] in February 2008. A daily puzzle has been published at their website since 24 November 2008. The puzzle has appeared in ''[[S체ddeutsche Zeitung]]'' since March 2010, and in the Saturday edition of ''Die Rheinpfalz'' since August 2010. An [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] app was released in July 2009, containing hundreds of puzzles in four difficulty levels.<ref>[http://www.appbite.com/str8ts-iphone-game-review/ Str8ts iPhone App Review].

Each compartment, vertically or horizontally, must contain a ''straight'' - a set of consecutive numbers, but in any order. For example: 7, 6, 4, 5 is valid, but 1, 3, 8, 7 is not. Like sodoku, the solver must fill the remaining white cells with numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to n in puzzles with N cells per side) such that each row and column contains unique digits. Whereas Sudoku has the additional constraint of 3x3 ''boxes'', in Str8ts rows and columns are divided by additional clues are set in some of the black cells - these numbers remove that digit as an option in the row and column. Such digits do not form part of any straight. There are a number of variants to the basic game, including Symmetric Str8ts, Asymmetric Str8ts, Mini-Str8ts, and Transformations. == Grading == As Str8ts belongs to the same class of puzzles as [[Sudoku]] the puzzle can demonstrate a wide spectrum of relative difficulty. The grade is determined by a combination of ''opportunities to solve'' at each stage and the difficulty of the strategy that grants each solution. An easier puzzle will have many places where a logical deduction can place a solution or eliminate a candidate number. When the whole puzzle is assessed in this way, plus some heuristics, a score can be determined. Over a large number of puzzles (>10,000) a bell curve of scores can be produced. This can be quartiled to group puzzles into specific grades.<ref>[http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku_Creation_and_Grading.pdf Sudoku Creation and Grading]. ''SudokuWiki.org''.
