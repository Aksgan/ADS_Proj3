suffer from loss of precision. Then use this identity to calculate the other root. Since no subtraction is involved, no loss of precision occurs. Applying this algorithm to our problem, and using 10-digit floating-point arithmetic, the solution of greater magnitude, as before, is <math>x_1 = -200.00000005.</math> The other solution is then :<math> x_2 = c / (-200.00000005) = 0.000000075,</math> which is accurate.

He is presented firstly being in service of the Metabaron (the Nameless), who asks [[Tonto (Metabarons)|Tonto]] to narrate to him of his master's history. Tonto who has been served the Metabarons for decades, unlike Lothar who is relatively new in the Metabaron's ownership, tells the saga to him, being thus the main narrator of the comic book series. During the [[frame story]] (outside of the narrative), Lothar loses his body and a new one is constructed for him. It is revealed in the process that he in fact is Steelhead, the Metabaron's grandfather, who returned to reclaim his office. The Metabaron however managed to erase his memory and transform him into a robot, serving him. Finally recovering his sense of self, if not his full memories, Steelhead, ridding of the mechanical control implants, wrestles again with Nameless, albeit he finally gives his life for good saving his nephew, and the entire Universe, with a [[kamikaze]] attack.

Lotus is most commonly known for the [[Lotus 1-2-3]] [[spreadsheet]] application, the first feature-heavy, user-friendly, reliable and [[WYSIWYG]]-enabled product to become widely available in the early days of the [[IBM PC]], when there was no [[Graphical user interface]]. Such a useful tool certainly helped to spread the adoption of the PC, both for administrative and scientific applications. Much later, in conjunction with [[Ray Ozzie]]'s [[Iris Associates]], Lotus also released a [[groupware]] and [[email]] system, [[Lotus Notes]]. IBM purchased the company in 1995 for $3.5 billion, primarily to acquire Lotus Notes and to establish a presence in the increasingly important [[client–server]] computing segment, which was rapidly making host-based products like IBM's [[IBM OfficeVision|OfficeVision]] obsolete.<ref>{{Citation| title=IBM takes fight to Microsoft with Lotus Symphony| first=John E.| last=Dunn| publisher=Techworld.com| date=18 September 2007| accessdate=2007-12-10| url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/18/IBM-takes-fight-to-Microsoft-with-Lotus-Symphony_1.html}}</ref> == History == Lotus was founded in 1982 by partners [[Mitch Kapor]] and [[Jonathan Sachs]] with backing from [[Sevin Rosen Funds|Ben Rosen]]. Lotus' first product was presentation software for the [[Apple II]] known as Lotus Executive Briefing System. Kapor founded Lotus after leaving his post as head of development at [[VisiCorp]] (the distributors of the [[Visicalc]] [[spreadsheet]]) and selling all his rights to the VisiPlot and VisiTrend products to VisiCorp. Shortly after Kapor left VisiCorp, he and Sachs produced an integrated spreadsheet and graphics program. Even though IBM and VisiCorp had a collaboration agreement whereby VisiCalc was being shipped simultaneously with the PC, Lotus had a clearly superior product. Lotus released [[Lotus 1-2-3]] on January 26, 1983. The name referred to the three ways the product could be used, as a spreadsheet, graphics package, and [[database manager]]. In fact, the latter two functions were less often used, nonetheless 1-2-3 was the most powerful spreadsheet program available. Sales were huge, turning Lotus into the largest independent software vendor in the world almost overnight. The business plan had called for $1 million in sales in the first year, but actual results were $54 million. In 1982 [[Jim Manzi]] came to Lotus as a management consultant, and became an employee four months later. In October 1984 he was named President, and in April 1986 he was named as [[CEO]], succeeding Kapor. In July of that same year he also became Chairman of the Board. [[Jim Manzi|Manzi]] would remain at the head of Lotus until 1995. ===Dominance=== As the popularity of the [[personal computer]] grew, Lotus quickly came to dominate the spreadsheet market. Lotus introduced other office products such as [[Ray Ozzie]]'s [[Lotus Symphony for DOS|Symphony]] in 1984 and the [[Lotus Jazz|Jazz]] office suite for the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer in 1985. Jazz did very poorly in the market. (In Guy Kawasaki's book ''The Macintosh Way,'' Lotus Jazz was described as being so bad, "even the people who pirated it returned it.") Also in 1985, Lotus bought [[Software Arts]] and discontinued the latter company's VisiCalc program. In the late 1980s, Lotus developed [[Lotus Magellan]], a file management and indexing utility. This period also saw the release of Manuscript, a word processor, [[Lotus Agenda]], an innovative personal information manager (PIM), which flopped, and [[Lotus Improv|Improv]], a groundbreaking modeling package for the [[NeXT]] platform. Improv also flopped, and none of these products made a significant impact on the market. ==="Look and feel" lawsuits=== Lotus was involved in a number of lawsuits, of which the most significant were the "[[look and feel]]" cases which started in 1987. Lotus sued Paperback Software and Mosaic for copyright infringement, false and misleading advertising, and unfair competition over their low-cost clones of 1-2-3, VP Planner and Twin, and sued [[Borland]] over its Quattro spreadsheet. This{{Fact|date=April 2008}} led [[Richard Stallman]], founder of the [[Free Software Foundation]], to found the [[League for Programming Freedom]] (LPF) and hold protests outside Lotus Development offices.
