Thus, the hybrid approach makes it easier to use multiple ontologies for integration in presence of the common vocabulary. ==See also== * [[Schema matching]] * [[Data Integration]] * [[Enterprise application integration]] * [[Enterprise Information Integration]] * [[Data mapping]] * [[Ontology mapping]] * [[Semantic Integration]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== *[http://sid.cps.unizar.es/OBSERVER/ OBSERVER home page] [[Category:Ontology (information science)]] [[Category:Data management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27285</id> <title>Ontology (information science)</title> <text>[[Image:Mason-ontology.png|thumb|320px|Example of an ontology visualized: the Mason-ontology.]] In [[computer science]] and [[information science]], an '''ontology''' is a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a [[Domain of discourse|domain]], and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to [[Reasoning|reason]] about the entities within that domain, and may be used to describe the domain. In theory, an ontology is a "formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation".<ref name="TRG93">T. Gruber (1993).

Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Semantic Web]], [[systems engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[biomedical informatics]], [[library science]], [[enterprise bookmarking]], and [[information architecture]] as a form of [[knowledge representation]] about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an [[enterprise architecture framework]]. ==Overview== The term ''[[ontology]]'' has its origin in [[philosophy]], and has been applied in many different ways. The word "ontology" comes from the Greek Ον (on), which literally means entity. The core meaning within [[computer science]] is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.<ref>L. M. Garshol (2004).

In both fields, one finds considerable work on problems of ontological relativity (e.g., [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]] in philosophy, [[John F. Sowa|Sowa]] and [[Nicola Guarino|Guarino]] in computer science),<ref>J. F. Sowa. Top-level ontological categories. In ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 43 (November/December), 1995, pp. 669-85.</ref> and debates concerning whether a [[normative]] ontology is viable (e.g., debates over [[foundationalism]] in philosophy, debates over the [[Cyc]] project in AI). Differences between the two are largely matters of focus. Philosophers are less concerned with establishing fixed, controlled vocabularies than are researchers in computer science, while computer scientists are less involved in discussions of first principles (such as debating whether there are such things as [[fixed essences]], or whether entities must be ontologically more primary than processes). ==History== Historically, ontologies arise out of the branch of [[philosophy]] known as [[metaphysics]], which deals with the nature of reality – of what exists. This fundamental branch is concerned with analyzing various types or modes of existence, often with special attention to the relations between [[particular]]s and [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], between [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]], and between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. The traditional goal of ontological inquiry in particular is to divide the world "at its joints", to discover those fundamental categories, or kinds, into which the world’s objects naturally fall.<ref name="PCB94">P. C. Benjamin et al. (1994). [http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef5.pdf ''IDEF5 Method Report'']. Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.</ref> During the second half of the 20th century, philosophers extensively debated the possible methods or approaches to building ontologies, without actually ''building'' any very elaborate ontologies themselves. By contrast, computer scientists were building some large and robust ontologies (such as [[WordNet]] and [[Cyc]]) with comparatively little debate over ''how'' they were built. Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) have recognized that capturing knowledge is the key to building large and powerful AI systems. AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as [[computational model]]s that enable certain kinds of [[automated reasoning]]. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term ''ontology'' to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge systems. Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.<ref name ="TG08">T. Gruber (2008).

Gruber "introduced the term to mean a specification of a conceptualization. That is "an ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy".<ref name="TRG01">T.
