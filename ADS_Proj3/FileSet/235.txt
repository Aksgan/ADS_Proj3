Martin Company]]. Other private sector efforts to master the understanding of gravitation was the creation of the Institute for Field Physics, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], in 1956 by Gravity Research Foundation trustee, Agnew H. Bahnson. Military support for anti-gravity projects was terminated by the [[Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973, which restricted [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] spending to only the areas of scientific research with explicit military applications. The Mansfield Amendment was passed specifically to end long-running projects that had little to show for their efforts. ====Negative mass==== Under general relativity, gravity is the result of following a spatial geometry (change in the normal shape of space) caused by local mass-energy. This theory holds that it is the altered shape of space, deformed by massive objects, that causes 'gravity', which is actually a property of deformed space rather than being a true force. Although the equations cannot produce a "negative geometry" normally, it is possible to do so using a "negative mass". The same equations do not, of themselves, rule out the existence of negative mass. Both general relativity and Newtonian gravity appear to predict that negative mass would produce a repulsive gravitational field. In particular, Sir [[Hermann Bondi]] proposed in 1957 that negative gravitational mass, combined with negative inertial mass, would comply with the [[strong equivalence principle]] of general relativity theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy. Bondi's proof yielded singularity free solutions for the relativity equations.<ref name="Bondi">Bondi, H. (1957, July). Negative mass in general relativity. ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', '''29'''(3), 423-428.</ref> In July 1988, [[Robert L. Forward]] presented a paper at the AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE 24th Joint Propulsion Conference that proposed a Bondi negative gravitational mass propulsion system.<ref name= "Forward">Forward, R. L.

The force is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the two [[mass]]es and inversely proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the distance between the point masses: :<math>\mathbf{F_{12}} = G \frac{(-m_1) m_2}{r^2}\mathbf{r_{12}} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\mathbf{r_{21}} = \mathbf{-F_{21}},</math> where: *''<math>F_{12}</math>'' is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two point masses, *''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], *|''m''<sub>1</sub>| >0 is the (negative) mass of the first point mass, the minus is put out to show negative force, ''m''<sub>1</sub> is actually <0 *''m''<sub>2</sub> >0 is the mass of the second point mass, *''r'' is the distance between the two point masses. Bondi pointed out that a negative mass will fall toward (and not away from) "normal" matter, since although the gravitational force is repulsive, the negative mass (according to Newton's law, F=ma) responds by accelerating in the opposite of the direction of the force. Normal mass, on the other hand, will fall away from the negative matter. He noted that two identical masses, one positive and one negative, placed near each other will therefore self-accelerate in the direction of the line between them, with the negative mass chasing after the positive mass.<ref name="Bondi" /> Notice that because the negative mass acquires negative [[kinetic energy]], the total energy of the accelerating masses remains at zero. Forward pointed out that the self-acceleration effect is due to the negative inertial mass, and could be seen induced without the gravitational forces between the particles.<ref name="Forward" /> The [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, which describes all presently known forms of matter, does not include negative mass. Although cosmological [[dark matter]] may consist of particles outside the Standard Model whose nature is unknown, their mass is ostensibly known - since they were postulated from their gravitational effects on surrounding objects, which implies their mass is positive. (The proposed cosmological [[dark energy]], on the other hand, is more complicated, since according to general relativity the effects of both its energy density and its negative pressure contribute to its gravitational effect.) ====Fifth force==== Under general relativity any form of energy couples with spacetime to create the geometries that cause gravity. A longstanding question was whether or not these same equations applied to [[antimatter]]. The issue was considered solved in 1960 with the development of [[CPT symmetry]], which demonstrated that antimatter follows the same laws of physics as "normal" matter, and therefore has positive energy content and also causes (and reacts to) gravity like normal matter. For much of the later quarter of the 20th century, the physics community has been involved in an attempt to produce a [[unified field theory]], a single physical theory that explains the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Scientists have made progress in [[grand unification theory|unifying the three quantum forces]], but gravity has remained "the problem" in every attempt. This has not stopped any number of such attempts being made, however. Generally these attempts tried to "quantize gravity" by positing a particle, the [[graviton]], that carried gravity in the same way that [[photon]]s (light) carry electromagnetism. Simple attempts along this direction all failed, however, leading to more complex examples that attempted to account for these problems. Two of these, [[supersymmetry]] and the relativity related [[supergravity]], both required the existence of an extremely weak "fifth force" carried by a [[graviphoton]], which coupled together several "loose ends" in quantum field theory, in an organized manner. As a side effect, both theories also all but required that antimatter be affected by this fifth
