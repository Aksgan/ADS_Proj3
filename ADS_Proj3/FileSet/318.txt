Until 21 May 2001<ref>{{cite news | work = [[CNET Networks]] | title = Defaced-site archive retires | author = Robert Lemos | date = 2001-05-21 | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-258006.html }}</ref>, Attrition maintained the largest [[Mirror (computing)|mirror]] of defaced (or ''cracked'') websites available on the World Wide Web. The defacement mirror has since ceased updating. Often incorrectly described by journalists as a site for [[Hacker (computing)|hackers]], Attrition is actually a privately owned and operated hobby-site operated by Brian Martin with a variety of information available, including movie and music reviews, poetry, security tips covering topics like [[Computer forensics|forensics]], data theft, advisories, and incident response. The "Going Postal" section, some of the more interesting emails the staffers get are posted, sometimes with humorous responses by the staff, often at the expense of the recipients. Exploiting the ignorance of others is a common theme in attrition.org's dark humor throughout the website. One example of this involved the setup of Todd Shriber, who attempted to "hire" the attrition team to hack into his former university to change his grades. He was sacked from his job as a Republican communications director due to the incident. [https://www.hackinthebox.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2952 The attrition.org website was hacked and defaced itself in 2001], in reply to which, site owner Brian Martin was quoted as saying, in effect, he could not be held accountable to the same standards he held security companies accountable to, since he was not running a security service -- at least not at the time. Owner Brian Martin goes by various aliases on his website, including Jared, Jericho, Jared E. Richo, and security curmudgeon. [http://www.chillingeffects.org/protest/notice.cgi?NoticeID=153 In 2001 attrition.org was given a cease and desist order] by lawyers of MasterCard for supposedly posting distasteful parodies of the now-famous "Priceless" advertising campaign, which violated copyright law. The original parodies have since been removed from the website. Since updating of the defacement mirror has ceased, the staff has focused on the "Errata" section, which is devoted to pointing out inaccuracies, omissions and other problems with mainstream media related to computer security and hacking. Additionally, staff members publish opinion pieces such as "Security Rants" pointing out problems with the computer security industry. Attrition will frequently publish pages, or devote entire sections of the site, to topics the staff feel deserve extra attention. Examples include "Cisco: There is no fixed software for this issue," "The Open Source Vulnerability Database," "Security Advisories," "Negation," regarding John Vranesevich and [http://Antionline.com Antionline.com]; "Shame," regarding [[Carolyn Meinel]]. Attrition formerly hosted several [[electronic mailing list]]s relating to information security, such as InfoSec News. It also maintained the [[Data Loss Database]], which records the data breaches at companies.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | title = The Cybercriminal Inside | author = Andy Greenberg | date = 07-10-2007 | url = http://www.forbes.com/2007/07/10/computer-security-internal-biz-biztech-cx_ag_0710mcafee.html }}</ref> In addition to his involvement with DataLossDB.org, attrition.org founder Brian Martin is currently President of the [http://opensecurityfoundation.org Open Security Foundation], a non profit that seeks to monitor, report, and maintain historical archives of security flaws and incidents. ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://attrition.org Attrition] *[http://www.attrition.org/postal/z/033/0871.html Attrition's humorous "going postal" exchange with Todd Shriber] *[https://www.hackinthebox.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2952 Brian Martin speaks about Attrition defacement] *[http://www.chillingeffects.org/protest/notice.cgi?NoticeID=153 MasterCard Infringement by attrition.org] *[http://datalossdb.org DataLossDB.org] *[http://opensecurityfoundation.org Open Security Foundation] [[Category:Computer security organizations]] [[Category:Computing websites]] [[ja:Attrition.org]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2728</id> <title>Auction theory</title> <text>'''Auction theory''' is an applied branch of [[economics]] which deals with how people act in [[auction]] markets and researches the properties of auction markets. There are many possible designs (or sets of rules) for an auction and typical issues studied by auction theorists include the [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] of a given auction design, optimal and equilibrium bidding strategies, and revenue comparison. Auction theory is also used as a tool to inform the design of real-world auctions; most notably auctions for the privatisation of public-sector companies or the sale of licenses for use of the electromagnetic spectrum. ==General Idea== Auctions take many forms but always satisfy two conditions: '''(i)''' They may be used to sell any item and so are ''universal'', also '''(ii)''' The outcome of the auction does not depend on the identity of the bidders; i.e., auctions are ''anonymous''. Most auctions have the feature that participants submit ''bids'', amounts of money they are willing to pay. '''Standard''' auctions require that the winner of the auction is the participant with the highest bid. A '''nonstandard''' auction does not require this (e.g. a lottery). ==Types of auction== There are traditionally four types of auction that are used for the allocation of a single item: * [[First-price sealed-bid auctions]] in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying a price equal to the exact amount that he or she bid. * [[sealed second-price auction|Second-price sealed-bid auctions (Vickrey auctions)]] in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying a price equal to the exact amount of the ''second highest'' bid. * [[English auction|Open Ascending-bid auctions (English auctions)]] in which the price is steadily raised by the auctioneer with bidders dropping out once the price becomes too high. This continues until there remains only one bidder who wins the auction at the current price. * [[Dutch auction|Open Descending-bid auctions (Dutch auctions)]] in which the price starts at a level sufficiently high to deter all bidders
