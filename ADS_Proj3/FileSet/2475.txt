prohibitively expensive beyond a certain point. (This was the primary reason that speed advancements ceased, and popularity declined, for the [[SCSI]] parallel peripheral interface.) For this reason, high speed asynchronous [[serial port]]s are capable of higher bandwidth than parallel ports. (High speed synchronous serial ports suffer from the same skew problem as high speed parallel ports.) ==Wiring== The wiring of the cable is as follows (the two connectors are [[DB25]] males): {| |- | 2 || 15 |- | 3 || 13 |- | 4 || 12 |- | 5 || 10 |- | 6 || 11 |- | 17 || 17 |- | 25 || 25 |} Vice versa, pins 15-11 on the first connector are wired to 2-6 of the second connector. ==See also== * [[Parallel Line Internet Protocol]] (PLIP) * [[Direct cable connection]] * [[Serial console]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.nullmodem.com/LapLink.htm Pin descriptions at Nullmodem.Com] {{DEFAULTSORT:Laplink Cable}} [[Category:Computer hardware]] [[Category:Signal cables]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}} [[es:Cable paralelo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21155</id> <title>Lapis (programming language)</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Notability|date=September 2009}} '''Lapis''' is an [[object-oriented]] [[stack-based]] [[computer language]] whose [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], in its current form, is about 50 [[kilobytes]] in size.

Previously linked to another coolmax not associated with computer products --> A '''laptop/notebook cooler''', '''cooler pad''' or '''chill mat''' is an accessory for [[laptop]] computers that helps reduce their [[operating temperature]]. Normally used when the laptop's fan device is unable to sufficiently cool the laptop, a cooling pad may house active or passive cooling methods and rests beneath the laptop. Active coolers move air or liquid to direct heat away from the laptop quickly, while passive methods may rely on thermally conductive materials or increasing passive airflow. ==Active coolers== Many cooler pads support the use of a power adapter, they typically run on power drawn through one of the laptop's [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports. Many cooler pads therefore compensate with a built-in USB hub. Other features include card readers for various forms of media such as [[keydrive]]s, [[memory card]]s, and 2.5" Laptop [[hard disk drive]]s. Some of these "powered" coolers are designed to draw heat from the underside of the computer; others work in the opposite way by blowing cool air towards the machine. The fan speed is adjusted manually or automatically on certain models and on others stays at a fixed speed. The contribution of heat from the energy requirement of the cooler is very minimal impact as USB ports are limited to 2.5 watts of output power, whereas a laptop can easily consume 40 W of electrical power. ==Passive coolers== Typically, a conductive cooling pad allows for the cooling of a laptop without using any power. These "Pads" are normally filled with an organic salt compound that allows them to absorb the heat from the laptop <ref name=" USpatent 7327340">[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm&r=9&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=7324340&OS=7324340&RS=7324340 United States Patent 7,324,340]</ref>. They are good for a limited amount of time from around 6–8 hours of cooling. Other designs are simply a pad that elevates the laptop so that the fans in the laptop are allowed greater airflow. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Computer hardware cooling]] [[Category:Laptops]] {{compu-hardware-stub}} [[de:Notebook-Kühler]] [[et:Sülearvuti jahutus]] [[fr:Notebook cooler]] [[ko:노트북 냉각기]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21167</id> <title>Large Technical System</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} A '''Large Technical System''' (LTS) is a system or network of enormous proportions or complexity.

The principal operation in large eddy simulation is [[Filter (signal processing)|low-pass filtering]]. This operation is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations to eliminate small scales of the solution. This reduces the computational cost of the simulation. The governing equations are thus transformed, and the solution is a filtered velocity field. Which of the "small" length and time scales to eliminate are selected according to turbulence theory and available computational resources.<ref name="Pope_2000">{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Pope |title=[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521598869 Turbulent Flows] |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780521598866 }}</ref> Large eddy simulation resolves large scales of the flow field solution, allowing better fidelity than alternative approaches that do not resolve
