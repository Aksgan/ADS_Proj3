Security of National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems", dated 5 July 1990. On October 16, 2001, [[United States President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signed [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] [[Executive Order 13231|13231]], the Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Information Age, re-designating the '''National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee''' ([[NSTISSC]]) as the Committee on National Security Systems. The CNSS holds discussions of policy issues, sets national policy, directions, operational procedures, and guidance for the information systems operated by the U.S. Government, its contractors or agents that either contain classified information, involve intelligence activities, involve cryptographic activities related to national security, involve command and control of military forces, involve equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system(s), or are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] chairs the committee. Membership consists of representatives from 21 U.S. Government Departments and Agencies with voting privileges, to include the [[CIA]], [[DIA]], [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]], [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], [[FBI]], [[NSA]], and the [[National Security Council]], and all [[United States Military]] Services. Members not on the voting commitiee include the [[DISA]], [[NGA]], [[NIST]], and the [[NRO]]. The operating Agency for CNSS appears to be the [[National Security Agency]], Which serves as primary contact for public inquiries. ==Education certification== The CNSS defines several standards, which include standards on training in IT security. Current certifications include: * [[NSTISSI-4011]] National Training Standard for Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Professionals * [[CNSSI-4012]] National Information Assurance Training Standard for Senior Systems Managers * [[CNSSI-4013]] National Information Assurance Training Standard For System Administrators * [[CNSSI-4014]] Information Assurance Training Standard for Information Systems Security Officers * [[NSTISSI-4015]] National Training Standard for Systems Certifiers * [[CNSSI-4016]] National Information Assurance Training Standard For Risk Analysts == External links == * [http://www.cnss.gov/ CNSS official site] [[Category:United States government secrecy]] [[Category:Independent agencies of the United States government]] [[Category:Government agencies established in 2001]] [[Category:Computer security]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7005</id> <title>Common Berthing Mechanism</title> <text>The '''Common Berthing Mechanism''' (or CBM) is a hardware element used to connect all non-Russian pressurized modules of the [[International Space Station]]. [[File:Iss021e016414.jpg|thumb|European Space Agency astronaut Frank De Winne, Expedition 21 commander, works in the vestibule between the International Space Station's Harmony node and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) in preparation for the release of the HTV scheduled for Oct. 30, 2009.]] A Common Berthing Mechanism consists of two components: the Active Common Berthing Mechanism (ACBM) and the Passive Common Berthing Mechanism (PCBM).<ref name="cbm-tech">{{PDFlink|[http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/design_lib/ICES01-2435.ISS_CBM.pdf The Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) for International Space Station]|923 [[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 945909 bytes -->}}</ref> Once connected, the two sides of the CBM form a pressure tight seal. The CBM also features a hatch, which can be opened to reveal a 50 inch (127 cm) diameter passage for crew/cargo transfer. Since this passage is large enough to allow [[International Standard Payload Rack]]s to fit, payloads can be pre-configured in racks and transported to the station aboard the [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]]s, which use CBM ports. Once the hatches have been opened, electrical, data, and fluid lines can be manually connected through the CBM vestibule by the crew. The Common Berthing Mechanism was first used to connect the ''[[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]]'' and the [[Integrated Truss Structure#Z1 truss|Z1 truss]] of the International Space Station.<ref name="cbm-tech" /> The CBM is to be used as a berthing mechanism for the unmanned Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] (HTV). Future support spacecraft such as the [[Cygnus spacecraft|Cygnus]] resupply vehicle, and the [[SpaceX Dragon]] capsule are also designed to connect using a CBM. These spacecraft will feature a PCBM, and will be berthed to one of the station's open ACBMs using the station's robot arm.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Each CBM compatible module that connects to previously launched modules requires a PCBM to connect to an APCM.<ref name="cbm-tech" /> The three ISS connecting nodes feature four radial ACBM ports. ''Unity'' features two ACBM on the axial side, while ''[[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]]'' and ''[[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]]'' feature a PCBM on one axial side and an ACBM on the other axial side.<ref name="node2-design">{{cite book|title=SM98-110/254 International Space Station Node 2 - Structure Design Analysis and Static Test Definition|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1999ESASP.428..173G&db_key=AST&page_ind=1&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES|author=Gualtieri, N|coauthors=Rubino, S.; Itta, A.|isbn= 9290927127|page=174|publisher=European Space Agency}}</ref><ref name="node3-design">{{cite web|url=https://node.msfc.nasa.gov/geninfo/External/Node%203%20Description.pdf|title=Node 3 Description|publisher=NASA}}</ref> The ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]''' laboratory and the [[Japanese Pressurised Module]] both feature one PCBM and one ACBM.<ref name="sts-98-presskit">{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/Sts-98/index.htm|title=STS-98 Presskit|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2010-02-08|date=2001-02-07}}</ref><ref name="pm-cbm">{{cite web|url=http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/about/kibo/jpm/|title=Pressurized Module:About Kibo - Kibo Japanese Experimental Module|publisher=JAXA|accessdate=2010-02-08|date=2008-08-29}}</ref> ==References== <references/> [[Category:Spacecraft components]] [[Category:International Space Station components]] [[Category:Interfaces]] [[es:Common Berthing Mechanism]] [[fr:Common Berthing Mechanism]] [[it:Common Berthing Mechanism]] [[ru:Единый механизм пристыковки]] [[ja:共通結合機構]] [[vi:Common Berthing Mechanism]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7009</id> <title>Common Content</title> <text>The '''Common Content''' project attempts to gather links to as much [[open content]] as possible under the [[Creative Commons]] [[parametric license]] regime.
