Admirably, Paul Thagard has attempted to give a computationally detailed account of the kind of coherence involved in practical reasoning, claiming that it will help overcome problems in foundationalist approaches to ethics. The arguments herein rebut the alleged role of coherence in practical reasoning endorsed by Thagard. While there are some general lessons to be learned from the preceding, no attempt is made to argue against all forms of coherence in all contexts. Nor is the usefulness of computational modelling called into question. The point will be that coherence cannot be as useful in understanding moral reasoning as coherentists may think. This result has clear implications for the future of Machine Ethics, a newly emerging subfield of AI. }}</ref> == References == <!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags--> <references /> == External links == * [http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Eai50/homepage.html Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: The Next Fifty Years], conference Web site * [[Peter Norvig]], [http://pn.smugmug.com/Other-Events/AI50-Dartmouth-Conference/ Pictures from AI@50] === Notes and comments === * Meg Houston Maker [http://www.engagingexperience.com/], conference notes: * AI@50 Opening [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_opening.html] * AI — Past, Present Future [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_ai_past_pr.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by John McCarthy and [[Marvin Minsky]] :* The Future Model of Thinking [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Ron Brachman]] , [[David Mumford]], and [[Stuart Russell]] :* The Future of Network Models [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future_1.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and [[Simon Odinero]], and [[Rick Granger]] :* The Future of Learning and Search [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future_2.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Oliver Selfridge]], [[Ray Solomonoff]], [[Leslie Pack Kaelbling]], and [[Peter Norvig]] :* The Future of AI [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future_3.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Rod Brooks]], [[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]], [[Eric Horvitz]] :* The Future of Vision [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future_4.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Eric Grimson]], [[Takeo Kanade]], and [[Terry Sejnowski]] :* The Future of Reasoning [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future_5.html] :* Brief abstracts of papers by [[Alan Bundy]], [[Edwina Rissland]], and [[Bart Selman]] :* The Future of Language and Cognition [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future_6.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Trenchard More]], [[Eugene Charniak]], and [[Pat Langley]] :* The Future of the Future [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_the_future_7.html] :* Brief abstract of [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s paper :* AI and Games [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_ai_and_gam.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Jonathan Schaeffer]] and [[Danny Kopec]] :* Future Interactions with Intelligent Machines [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_future_int.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[Daniela Rus]] and [[Sherry Turkle]] :* Selected Submitted Papers: Future Strategies for AI [http://www.engagingexperience.com/2006/07/ai50_selected_s.html] — Brief abstracts of papers by [[J.

AIBO was discontinued in 2006. ==Overview== Being able to walk, "see" its environment via camera and recognize spoken commands in Spanish and English; AIBO robotic pets are considered to be [[autonomous robot]]s since they are able to learn and mature based on external stimuli from their owner or environment, or from other AIBOs. Artist [[Hajime Sorayama]] created the initial designs for the AIBO. The original designs are part of the permanent collections of MoMA and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The design won Sony and artist Sorayama the highest design award that may be conferred by Japan. On January 26, 2006 Sony announced that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products as of March, 2006 in Sony's effort to make the company more profitable. It also stopped development of the [[QRIO]] robot. AIBO will still be supported until 2013 (ERS7 model) and AIBO technology will continue to be developed for use in other consumer products.<ref> [http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/info/presen/05q3/qfhh7c000008adfe.html] [http://www.jp.aibo.com/support/clinic_info/notice_58.html]</ref> [[File:AiboKids.jpg|thumb|left|AIBO playing with children]] AIBOware (the name is a trademark of Sony corporation), is the title given to the [[software]] the AIBO runs on its pink [[Memory Stick]]. The ''Life'' AIBOware allows the robot to be raised from pup to fully grown adult while going through various stages of development as its owner interacts with it. The ''Explorer'' AIBOware allows the owner to interact with a fully mature robot able to understand (though not necessarily willing to obey) 100 voice commands. Without the AIBOware, the AIBO will run in what is called "clinic mode" and can only perform basic actions. Many AIBO owners enjoy teaching their pets new behaviors by reprogramming them (in Sony's special 'R-CODE' language). However, in October 2001, Sony sent a cease-and-desist notice to the webmaster of Aibopet, demanding that he stop distributing code that was retrieved by bypassing the [[copy protection]] mechanisms of the robot. Eventually, in the face of many outraged AIBO owners, Sony released a programmer's kit for 'non-commercial' use. The kit has now been expanded into three distinct tools: R-CODE, AIBO Remote Framework, and the OPEN-R SDK. These three tools are combined under the name AIBO Software Development Environment.
