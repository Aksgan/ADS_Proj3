interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually, the II<small>GS</small> gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping. The first 50,000 Apple II<small>GS</small> computers came with Steve Wozniak's "''Woz''" signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the "''Woz Limited Edition''". These machines are not functionally different from machines from the same time period without the signature. ===Apple IIc Plus=== {{Main|Apple IIc Plus}} [[Image:Apple IIc Plus (front).jpg|thumb|right|The Apple IIc Plus, an 8-bit revision of the original portable but with faster CPU, 3.5-inch floppy and built-in power supply. It was the last introduced of the Apple II line.]] The final Apple II model was the '''[[Apple IIc Plus]]''' introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5.25-inch floppy drive had been replaced with a 3Â½-inch drive, the power supply was moved inside (gone was the IIc's "brick on a leash" power supply), and the processor was a fast {{nowrap|4 MHz}} 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II<small>GS</small>. (Third-party accelerators for other models could, however, go as fast as {{nowrap|10 MHz}}, and II<small>GS</small> accelerators would eventually reach {{nowrap|16 MHz}}.) The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a [[megabyte]] of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II<small>GS</small>. Unlike the IIe, IIc and II<small>GS</small>, the IIc Plus came only in one version (American) and was not officially sold anywhere outside the USA. Many perceived the IIc Plus as Apple's attempt to compete with the [[Laser 128|Laser 128EX/2]], a popular third party Apple-compatible machine that also had an accelerated processor and a built-in 3.5-inch drive. There were few other rational explanations for Apple expending resources on the continued development of a new 8-bit Apple II model rather than furthering the 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. However, with its 3.5-inch drive and speedy processor, it was an excellent, compact machine for running the [[AppleWorks]] integrated productivity package, especially with the 1 MB memory upgrade. ===Apple IIe Card=== {{Main|Apple IIe Card}} Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the '''[[Apple IIe Card]]''', an expansion card for the [[Macintosh LC|LC]] line of [[Macintosh]] computers, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II<small>GS</small>), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through [[hardware emulation]] (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be "borrowed" by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3.5-inch floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II<small>GS</small> in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II<small>GS</small> that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released. ===Final years=== Apple's [[Macintosh]] product line finally eclipsed the Apple II in the early 1990s. Even after the Macintosh's introduction, the Apple II had remained the company's primary revenue source for years. The computer was the first to attract a loyal user community and many outspoken Apple II fans were bitter that the company had invested its Apple II profits into the Macintosh rather than using them to further the Apple II series. Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh until terminating the II<small>GS</small> in December, 1992<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.applematters.com/collections/apple-iigs/ |title=Apple IIGS // Collections |publisher=Applematters.com |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> and the IIe in November, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steven Weyhrich |url=http://apple2history.org/history/appy/ahb5.html |title=Apple II History Timeline |publisher=Apple2history.org |date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> ==Advertising, marketing, and packaging== [[Mike Markkula]],<ref name="Markkula1997">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|date=1997-09-01|work=[[New York Times]] | first=John | last=Markoff | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> a retired [[Intel]] salesman who provided early critical funding for Apple Computer, was keen on marketing. From 1977-1981, Apple used the [[Regis McKenna]] agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, [[Chiat/Day|Chiat-Day]] acquired Regis McKenna's advertising operations and Apple used Chiat-Day. At Regis McKenna Advertising, the team assigned to launch the Apple II consisted of [[Rob Janoff]], art director, Chip Schafer, copywriter and Bill Kelley, account executive. Janoff came up with the Apple logo with a bite out of it. The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lower case. Steve Jobs insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo. In its letterhead and business card implementation, the rounded "a" of the logotype echoed the "bite" in the logo. This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure; the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Ever since the original Apple II, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of [[Steve Jobs]]' personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final product appearance.<ref>[[Michael Moritz|Moritz, Michael]].
