synonymous with "Smart Client", and are used to refer to several other technological approaches including [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Java applet]]s and [[Webstart]] applications. The Smart Client approach came about because when businesses tried to develop [[web applications]] to replace their old desktop applications, user productivity decreased. This was because web-based user interfaces based on server-side [[HTML]] generation are typically not as responsive, have fewer hot keys and require more use of the mouse, etc. Smart Client applications bridge the gap between [[web applications]] and desktop applications. They provide the benefits of a web application (such as leveraging the internet and offering remote access to data) while still providing the snappy look and feel inherent to desktop applications. Mainly there are four platforms for building Smart client applications :<br /> [[Adobe_Flex|Flex]] : from Adobe.<br /> [[JavaFX]] : from SUN.<br /> [[Windows_Presentation_Foundation|Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)]] : for Microsoft <br /> [[DataSnap]]/WebServices : from CodeGear. <br /> Dedicated desktop boxes which offer Smart Client environments are starting to appear. The only one currently in production is Cranberry UK's SC20 Smart Client, in September 2007, which delivers applications via Citrix Application Streaming, traditional thin client hosted desktop, and locally integrated "thick client" applications. <ref name="cranberry-sc20">{{cite web | author = Cranberry UK | date = [[September 12]], [[2007]] | url = http://www.cranberrynet.com/pdfs/Info_Sheets/info%20sheet%206%20Technical%20Specification.pdf | title = "Cranberry SC20 Smart Client" | work = cranberrynet.com | publisher = Cranberry UK Ltd | accessdate = 2007-12-09 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>. {{reflist|2}} ==External links== * [http://www.symbyo.com/Custom-Software-Application-Development/smart-client-application.aspx Smart Client Applications] Smart Client Overview * [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/DotNetBuildSmClnts.aspx Building Smart Client using .NET] A brief overview and an example in .NET [[Category:Software architecture]] [[Category:Ajax (programming)| ]] [[Category:Buzzwords]] [[Category:Web 2.0]] [[de:Smart Client]] [[es:Smart client]] [[fr:Smart client]] [[nl:Smart client]] [[pt:Smart client]] [[ru:Smart client]] [[sv:Smart client]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34719</id> <title>Smartbook</title> <text>{{cleanup|date=January 2011}} {{Infobox general |name =Smartbook |image =Wistron Pursebook.jpg |caption =Wistron Pursebook, 1GHz Snapdragon ARM CPU (April 2009). }} A '''smartbook''' is a class of [[mobile device]] that combines certain features of both a [[smartphone|'''smart'''phone]] and [[netbook|net'''book''']].<ref name="cnet_1">{{cite web |url=http://ces.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10431884-269.html |title=CES: What, exactly, is a smartbook?
