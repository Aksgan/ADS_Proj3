The Evaluation sub-process was modeled using the meta-modeling technique. The dotted arrows running from the meta-process diagram (left) to the meta-data diagram (right) indicate which concepts are created/ adjusted in the corresponding activities. All of the activities in the evaluation phase are standard activities. For a short description of the Evaluation phase concepts see Table 2.4.2 where the concepts are listed and defined. {| class="wikitable" ! Concept !! Description |- | EVALUATION | Evaluated/checked implementation. |- | RESULTS | The outcome of the evaluated implementation. |- | SELF ASSESSMENT DOCUMENTS | Result of the examination of the security management by the organization of the process itself. |- | INTERNAL AUDIT | Result of the examination of the security management by the internal EDP auditor. |- | EXTERNAL AUDIT | Result of the examination of the security management by the external EDP auditor. |- | SECURITY INCIDENTS DOCUMENTS | Results of evaluating security events which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service. |} Table 2.4.2: Concept and definition evaluation sub-process Security management ===Maintenance=== It is necessary for the security to be maintained. Because of changes in the IT-infrastructure and changes in the organization itself security risks are bound to change over time. The maintenance of the security concerns both the maintenance of the security section of the service level agreements and the more detailed security plans. The maintenance is based on the results of the Evaluation sub-process and insight in the changing risks. These activities will only produce proposals. The proposals serve as inputs for the plan sub-process and will go through the whole cycle or the proposals can be taken in the maintenance of the service level agreements. In both cases the proposals could lead to activities in the action plan. The actual changes will be carried by the Change Management process. For more information about the Change Management Process consult the Change Management Wiki. The activities that take place in the maintain sub-process are summed up in the following table (Table 2.5.1). The table contains the name of the (sub) activity and a short definition of the activity. {| class="wikitable" ! Activities !! Sub-Activities !! Descriptions |- | rowspan="4" | Maintain | Maintenance of Service level agreements | This is a process to keep the service level agreements in proper condition. The process ends with MAINTAINED SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS. |- | Maintenance of operational level agreements | This is a process to keep the operational level agreements in proper condition. The process ends with MAINTAINED OPERATIONAL LEVEL AGREEMENTS. |- | Request for change to SLA and/or OLA | Request for a change to the SLA and/or OLA is formulated. This process ends with a REQUEST FOR CHANGE. |- | Reporting | In this process the whole maintain implemented security policies process is documented in a specific way. This process ends with REPORTS. |} Table 2.5.1: (Sub) activities and descriptions Maintenance sub-process ITIL Security Management Figure 2.5.1 is the process-data diagram of the implementation sub-process. This picture shows the integration of the meta-process model (left) and the meta-data model (right). The dotted arrows indicate which concepts are created or adjusted in the activities of the implementation phase. [[Image:Maintenance process data model.jpg]] Figure 2.5.1: Process-data model Maintenance sub-process The maintenance sub-process starts with the maintenance of the service level agreements and the maintenance of the operational level agreements. After these activities take place (in no particular order) and there is a request for a change the request for change activity will take place and after the request for change activity is concluded the reporting activity starts. If there is no request for a change then the reporting activity will start directly after the first two activities. The concepts in the meta-data model are created/ adjusted during the maintenance phase. For a list of the concepts and their definition take a look at table 2.5.2. {| class="wikitable" ! Concept !! Description |- | MAINTANENANCE DOCUMENTS | Agreements kept in proper condition. |- | MAINTAINED SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS | Service Level Agreements(security paragraph) kept in proper condition. |- | MAINTAINED OPERATIONAL LEVEL AGREEMENTS | Operational Level Agreements kept in proper condition. |- | REQUEST FOR CHANGE | Form, or screen, used to record details of a request for a change to the SLA/OLA. |} Table 2.5.2: Concept and definition Plan sub-process Security management ===Complete process-data model=== The following picture shows the complete process-data model of the Security Management process. This means that the complete meta-process model and the complete meta-data model and the integrations of the two models of the Security Management process are shown.
