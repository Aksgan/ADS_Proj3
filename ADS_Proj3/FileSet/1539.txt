intensifies health-based consumer protection in Germany. Food can be manufactured and sold within Germany without a special permission, as long as it does not cause any damage on consumers’ health and meets the general standards set by the legislation. However, manufacturers, carriers, importers and retailers are responsible for the food they pass into circulation. They are obliged to ensure and document the safety and quality of their food with the use of in-house control mechanisms. ===Hong Kong=== In [[Hong Kong SAR]], the [[Centre for Food Safety]] is in charge of ensuring food sold is safe and fit for consumption. ===Pakistan=== Pakistan does not have an integrated legal framework but has a set of laws, which deals with various aspects of food safety. These laws, despite the fact that they were enacted long time ago, have tremendous capacity to achieve at least minimum level of food safety. However, like many other laws, these laws remain very poorly enforced. There are four laws that specifically deal with food safety. Three of these laws directly focus issues related to food safety, while the fourth one namely Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority Act, is indirectly relevant to food safety. The Pure Food Ordinance, 1960 consolidates and amends the law in relation to the preparation and the sale of foods. All provinces and some northern areas have adopted this law with certain amendments. Its aim is to ensure purity of food being supplied to people in the market and, therefore, provides for preventing adulteration. The Pure Food Ordinance 1960 does not apply to cantonment areas. There is separate law for cantonments called "The Cantonment Pure Food Act, 1966". There is no substantial difference between the Pure Food Ordinance 1960 and The Cantonment Pure Food Act. Even the rules of operation are very much similar. Pakistan Hotels and Restaurant Act, 1976 applies to all hotels and restaurants in Pakistan and seeks to control and regulate the rates and standard of service(s) by hotels and restaurants. In addition to other provisions, under section 22(2), the sale of food or beverages that are contaminated, not prepared hygienically or served in utensils that are not hygienic or clean is an offense. There are no express provisions for consumer complaints in the Pakistan Restaurants Act, 1976, Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority Act, 1996. However, the laws do not prevent citizens from lodging complaints with the concerned government officials. However, the consideration and handling of complaints is a matter of discretion of the officials.<ref>Mazhar Siraj, 2004,http://www.crcp.org.pk/doc_files/Food%20Safety%20Legislation%20in%20Pakistan.doc, Consumer Rights Commission of Pakistan.</ref> ===South Korea=== ====Korea Food & Drug Administration==== [[Korea Food & Drug Administration]] (KFDA)<ref>{{cite web |title=Korea Food & Drug Administration |url=http://www.kfda.go.kr/}}</ref> is working for food safety since 1945.

The National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation is a national organization for toxicological tests and research. Under the Korea Food & Drug Administration, the Institute performs research on toxicology, pharmacology, and risk analysis of foods, drugs, and their additives. The Institute strives primarily to understand important biological triggering mechanisms and improve assessment methods of human exposure, sensitivities, and risk by (1) conducting basic, applied, and policy research that closely examines biologically triggering harmful effects on the regulated products such as foods, food additives, and drugs, and (2) operating the national toxicology program for the toxicological test development and inspection of hazardous chemical ubstances assessments. The Institute ensures safety by (1) investigation and research on safety by its own researchers, (2) contract research by external academicians and research centers. ===United States=== {{tasks |expand= [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Food_safety#Changing_USA_Regulations USA regulations] }} The US food system is regulated by numerous federal, state and local officials. Although the US food safety system is one of the best in the world, it is lacking in "organization, regulatory tools, and resources to address food borne illness."<ref>Becker, Geoffrey, The Federal Food Safety System: A primer, Congressional Research Service, 4/10/10</ref> ==== Federal level regulation ==== The [[Food and Drug Administration]] publishes the Food Code, a model set of guidelines and procedures that assists food control jurisdictions by providing a scientifically sound technical and legal basis for regulating the retail and food service industries, including [[restaurants]], [[grocery stores]] and institutional foodservice providers such as [[nursing homes]]. Regulatory agencies at all levels of government in the United States use the FDA Food Code to develop or update food safety rules in their jurisdictions that are consistent with national food regulatory policy. According to the FDA, 48 of 56 [[US State|states]] and [[US Territories|territories]], representing 79% of the U.S. population, have adopted food codes patterned after one of the five versions of the Food Code, beginning with the 1993 edition.<ref
