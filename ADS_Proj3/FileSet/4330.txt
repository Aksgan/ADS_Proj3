in explaining change as it was in describing it. <ref>(Trigger, 1989:308).</ref> Systems Theory also eventually went on to show that predictions that a high amount of cultural regularities would be found were certainly overly optimistic during the early stages of [[Processual archaeology]].<ref> (Trigger, 1989:312).</ref> Ironically enough this is exactly the opposite of what Processual archaeologists were hoping it would be able to do with Systems Theory. However it was not completely a disappointment and Systems Theory is still used to describe how variables inside a cultural system can interact. If nothing else the use of Systems Theory was an important early step in the rise of the [[New Archaeology]]. It was a call against the Culture-Historical methods of the “old timers”. It was “proof” that archaeology could be done scientifically and objectively and that information about past lifeways could be discovered, and that the pitfalls that seemed so overwhelming could, perhaps, be sidestepped as long as archaeologists were rigorous enough. == Further reading == * Sally R.

In nature, systems thinking examples include ecosystems in which various elements such as air, water, movement, plants, and animals work together to survive or perish. In organizations, systems consist of people, structures, and processes that work together to make an organization healthy or unhealthy. Systems Thinking has been defined as an approach to problem solving, by viewing "problems" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to specific part, outcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences. Systems thinking is not one thing but a set of habits or practices <ref>http://www.watersfoundation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=materials.main</ref> within a framework that is based on the belief that the [[wikt:component|component]] parts of a [[system]] can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. Systems thinking focuses on cyclical rather than linear cause and effect. In science systems, it is argued that the only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the parts in relation to the whole.<ref>Capra, F. (1996) ''The web of life: a new scientific understanding of living systems'' (1st Anchor Books ed). New York: Anchor Books. p. 30</ref> Standing in contrast to [[Descartes|Descartes's]] [[scientific reductionism]] and [[philosophical analysis]], it proposes to view systems in a [[holism|holistic]] manner. Consistent with [[systems philosophy]], systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system. Science systems thinking attempts to illustrate that events are separated by distance and time and that small catalytic events can cause large changes in [[complex system]]s. Acknowledging that an improvement in one area of a system can adversely affect another area of the system, it promotes [[organizational communication]] at all levels in order to avoid the [[Information silo|silo effect]]. Systems thinking techniques may be used to study any kind of system — [[nature|natural]], [[science|scientific]], [[Engineering|engineered]], [[human]], or [[concept]]ual. ==The concept of a system== Science systems thinkers consider that: * a [[system]] is a dynamic and complex whole, interacting as a structured functional unit; * [[energy]], [[material]] and [[information]] flow among the different elements that compose the system; * a system is a community situated within an environment; * energy, material and information flow from and to the surrounding environment via semi-permeable membranes or boundaries; * systems are often composed of entities seeking equilibrium but can exhibit [[oscillating]], [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], or [[Exponential function|exponential]] behavior. A holistic system is any set (group) of interdependent or [[time|temporally]] interacting parts. ''Parts'' are generally systems themselves and are composed of other parts, just as systems are generally parts or ''[[holons]]'' of other systems. Science systems and the application of science systems thinking has been grouped into three categories based on the techniques used to tackle a system: * [[Hard systems]] — involving [[simulation]]s, often using [[computer]]s and the techniques of [[operations research]]/[[management science]]. Useful for problems that can justifiably be quantified. However it cannot easily take into account unquantifiable variables (opinions, culture, politics, etc), and may treat people as being passive, rather than having complex motivations. * [[Soft systems methodology|Soft systems]] — For systems that cannot easily be quantified, especially those involving people holding multiple and conflicting frames of reference. Useful for understanding motivations, viewpoints, and interactions and addressing qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions of problem situations. Soft systems are a field that utilizes foundation methodological work developed by [[Peter Checkland]], [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]] and their colleagues at [[Lancaster University]]. [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological analysis]] is a complementary method for structuring and analysing non-quantifiable problem complexes. * [[Evolutionary systems]] — [[Béla H. Bánáthy]] developed a methodology that is applicable to the design of complex social systems. This technique integrates critical systems inquiry with [[Soft systems methodology|soft systems methodologies]]. Evolutionary systems, similar to [[Dynamical system|dynamic systems]] are understood as open, complex systems, but with the capacity to evolve over time. Bánáthy uniquely integrated the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] perspectives of systems research (including [[chaos]], [[complexity]], [[cybernetics]]), [[cultural anthropology]], [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary theory]], and others. ==The systems approach== The systems thinking approach incorporates several tenets:<ref>{{cite book | last = Skyttner | first = Lars | title = General Systems Theory: Problems, Perspective, Practice | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Company | year = 2006 | isbn = 9-812-56467-5}}</ref> * [[Interdependence]] of objects and their attributes - independent elements can never constitute a system * [[Holism]] - [[Emergence|emergent properties]] not possible to detect
