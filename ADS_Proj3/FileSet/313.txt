(E.g., see: [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]].) An attack can be perpetrated by an ''insider'' or from'' outside'' the organization;<ref name=rfc2828/> :An "inside attack" is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an "insider"), i.e., an entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted the authorization. :An "outside attack" is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (an "outsider"). In the Internet, potential outside attackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists, and hostile governments.

The result can potentially compromises the [[Confidentiality]], [[Integrity]] or [[Availability]] properties of resources (potentially different that the vulnerable one) of the organization and others involved parties (customers, suppliers).<br /> The so called [[CIA triad]] is the basis of [[Information Security]]. The attack can be ''active'' when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises Integrity or Availability.
