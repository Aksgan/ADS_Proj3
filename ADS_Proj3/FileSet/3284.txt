running to serve the client processes and to provide data from the [[relational database]] in the backend. oos.cc also provides an integrated development environment called Developer Suite, which allows the community to build own applications for the desktop environment based on reBOX (see development section below). == License == All applications available in oos.cc are open source under the [[European Union Public Licence]] (EUPL). The reBOX development toolkit is free to use developing any applications for the webtop. == Features == As mentioned above, all applications published on oos.cc are open source based on the [[European Union Public Licence|EUPL]], and can be "installed" or "deinstalled" to what-ever preferences the user has. Currently, and besides global services like the multi-language support or the global theme support, as well as some minor tools and games, oos.cc offers four major services that can be used completely free of charge. * Integrated and fully flexible file storage (1 [[Gigabyte|GB]] per user) ** [[HTTP]] as well as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] file transfer from and to local file system ** User-based file-shares within the oos-community ** [[WebDAV]] access ** Document Management (including Version Control and File Locking mechanisms) * Image publishing, organization and post-processing * A free [[sub domain]] (user.oos.cc) for web- or image publishing, directly integrated in the desktop * [[Groupware]] applications, including free mail, fetchmail and contact management * An integrated development environment where oos-applications can be created directly from within the system (see development section below) Next releases are planned to focus on an extensive security and privacy suite, dealing with challenges like anonymous communication (browsing as well as temporary mail-addresses) as well as offering encrypted password and file storage and connectivity services. Since it initial stable release, OOS.cc can be accessed using [[https]] to ensure secure communication. == Limitations and drawbacks == * Limited number of applications: no commercial applications can be hosted. Only reviewed applications are being published * No processing of popular office formats (.doc, .odt, etc.) * Limited language support: Only English, German and Spanish * Dependence on foreign infrastructure: No possibility to extend storage, no additional/guaranteed bandwidth, etc. == Development == One of the key focuses of the team was right from the beginning to offer a very flexible and comprehensive API, that can be used to develop not only custom applications within oos.cc, but also stand-alone web-applications or to integrate single components in existing web-sites. By decoupling the development from web-related "problems" using the reBOX API web-applications can be development in a similar fashion to any [[Java (programming language)|Java]] program: Elements can be positioned and can interact like in high-level [[object oriented]] programming languages, without taking care of [[div]]s, browser specific behavior or communication handling. The framework also offers multi-language and theme support for existing as well as newly created applications, allowing changing almost every aspect of the look and feel of the used components according to the preferences of its users. For taking advantage of this approach, one of the applications offered in the OOS is an integrated Development Suite, allowing directly writing and executing code and hence creating new programs within the boundaries of the Webtop. As all applications on oos.cc are released as open source, all existing programs are offered to be imported, reviewed or changed and then locally deployed. Following this idea, every user is free to submit changed or newly created applications to be included in the globally offered application set. The current release offers features like auto-completion and an outline-window. ==See also== * [[Web portal]] * [[Web desktop]] * [[Web operating system]] === Similar applications === * [[youOS]] * [[eyeOS]] * [[DesktopTwo]] * [[G.ho.st]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://oos.cc/ Official Project Homepage] * [http://icube.at/oos.jsp Project Description] * [http://icube.at Official Company Homepage] [[Category:Web operating systems]] [[ar:نظام التشغيل على الانترنت]] [[de:Online Operating System]] [[pt:Oos]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27253</id> <title>Online Presence Ontology</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Primary sources|date=August 2008}} {{Cleanup-jargon|date=April 2009}} {{Notability|date=April 2009}} <!-- [[Image:Opo logo.jpg‎|thumb|150|The OPO logo]] Unclear copyright status.--> The '''OPO (Online Presence Ontology)''' is an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] which aims to model the dynamic aspects of a user’s presence online and to enable exchange of the Online Presence data. The creator of the OPO is [[Milan Stankovic (computer science) | Milan Stankovic]], a young researcher and a member of the [[GOOD OLD AI]] Research Network. OPO is mentioned in W3C Social Web Incubator Group final report<ref>[http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/socialweb/XGR-socialweb-20101206/ W3C Social Web Incubator Group Final Report]</ref> as one of the vocabularies that support the publishing of Social Web data on the Semantic Web, along with [[FOAF]] and [[SIOC]]. ==Ontology== OPO is a descriptive vocabulary expressed using the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) and the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). As such, it can be used by machines (software) for manipulating with user's OPO data or doing different analysis of user's online activity, for instance by querying it with an [[RDF query language]] (e.g. [[SPARQL]]). ==Ontology Design== [[Image:Opo-classes.png|thumb|300px|right|Class diagram of the Online Presence Ontology.]] The main concept in OPO is the '''OnlinePresence'''. It represents a placeholder for all the aspects of a user’s presence in the [[online world]]. '''OnlineStatusComponent''' represents an abstract component of the OnlinePresence; its subclasses define different dimensions of a user’s presence in the online world and describe the nature of the Online Presence. The '''Findability''' stands for a user's willingness to let other users find his/her contact details in public listings. The '''Notifiability''' component can be used to declare willingness of a user to receive notifications from applications (on which he/she is logged on), while '''OnlineStatus''' represents the [[Instant messaging|IM]] status, used on IM platforms. OnlineStatus in turn, has its own components that enable more precise descriptions of different statuses used by IM platforms. Those components are: '''Visibility''', '''Activity''', '''Contactability''' , and '''Disturbability'''. ==Implementation== Apart from facilitating the integration of online presence data from various sources, OPO can also be beneficial for transferring data from one service to another. A lot of users do copy-paste of their custom messages, for example from [[gTalk]] to [[Facebook]] (and vice versa). Likewise, they tend to upload the same
