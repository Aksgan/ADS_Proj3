countries. It is probably the largest database of its kind in the world. The data includes demographic information for the patient, and multiple determinations of the amount of virus in the patient’s bloodstream, CD4 cells counts (a white blood cell critical to the function of the [[immune system]] that HIV targets and destroys), genetic code of the patients virus, and details of the drugs that have been used to treat the patient. The RDI has used these data to conduct extensive research in order to develop the most accurate system possible for the prediction of treatment response. This research involved the development and comparison of different computational modelling methods including [[artificial neural networks]], [[support vector machines]], [[random forests]] and logistical regression<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dechao|year=2009|title=A comparison of three computational modelling methods for the prediction of virological response to combination HIV therapy|journal=[[Artificial Intelligence in Medicine]]|issue=1|pages=6374|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2009.05.002|volume=47}}</ref>. The predictions of the RDI’s models have historically [[correlated]] well with the actual changes in virus load of patients in the clinic, typically achieving a correlation co-efficient of 0.8 or more<ref>{{cite journal|last=Larder|first=Brendan|year=2007|title=The development of artificial neural networks to predict virological response to combination HIV therapy|journal=[[Antiviral Therapy]]|issue=12|pages=15–24|volume=12}}</ref>. The most recent models have predicted whether a combination treatment will reduce the level of virus in the patient’s bloodstream to undetectable levels with an accuracy of approximately 80%, significantly better than just using a genotype with rules-based interpretation. As clinics in resource-limited settings are often unable to afford genotyping, the RDI has developed models that predict treatment response without the need for a genotype, with only a small loss of accuracy<ref>{{cite journal|last=Revell|first=Andrew|year=2010|title=Modelling response to HIV therapy without a genotype: an argument for viral load monitoring in resource-limited settings|journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]]|issue=4|pages=605–607|doi=10.1093/jac/dkq032|volume=65}}</ref>. In October 2010, following clinical testing in two multinational studies, the RDI made its experimental system, HIV-TRePS available over the Internet. In January 2011, two clinical studies were published indicating that use of the HIV-TRePS system could lead to clinical and economic benefits<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brendan|first=Larder|year=2011|title=Clinical Evaluation of the Potential Utility of Computational Modeling as an HIV Treatment Selection Tool by Physicians with Considerable HIV Experience|journal=AIDS Patient Care and STDs|issue=1|pages=29–36|doi=10.1089/apc.2010.0254|volume=25}}</ref>. The studies, conducted by expert HIV physicians in the USA, Canada and Italy, showed that use of the system was associated with changes of treatment decision to combinations involving fewer drugs overall, which were predicted to result in better virological responses, suggesting that use of the system could potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall number and cost of drugs used. ==RDI Personnel== ===RDI Executive=== * Dr Brendan Larder - Scientific Chair * Dr Andrew Revell - Executive Director * Dr Dechao Wang - Director Bioinformatics * Daniel Coe – Director of Software Development ===International Advisory Group=== * Dr Julio Montaner (BC Centre For Excellence in HIV/AIDS, [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]) * Dr Carlo Torti (University of [[Brescia]], [[Italy]]) * Dr John Baxter ([[Cooper University Hospital]], Camden, NJ, [[USA]]) * Dr Sean Emery (National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]) * Dr Jose Gatell (Hospital Clinic of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]) * Dr Brian Gazzard ([[Chelsea and Westminster Hospital]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]) * Dr Anna-Maria Geretti ([[Royal Free Hospital]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]) * Dr Richard Harrigan (BC Centre For Excellence in HIV/AIDS, [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]) ==References== <references /> ==External links== * [http://www.hivrdi.org RDI official site] [[Category:Information systems]] [[Category:Medical informatics]] [[Category:Health software]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]] [[Category:HIV/AIDS]] [[Category:Evidence-based medicine]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31938</id> <title>Resourcesat-2</title> <text>{{Infobox Spacecraft | Name = Resourcesat-2 | Image = | Caption = | Organisation = [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] | Major_Contractors = | Bus = | Mission_Type = [[Remote-sensing]] | Decay = | Launch = February 2011 | Carrier_Rocket = [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle|PSLV-C16]] | Launch_Site = [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]] | NSSDC_ID = | Mass = | Orbit_regime = [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]] | Orbit_regime = [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Polar Sun-Synchronous]] [[Circular orbit]] | Orbital_Period = 102 minutes | Apoapsis = {{km to mi|817|spell=commonwealth|wiki=yes}} | Periapsis = {{km to mi|817|spell=commonwealth|wiki=yes}} | Inclination = 98.72<sup>o</sup> }} '''Resourcesat-2''' is a follow on mission to Resourcesat-1, by [[ISRO]]. Compared to Resourcesat-1, LISS-4 multispectral swath has been enhanced from 23 km to 70 km based on user needs. Suitable changes including miniaturization in payload electronics have been incorporated in Resourcesat-2. Resourcesat-2 is slated for launch in February 2011. ==Current status== As of 2008, the engineering model structure after refurbishment has been delivered for assembly, integration and test.

Depending on the [[database system]], the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known. Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on-the-fly. [[Precomputation]]s often impose undesired performance impacts. A result set is effectively a table. The [[order by (SQL)|<code>ORDER BY</code>]] clause can be used in a query to impose a certain sort condition on the rows. Without that clause, there is no guarantee whatsoever on the order in which the rows are returned. {{DEFAULTSORT:Result Set}} [[Category:Databases]] Jab {{Compu-soft-stub}} [[uk:Результуючий набір]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31957</id> <title>Retina Vulnerability Assessment Scanner</title> <text>{{primary sources|date=November 2009}} '''Retina Vulnerability Assessment Scanner''' is a vulnerability scanner created by [[eEye Digital Security]] that remotely scans a network for [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] and assigns a level of threat to those discovered.
