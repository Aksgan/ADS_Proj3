prototype, and offers feedback on its suitability. This process is repeated until the end-user is satisfied with the final system. ===Joint application design (JAD)=== [[Joint application design]] (JAD) is a methodology which evolved from RAD, in which a systems designer consults with a group consisting of the following parties: * Executive sponsor * Systems Designer * Managers of the system JAD involves a number of stages, in which the group collectively develops an agreed pattern for the design and implementation of the system. == Systems design: Topics == * [[Requirements analysis]] - analyzes the needs of the end users or customers * [[Benchmarking]] — is an effort to evaluate how current systems are used * [[Systems architecture]] - creates a [[blueprint]] for the design with the necessary specifications for the hardware, software, people and data resources. In many cases, multiple architectures are evaluated before one is selected. * [[Design]] — designers will produce one or more 'models' of what they see a system eventually looking like, with ideas from the analysis section either used or discarded. A document will be produced with a description of the system, but nothing is specific — they might say 'touchscreen' or 'GUI operating system', but not mention any specific brands; * [[Computer programming]] and [[debugging]] in the software world, or detailed design in the consumer, enterprise or commercial world - specifies the final system components. * [[System testing]] - evaluates the system's actual functionality in relation to expected or intended functionality, including all integration aspects. == See also == * [[Architectural pattern (computer science)]] * [[Electronic design automation]] * [[Electronic system level]] * [[Embedded system]] * [[Graphical system design]] * [[Operating Systems Design and Implementation]] * [[Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method]] * [[Systems Development Life Cycle]] * [[Systems thinking]] == References == <references/> == Further reading == * [[C.

Systems engineering processes are related to the stages in a [[System Development Life Cycle|system life cycle]]. The systems engineering process usually begins at an early stage of the system life cycle and at the very beginning of a project, but as stated by Bahill and Briggs (2001), systems engineering can also start at the middle. A variety of systems engineering processes have been proposed by different organizations. == History == Several systems engineering methods and process guidelines have been developed since 1969. These methods describe all the activities and deliverables of a systems engineering project. The first, Mil-Std-499 is a military standard of the U.S. Department of Defense and was used to create complex systems, for example, a nuclear submarine or missiles. The build up body of knowledge has become known as systems engineering. Since IEEE has developed 1220, the systems engineering standard has become commercial. The early systems engineering methods, such as Mil-Std-499B (see figure 1), are focused on the verification and development life cycle functions, but the later methods cover almost the whole system life cycle. Systems engineering and software engineering have evolved as independent processes, but recent process guidelines and standards emphasize the need for integrating both these processes. (Boehm, 2005) [[Image:history.png|right|thumb|400px|Figure 1: History of systems engineering methods and process guidelines]] == Process description == The [[meta-model]] in figure 2 shows a systems engineering method. The activities in the model can be somewhat different in a specific project. This is derived from several existing standards, marked in figure 1. ANSI/EIA 632 serves as the basis for this method, since many current systems engineering methods are based on this standard. Further, ISO/IEC 15288 and the [[INCOSE]] [http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/sehandbook.aspx Systems Engineering Handbook], which are more recent, serve as source for this method. The final source is an older standard, Mil-Std-499B. The activities and concepts in the model are explained [[#activities|here]]. The model is separated in four main processes. The Agreement, Project, Technical and Evaluation processes. These will be explained in further detail below. === Agreement processes=== The first step in the systems engineering process is to establish an agreement with the customer, in order to build a new system. This order is set when the outcome of the [[feasibility study]] is positive: there is a need for a new system and there is no other system that can be used or it will be more cost effective to create a new system. When the outcome is negative, the project will end here. The input of the feasibility study is an acquisition phase and a problem definition. A well known way to acquire knowledge is the structured or unstructured [[interview]]. This technique and several other acquisition techniques can be used to define the needs of the customer, user and other stake holders. === Project processes === After an agreement is made, the planning of the project will begin and this results in a [[project plan]], which can be modified during the technical
