product databases and archiving. Typically STEP can be used to [[CAD data exchange|exchange data]] between [[CAD]], [[Computer-aided manufacturing]], [[Computer-aided engineering]], [[Product Data Management]]/[[EDM]] and other [[CAx]] systems. STEP is addressing product data from mechanical and electrical design, [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]], analysis and manufacturing, with additional information specific to various industries such as [[automotive]], [[aerospace]], [[building construction]], [[ship]], [[oil]] and [[gas]], process plants and others. STEP is developed and maintained by the ISO technical committee TC 184, ''Automation systems and integration'', sub-committee SC 4, ''Industrial data''. Like other ISO and IEC standards STEP is copyright by ISO and is not freely available. Other standards developed and maintained by ISO TC 184/SC 4 are: * [[ISO 13584]] PLIB - Parts Library * ISO 15531 MANDATE - Industrial manufacturing management data * [[ISO 15926]] Process Plants including Oil and Gas facilities Life-Cycle data * [[ISO 18629]] PSL- Process specification language * ISO 18876 IIDEAS - Integration of industrial data for exchange, access, and sharing * ISO 22745 Open technical dictionaries and their application to master data * [[ISO 8000]] Data quality STEP is closely related with PLIB (ISO 13584, IEC 61360). == History == The evolution of STEP can be divided into four release phases. The development of STEP started in 1984 as a successor of [[IGES]], SET and [[VDA-FS]].<ref>ISO TC184 / SC4 resolution 1, Gaithersburg - July 1984</ref> The initial plan was that "STEP shall be based on one single, complete, implementation-independent Product Information Model, which shall be the Master Record of the integrated topical and application information models".<ref>ISO TC184 / SC4 resolution 33, Tokyo - December 1988</ref> But because of the complexity, the standard had to be broken up into smaller parts that can be developed, balloted and approved separately.<ref>ISO TC184 / SC4 resolution 55, Paris - January 1990</ref> In 1994/95 ISO published the '''initial release''' of STEP as international standards (IS) with the parts 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 101, AP 201 and AP 203.<ref>ISO TC184 / SC4 resolution 195 and 196, Davos - May 1994</ref> Today AP 203 <cite>Configuration controlled 3D design</cite> is still one of the most important parts of STEP and supported by many CAD systems for import and export. In the second phase the capabilities of STEP got widely extended, primarily for the design of products in the aerospace, automotive, electrical, electronic, and other industries. This phase ended in the year 2002 with the second major release, including the STEP parts AP 202, 209, AP 210, AP 212, AP 214, AP 224, AP 225, AP 227, AP 232.<ref>ISO TC184 / SC4 resolution 361, Bad Aibling, Germany â€“ June 1998</ref> Basic harmonization between the APs especially in the geometric areas was achieved by introducing the Application Interpreted Constructs (AIC, 500 series). A major problem with the monolithic APs of the first and second release is that they are too big, have too much overlap with each other and are not sufficiently harmonized. These deficits lead to the development of the [[ISO 10303 Application Modules|STEP modular architecture]] (400 and 1000 series).<ref>ISO TC184 / SC4 resolution 394, San Francisco, California - January 1999</ref> This activity was primarily driven by new AP covering additional life-cycle phases such as early requirement analysis (AP 233) and maintenance and repair (AP 239), and also new industrial areas (AP 221, 236). New editions of the previous monolithic APs on a modular basis have been developed (AP 203, 209, 210). The publication of these new editions coincide with the release of the new ISO product '''SMRL''', the STEP Module and Resource Library, in 2010 that contains all STEP resource parts and application modules on a single CD. The SMRL will be revised frequently. At the end of 2010 the seventh Change Request (CR) of the SMRL has been worked out. In mid 2010 the development of the new major AP 242 ''Managed model based 3d engineering'' has been initiated. The first edition of AP242 is expected to be technically complete in 2011 and is dedicated to replace the most successful STEP APs 203, 214 and other APs in the mechanical design area in an upward compatible way. In particular it will contain major updates in the area of [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] and [[Kinematics]]. Future editions of AP242 will extend the scope further. == Structure == {{Main|List of STEP (ISO 10303) parts}} STEP is divided into many parts, grouped into * Environment ** Parts 1x: Description methods: [[ISO 10303-11|EXPRESS]], EXPRESS-X ** Parts 2x: Implementation methods: [[ISO 10303-21|STEP-File]], [[ISO 10303-28|STEP-XML]], [[ISO 10303-22|SDAI]] ** Parts 3x: [[Conformance testing]] methodology and framework * Integrated data models ** The Integrated Resources (IR), consisting of *** Parts 4x and 5x: Integrated generic resources *** Parts 1xx: Integrated application resources *** [[ISO 13584|PLIB ISO 13584-20]] ''Parts library: Logical model of expressions'' ** Parts 5xx: Application Integrated Constructs (AIC) ** Parts 1xxx: [[ISO 10303 Application Modules|Application Modules]] (AM) * Top parts ** Parts 2xx: Application Protocols (AP) ** Parts 3xx: Abstract Test Suites (ATS) for APs ** Parts 4xx: [[ISO 10303 Application Modules|Implementation modules]] for APs In total STEP consists of several hundred parts and every year new parts are added or new revisions of older parts are released. This makes STEP the biggest standard within ISO. Each part has its own scope and introduction The APs are the top parts. They cover a particular application and industry domain and hence are most relevant for users of STEP. Every AP defines one or several Conformance Classes, suitable for a particular kind of product or data exchange scenario. To provide a better understanding of the scope, information requirements and usage scenarios an informative application activity model (AAM) is added to every AP, using [[IDEF0]] STEP is primarily defining data models using the EXPRESS modeling language. Application data according to a given data model can be exchanged either by a [[STEP-File]], [[STEP-XML]] or via shared database access using [[SDAI]]. Every AP defines a top data models to be used for data exchange, called the ''Application Integrated Model'' (AIM) or
