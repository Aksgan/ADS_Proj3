It will provide automatic updates, community support, downloadable content and other unannounced features.<ref name="Gamespot E3 Portal 2">[http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6265808/portal-2-steamworks-ps3-bound-in-2011]</ref> ===Steam Translation Server=== In March 2010 Valve launched the [https://translation.steampowered.com/ Steam Translation Server], which is a service that allows Steam users to help in the translation of Steam and a selected library of Steam games. The service was undergoing a closed beta until October 2010. Since then, every Steam user has the ability to apply as a translator. ===Webmoney support=== On 18 December 2010, Valve officially launched support for [[Webmoney]] payment system. It can be used from the following countries: Azerbaijan, Belarus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name='News - WebMoney Now Available on Steam'>http://store.steampowered.com/news/4806/</ref> ==Criticism== ===Regional restrictions and pricing=== [[File:Steam_regional_limitation.PNG|thumb|Some games purchased in one region become unplayable if user moves to another.]] Steam allows developers and publishers to change prices and restrict game availability depending on the user's location. This can cause some games to cost more than retail prices, despite digital distribution removing the costs of manufacturing, packaging, design, and logistics.<ref name="cnetsteamed">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/broadband/0,239036008,339288255,00.htm|title=Getting Steamed: digital distribution for games isn't there yet|last=Craig|first=Simms|date=April 18, 2008|accessdate=April 25, 2008|publisher=[[CNET]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lovemoney.com/news/ways-to-save/how-your-pc-can-entertain-you-for-less-4028.aspx |title=How your PC can entertain you for less |publisher=Lovemoney.com |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref><ref name="steamworks_pubservs">{{Cite web|url=http://steamgames.com/steamworks/publishingservices.php|title=Steamworks publishing services|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref> Valve also restricts game registration and playability to the buyer's country of residence. One example of this regional restriction can be seen where Valve uses Steam's authentication to prevent boxed versions of their games sold in Russia and Thailand, which are priced significantly lower than elsewhere, from being used outside those territories.<ref name="thai_restrictions_07">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/49656|title=Valve Responds to Steam Territory Deactivations (Updated)|last=Breckon|first=Nick|date=October 29, 2007|accessdate=November 26, 2007|publisher=ShackNews}}</ref> Steam offers products in three [[currencies]]; [[US Dollar]], [[Euro]] and [[Pound Sterling]]. The currency is selected automatically based on the user's location, and cannot be changed. Due to how Steam handles the [[US Dollar]] to [[Euro]]/[[Pound Sterling]] conversion, prices in [[Eurozone]] countries are often much higher than in the United States, which has led to much criticism from European Steam users since the Euro support was introduced on December 12, 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/79349/Valve_Inflicts_European_Gamers_with_$1_=_%E2%82%AC1_Equation.html|title=Valve Inflicts European Gamers with $1 = €1 Equation|date=December 19, 2008|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}</ref> ===Authentication=== It is necessary to authenticate every Steam game online, whether purchased via Steam itself or installed via a retail disc, the first time it is played.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/09/5351.ars |title=Microsoft previews online software purchasing with the Digital Locker |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2005-09-26 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> After the initial authentication, an offline mode allows games to be run without being connected to your Steam account. According to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, Steam's availability is not guaranteed and Valve is under no legal obligation to release an update disabling the authentication system in the event that Steam becomes permanently unavailable.<ref name="ssa">{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/|title=Steam Subscriber Agreement|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=January 31, 2009}}</ref> Despite this, [[Gabe Newell]], CEO of Valve, said in a post on the Steam User Forums that "Unless there was some situation I don't understand, we would presumably disable authentication before any event that would preclude the authentication servers from being available." He added, "We've tested disabling authentication, and it works."{{Fact|date=December 2010}} ==See also== *[[List of Steam titles]] ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Steam (content delivery)|Steam}} * [http://store.steampowered.com/ Steam website] - Official website * [http://steampowered.com/steamworks Steamworks] - Steamworks information * [http://steamcommunity.com/ The Steam Community] - Web access to Steam's social network * [http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:Steam Valve Developer Community/Steam] - Steam category on the official VDC Wiki {{Valve technology}} {{Digital Distribution Platforms}} {{URI scheme}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Steam (Content Delivery)}} [[Category:2003 introductions]] [[Category:Cloud computing]] [[Category:Digital rights management]] [[Category:Electronic commerce]] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:Multiplayer gaming service]] [[Category:Online retailers]] [[Category:Software based on Webkit]] [[Category:Valve Corporation]] [[Category:Windows software]] {{Link FA|de}} {{Link FA|ru}} [[cs:Steam]] [[da:Steam]] [[de:Steam]] [[es:Steam]] [[fr:Steam]] [[ko:스팀 (플랫폼)]] [[ia:Steam]] [[it:Steam (informatica)]] [[hu:Steam]] [[nl:Steam (softwareplatform)]] [[ja:Steam]] [[no:Valve Corporation#Steam]] [[pl:Steam]] [[pt:Steam]] [[ru:Steam]] [[sk:Steam (program)]] [[sl:Steam]] [[fi:Steam]] [[sv:Steam (datorspelsteknik)]] [[tr:Steam (İçerik sağlayıcı)]] [[uk:Steam]] [[zh:Steam]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35679</id> <title>Steamcon</title> <text><!-- Do not use the "dated prod" template directly; the above line is generated by "subst:prod|reason" --> {{Infobox Convention | name = Steamcon® | image = [[File:Steamconlogo.pdf|thumb|alt=Alt text|Steamcon Logo]] | caption = | status = Active | genre = [[Steampunk]] | venue = Seattle Airport Marriott and Hilton | location = {{flagicon|Washington}} [[SeaTac, Washington|Sea-Tac]], Washington | country = {{USA}} | first = | last = | organizer = | filing = | attendance = | website = http://www.steamcon.org/ }} '''Steamcon'''® is one of the largest regional [[steampunk]] conventions/[[symposium]] in the [[United States]].
