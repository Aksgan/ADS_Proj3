In other words, it allows them to "see" neural activity and study the functioning of the [[brain]]. In this method, a near-infrared laser is positioned on the [[scalp]]. Detectors composed of [[optical fiber]] bundles are located a few [[centimeter]]s away from the light source. These detectors sense how the path of light is altered, either through [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[scattering]], as it traverses brain tissue. This method can provide two types of information. First, it can be used to measure the absorption of light, which is related to concentration of [[chemical]]s in the brain. Second, it can measure the scattering of light, which is related to physiological characteristics such as the swelling of [[glia]] and [[neuron]]s that are associated with neuronal firing. Typical applications include rapid 2D optical ''[[topographic]]'' imaging of the [[event-related optical signal]] (EROS) or [[Near infrared spectroscopy]] (NIRS) signal following [[human brain|brain]] activity and ''[[tomography|tomographic]]'' [[reconstruction algorithm|reconstruction]] of an entire 3D volume of tissue to diagnose [[breast cancer]] or [[neonate|neonatal]] [[human brain|brain]] [[haemorrhage]]. The spatial resolution of DOT techniques is several millimeters, comparable to the lower end of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). The temporal resolution of EROS is very good, comparable to [[electroencephalography]], and [[magnetoencephalography]] (~milliseconds), while that of NIRS, which measures hemodynamic changes rather than neuronal activity, is comparable to fMRI (~seconds). DOT instruments are relatively low cost ($150,000), portable and immune to electrical interference. The signal-to-noise ratio of NIRS is quite good, enabling detection of responses to single events in many cases. EROS signals are much weaker, typically requiring averaging of many responses. Important chemicals that this method can detect include [[hemoglobin]] and [[cytochrome]]s. == Ballistic optical imaging == ''Ballistic optical imaging'' systems ignore the diffused photons and rely only on the [[ballistic photon]]s to create high-resolution (near [[diffraction limit]]ed) images through scattering media. == See also == * [[Photon diffusion]] * [[Ballistic imaging]] * [[Photon diffusion equation]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.licor.com/bio/products/imaging_systems/pearl/pearl_sensitivity.jsp/ Understanding Near-Infrared Imaging] &ndash; Resource to better understand the benefits of Near-Infrared imaging. * [http://www.lrsm.upenn.edu/pmi Diffuse Optics Lab at University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia] * [http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/research/technologiesDOI.php DOI at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston] * [http://www-nml.dartmouth.edu/biomedprg/biomed.html Biomedical Imaging Group at Dartmouth] * [http://dosi.bli.uci.edu DOS/I Lab at the Beckman Laser Institute, University of California, Irvine] * [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0031-9155/50/4/R01 A review article in the field by A.P.

The method is largely due to the work of [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his collaborators in the Soviet Union<ref>L. S. [[Pontryagin]], 1962. ''The Mathematical Theory of Optimal Processes''.</ref> and [[Richard Bellman]] in the United States. ==General method== Optimal control deals with the problem of finding a control law for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is achieved. A control problem includes a [[cost functional]] that is a function of state and control variables. An '''optimal control''' is a set of differential equations describing the paths of the control variables that minimize the cost functional. The optimal control can be derived using [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]] (a [[necessary condition]]), or by solving the [[Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation]] (a [[sufficient condition]]). We begin with a simple example. Consider a car traveling on a straight line through a hilly road. The question is, how should the driver press the accelerator pedal in order to ''minimize'' the total traveling time? Clearly in this example, the term control law refers specifically to the way in which the driver presses the accelerator and shifts the gears. The "system" consists of both the car and the road, and the optimality criterion is the minimization of the total traveling time. Control problems usually include ancillary [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. For example the amount of available fuel might be limited, the accelerator pedal cannot be pushed through the floor of the car, speed limits, etc. A proper cost functional is a mathematical expression giving the traveling time as a function of the speed, geometrical considerations, and initial conditions of the system. It is often the case that the constraints are interchangeable with the cost functional. Another optimal control problem is to find the way to drive the car so as to minimize its fuel consumption, given that it must complete a given course in a time not exceeding some amount. Yet another control problem is to minimize the total monetary cost of completing the trip, given assumed monetary prices for time and fuel. A more abstract framework goes as follows. Minimize the continuous-time cost functional :<math>J=\Phi(\textbf{x}(t_0),t_0,\textbf{x}(t_f),t_f) + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \mathcal{L}(\textbf{x}(t),\textbf{u}(t),t) \,\operatorname{d}t</math> subject to the first-order dynamic constraints :<math> \dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \textbf{a}(\textbf{x}(t),\textbf{u}(t),t),</math> the algebraic ''path constraints'' :<math> \textbf{b}(\textbf{x}(t),\textbf{u}(t),t) \leq \textbf{0},</math> and the boundary conditions :<math>\boldsymbol{\phi}(\textbf{x}(t_0),t_0,\textbf{x}(t_f),t_f)</math> where <math>\textbf{x}(t)</math> is the ''state'', <math>\textbf{u}(t)</math> is the ''control'', <math>t</math> is the independent variable (generally speaking, time), <math>t_0</math> is the initial time, and <math>t_f</math> is the terminal time. The terms <math>\Phi</math> and <math>\mathcal{L}</math> are called the ''endpoint cost '' and ''[[Lagrangian]]'', respectively. Furthermore, it is noted that the path constraints are in general ''inequality'' constraints and thus may not be active (i.e., equal to zero) at the optimal solution. It is also noted that the optimal control problem as stated above may have multiple solutions (i.e., the solution may not be unique). Thus, it is most often the case that any solution <math>(\textbf{x}^*(t^*),\textbf{u}^*(t^*),t^*)</math> to the optimal control problem is ''locally minimizing''. ==Linear quadratic control== A special case of the general nonlinear optimal control problem given in the previous section is the [[Linear-quadratic regulator|''linear quadratic'' (LQ) optimal control problem]]. The LQ problem is
