This form of computer surveillance, known as [[TEMPEST]], involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/tempest.html|title=Complete, Unofficial Tempest Page|last=McNamara|first=Joel|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref><ref name="emr">{{cite journal | author=Van Eck, Wim | title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk? | journal=Computers & Security | volume=4 | year=1985 | pages=269–286 | url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf | doi=10.1016/0167-4048(85)90046-X }}</ref><ref name=Kuhn2004>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | year = 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}</ref> IBM researchers have also found that, for most computer keyboards, each key emits a slightly different noise when pressed. The differences are individually identifiable under some conditions, and so it's possible to log key strokes without actually requiring logging software to run on the associated computer. And it has also been shown, by [[Adi Shamir]] et al., that even the high frequency [[noise]] emitted by a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] includes information about the instructions being executed. ==See also== * [[Surveillance]] * [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] * [[Total Information Awareness]] * [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]] * [[CIPAV]] * [[ECHELON]] * [[NSA call database]] * [[TEMPEST]] * [[GhostNet]] * [[Cyber spying]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} {{malware}} [[Category:Surveillance]] [[Category:Computer forensics]] [[Category:Computer security]] [[ar:جاسوسية رقمية]] [[de:Online-Durchsuchung]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7598</id> <title>Computerized Speech Lab</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} The '''Computerized Speech Lab''' ('''CSL''') is a speech and [[signal processing]] [[computer workstation]] ([[software]] and [[hardware]]) used for [[research]] and clinical [[speech therapy]]. CSL was developed by STR and Kay Elemetrics Corporation. Their promotional literature claims that "CSL has achieved world-wide recognition for its flexibility, real-time analysis capabilities, ease of use, personalized user support and its broad range of analysis tools". The individual speaks into a microphone, and the output is shown in a graphic formation on the electronic screen. This can help with correcting speech impediments, learning where and how to vocalize certain sounds, and which frequencies in certain sounds are beyond the normal range. A different system, Babel was conceived to be matched with the Kay Elemetrics equipment, but the systems were never combined.

(CV) was an early pioneer in turnkey Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]). Computervision was founded in 1969 by [[Marty Allen (financier)|Marty Allen]] and [[Philippe Villers]], and headquartered in Bedford, [[Massachusetts]], [[USA]]. Its early products were built on a [[Data General Nova]] platform. Starting around 1975, Computervision built its own "CGP" (Computervision Graphics Processor) Nova-compatible 16-bit computers with added instructions optimized for graphics applications and using its own [[operating system]] known as Computervision Graphic Operating System (CGOS). In the 1980s, Computervision transitioned to [[Unix]]. == CADDS Product History == Computervision's first product, CADDS-1, was aimed at the [[printed circuit board]] layout and 2-D [[technical drawing|drafting]] markets. CADDS stood for Computervison Automated Design and Drafting System. [[Integrated circuit]] layout was added with the CADDS-2 product, which had a dedicated operating system and a 16-bit graphic database. When this proved insufficient resolution for [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] (very large scale integration), the company developed CADDS-2/VLSI in the late 1970s. CADDS-2/VLSI included a new operating system, a 32-bit database, and user expandability through a dedicated [[programming language]] called [[ICPL]] (integrated circuit programming language), which was a [[programming language dialect|dialect]] of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], based on an interpreter licensed from Fairchild Semiconductor. The original CADDS-2 ran on [[Data General Nova]] 1200 computers. CADDS-2/VLSI ran on Computervision's own hardware which were modified [[Data General Nova]]'s and modified version of DG's operating systems. CADDS3 was introduced in the late 1970s on the CGP80 and CGP100 using [[Tektronix]] [[storage tube]] vector devices. Usable 3-D design was added in the early 1980s with the CADDS4 product on the CGP200. This version of CADDS moved display technology from [[storage tube]] base displays to [[raster graphics]] and introduced the dedicated graphics co-processor board known as the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU. With CADDS4 Tailored packages were available for CAD drafting, CAM ([[computer-aided manufacturing]]), 3-D modeling, piping and plant design, [[printed circuit]] board layout, instrument panel design, and many other applications. During this period, they also contributed to the development of the [[IGES]] standard for [[CAD/CAM]] data exchange, along with [[Applicon]] and other competitors. The major breakthrough in 3-D Design was with the CADDS4X on the CGP200X running CGOS200X. This version of the operating system and hardware improved memory management (not true virtual memory) and increased program size. In 1984 a cluster of CGP200X with a proprietary 32-bit processor Analytic Processing Unit (APU) was offered as the Computervision Design System (CDS) 4000. The APU was sometimes called "All Paws Up". == [[MEDUSA]] Product History == In 1983 Computervision purchased Cambridge Interactive Systems (CIS), founded by British computer scientist Dr. [[Dick Newell]] and Tom Sancha. Computervision was interested in obtaining some of the state-of-the-art technology of the MEDUSA CAD system the [[Cambridge]] company had developed. CIS had a partnership with [[Prime Computer]] which maintained its option on the MEDUSA source code. At the time, MEDUSA was available on the then newly released 32bit so-called super mini computers, whose most prominent distributors were DEC (VAX) and Prime Computer. In 1984 there was a fork in MEDUSA as Prime took its option to keep developing MEDUSA. This in effect created two different versions of MEDUSA: CIS MEDUSA (owned by Computervision, which ran on Prime and VAX workstations) and Prime MEDUSA (given away for free with the purchase of Prime computers, and which only ran on Prime computers). The two
