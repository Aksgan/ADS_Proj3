The song consists beats from a snare-drum and a saxophone interlude. "Physical attraction" is a medium paced track, with synth bass, a guitar line, sounds of a [[Brass instrument|brass]] and Madonna singing in a shrill voice, about the attraction between herself and a boy.<ref name="rikky13"/> The last song on the album is "Everybody", which starts with a heavily [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] and spoken [[Introduction (music)|introduction]], with Madonna taking a loud intake of [[breathing|breath]].<ref name="rikky15">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=14}}</ref> She displayed her bubblegum-pop like voice in the song, which was also [[Doubletracking|doubletracked]].<ref name="rikky15"/> ==Critical reception== {{Album ratings | rev1 = [[About.com]] | rev1Score = (Positive)<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/discographies/a/madonnadisc.htm|title=Madonna Discography: Annotated list of Madonna's albums|last=Lamb|first=Bill|date=1983-2008|publisher=[[About.com]].

Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] commented that "Madonna's album is state of the art dance-pop loaded with hits from 'Holiday' and 'Lucky Star' to 'Borderline'. Irresistible pop hooks glide across shimmering synth beats to make this a landmark album of the early 80's."<ref name="about"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[Allmusic]] commented that "[Madonna's] eponymous debut isn't simply good, it set the standard for dance-pop for the next 20 years. Why did it do so? [...] Madonna's singing isn't particularly strong; the songs, while hooky and memorable, couldn't necessarily hold up on their own without the production — but taken together, it's utterly irresistible."<ref name="allmusic"/> Tony Power from ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' said that the album consisted of "quacking synths, overperky bass and state-of-the-art mechanical disco, with Madonna strapped to the wing rather than holding the controls. It's a breathless, subtlety-free debut, with overtones of [[Soft Cell]] and [[Tom Tom Club]]."<ref name="blender"/> While reviewing the remastered version of the album, released in 2001, Michael Paoletta from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' felt that "Nearly 20 years after the release of ''Madonna'', such tracks as 'Holiday', 'Physical Attraction', 'Borderline' and 'Lucky Star' remains irresistible."<ref name="bbissue"/> Jim Farber from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album an A, saying "[Madonna] might have wound up just another post-disco dolly if [the songs on the album] didn't announce her ability to fuse club beats with peerless pop."<ref name="ew"/> In July 2008, the magazine ranked the album at number 5 in their list of "Top 100 Best Albums of Past 25 Years.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207337,00.html |title=The New Classics: Music|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> Jonathan Ross from ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' said that "'Borderline' is sweet and 'Holiday' still fizzes with invention and joie de vivre....this quintessentially '80s dance hit also features a barrelhouse piano solo."<ref name="Qreview"/> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A- and said, "In case you bought the con, disco never died — just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy — essence of electro, the D in DOR."<ref name="rc"/> Don Shewey from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was of the opinion that "without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance."<ref name="rs"/> Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant (magazine)|Slant Magazine]] commented" "Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [''Madonna''] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago."<ref name="slant"/> The album also received a number of negative reviews at the time of its release. John Skow of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called her voice sounding as "[[Minnie Mouse]] on helium". Other detractors concurred, suggesting that Madonna was "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957012,00.html|title=Show Business: Madonna Rocks the Land|last=Skow|first=John|date=1985-05-27|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Inc|pages=1|accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Other critics like Barry Walters from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' commented that "She's a [[one-hit wonder]], she'll disappear after a year."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walter|first=Barry|date=April 1998|title=Madonna Just Made Her Most Daring Album in Years...|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=14|issue=4|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=2010-05-15|ref=harv}}</ref> ==Chart performance== [[File:Madonna-luckystar-confessions.jpg|thumb|Madonna performing "Lucky Star" on the [[Confessions Tour]], 2006|alt=A blond woman, wearing a white leotard and white cape, singing on a stage.
