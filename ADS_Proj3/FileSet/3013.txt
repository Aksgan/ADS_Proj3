Whereas the energy spacing between vibrational levels in the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] is constant at <math>h\nu_0</math>, the energy between adjacent levels decreases with increasing <math>v</math> in the Morse oscillator. Mathematically, the spacing of Morse levels is :<math>E(v+1) - E(v) = h\nu_0 - (v+1) (h\nu_0)^2/2D_e\,</math>. This trend matches the anharmonicity found in real molecules.

This failure is due to the ''finite'' number of bound levels in the Morse potential, and some maximum <math>v_m</math> that remains bound. For energies above <math>v_m</math>, all the possible energy levels are allowed and the equation for <math>E(v)</math> is no longer valid.

This is often useful for constructing a single hash index from a pair (or more) of input numbers. In number theory, Morton numbers are useful in proofs, often in examples which map multiple dimensions to one, or vice versa. For example, an infinite 2D grid of integer coordinates can have a single unique Morton number computed for each coordinate, and those Morton numbers give a one-to-one mapping of the infinite 2D coordinates to a 1D coordinate—along the [[Z-order (curve)|Z-order curve]]—proving that the infinite number of integer pairs has the same [[cardinality]] as the integers. == External links == *[http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#InterleaveTableObvious Bits interleaving in C] *[http://www.codexon.com/posts/morton-codes/ python example] [[Category:Hash functions]] [[Category:Number theory]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25122</id> <title>Moshe Bar (investor)</title> <text>{{other persons|Moshe Bar}} '''Moshe Bar''' (born in Jerusalem, Israel in June 1971{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}) is an Israeli technologist, author, investor and entrepreneur.

It is an ill-posed problem as the motion is in three dimensions but the images are a projection of the 3D scene onto a 2D plane. The motion vectors may relate to the whole image (global motion estimation) or specific parts, such as rectangular blocks, arbitrary shaped patches or even per pixel. The motion vectors may be represented by a translational model or many other models that can approximate the motion of a real video camera, such as rotation and translation in all three dimensions and zoom. Closely related to motion estimation is [[optical flow]], where the vectors correspond to the perceived movement of pixels. In motion estimation an exact 1:1 correspondence of pixel positions is not a requirement. Applying the motion vectors to an image to synthesise the transformation to the next image is called [[Motion compensation]]. The combination of motion estimation and motion compensation is a key part of video compression as used by [[MPEG]] 1, 2 and
