code. * Semi-automatic handheld readers: The operator need not swipe, but must at least position the reader near the label * Fix-mount readers for automatic reading: The reading is performed laterally passing the label over the reader. No operator is required, but the position of the code target must coincide with the imaging capability of the reader. * Reader gates for automatic scanning: The position of the code must be just under the gate for short time, enabling the scanner sweep to capture the code target successfully. === Types of technology === The reader types can be distinguished as follows: ==== Pen-type readers ==== Pen-type readers consist of a light source and a [[photodiode]] that are placed next to each other in the tip of a pen or wand.<ref name="denso-wave, handheld illustrations" >{{cite web |title=Handheld barcode scanner technologies, illustrated |url=http://www.denso-wave.com/en/adcd/fundamental/barcode/scanner.html }}</ref> To read a bar code, the tip of the pen moves across the bars in a steady motion. The photodiode measures the intensity of the light reflected back from the light source and generates a waveform that is used to measure the widths of the bars and spaces in the bar code. Dark bars in the bar code absorb light and white spaces reflect light so that the voltage waveform generated by the photo diode is a representation of the bar and space pattern in the bar code. This waveform is decoded by the scanner in a manner similar to the way [[Morse code]] dots and dashes are decoded. ==== Laser scanners==== Laser scanners work the same way as pen type readers except that they use a [[laser]] beam as the light source and typically employ either a reciprocating mirror or a rotating prism to scan the laser beam back and forth across the bar code.<ref name="denso-wave, handheld illustrations" /> As with the pen type reader, a photodiode is used to measure the intensity of the light reflected back from the bar code. In both pen readers and laser scanners, the light emitted by the reader is rapidly varied in brightness with a data pattern and the photodiode receive circuitry is designed to detect only signals with the same [[modulation|modulated]] pattern. ==== CCD readers ==== [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] readers use an array of hundreds of tiny light sensors lined up in a row in the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of sensors lined up in a row, a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a bar code is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself. ==== Camera-based readers ==== Two-dimensional [[machine vision|imaging scanners]] are the fourth and newest type of bar code reader. They use a camera and image processing techniques to decode the bar code. '''Video camera readers''' use small video cameras with the same CCD technology as in a CCD bar code reader except that instead of having a single row of sensors, a video camera has hundreds of rows of sensors arranged in a two dimensional array so that they can generate an image.<ref>[http://katanshi.com/Products.php Katanshi Barcode Reader] ''webcam based barcode reader''.</ref> '''Large field-of-view readers''' use high resolution industrial cameras to capture multiple bar codes simultaneously. All the bar codes appearing in the photo are decoded instantly (ImageID patents [http://www.wikipatents.com/US-Patent-6801245/method-for-automatic-identification-and-data-capture/Page-1 6801245] & [http://www.wikipatents.com/US-Patent-6922208/method-for-automatic-identification-and-data-capture/Page-1 6922208]). There are a number of open source libraries for barcode reading from images. These include the [http://code.google.com/p/zxing/ ZXing] project, which reads one- and two-dimensional barcodes using Android and JavaME, the [http://code.google.com/p/jjil/ JJIL] project, which includes code for reading [[European Article Number | EAN-13]] barcodes from cellphone cameras using [[Java ME]], and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/zbar ZBAR], which reads various one-dimensional barcodes in C. Even web site integration, either by image uploads (e.g. [http://www.ashberg.de/php-barcode/ Folke Ashberg: EAN-13 Image-Scanning] and code creation tools) or by use of plugins (e.g. the [http://barcodepedia.com/ Barcodepedia] uses a flash application and some web cam for querying a database), have been realized options for resolving the given tasks. Finally, there are free closed source libraries including [http://www.freebarcodescanner.com/ Barcode Scanner], which read one- and two-dimensional barcodes on iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android, BlackBerry and Symbian smartphones. ==== Omni-directional barcode scanners ==== Omni-directional scanning uses "series of straight or curved scanning lines of varying directions in the form of a starburst, a [[Lissajous curve|lissajous pattern]], or other multiangle arrangement are projected at the symbol and one or more of them will be able to cross all of the symbol's bars and spaces, no matter what the orientation."<ref name="Palmer, Bar Code Book" >{{cite book |author=Roger C. Palmer |title=The Bar Code Book |ref=Palmer, Bar Code Book }}</ref> Omni-directional scanners almost all use a laser. Unlike the simpler single-line laser scanners, they produce a pattern of beams in varying orientations allowing them to read barcodes presented to it at different angles. Most of them use a single rotating polygonal mirror and an arrangement of several fixed mirrors to generate their complex scan patterns. Omni-directional scanners are most familiar through the horizontal scanners in supermarkets, where packages are slid across a glass or sapphire window. There are a range of different omni-directional units available which can be used for differing scanning applications, ranging from retail type applications with the barcodes read only a few centimetres away from the scanner to industrial conveyor scanning where the unit can be a couple of metres away or more from the code. Omni-directional scanners are also better at reading poorly printed, wrinkled, or even torn barcodes. ====Cell phone cameras==== While cell phone cameras without auto-focus are not ideal for reading some common barcode formats, there are 2D barcodes (such as [[Semacode]]) which are
