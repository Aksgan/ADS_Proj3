He is best known as the founder of the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John's College, U.S.|St. John's College]], at [[Annapolis, Maryland]].<ref>The same program is used at St. John's College's second campus in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] which was founded in 1964.</ref> Buchanan's various projects and writings may be understood as an ambitious program of social and cultural reform based on the insight that many crucial problems arise from the uncritical use of [[symbol]]ism. In this sense, his program was similar to and competed with a number of contemporary movements such as [[Alfred Korzybski|Alfred Korzybski's]] [[General Semantics]], [[Otto Neurath|Otto Neurath's]] "Unity of Science" project, the [[semiotics]] of [[Charles W. Morris|Charles Morris]] and the "orthological" projects of [[Charles Kay Ogden]]. Buchanan collaborated with the latter effort for a number of years. Buchanan's own program, however, differed from these generally [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[positivism (philosophy)|positivist]], or [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] movements by stressing what he saw as the need for reforms in the mathematical symbolism employed in modern [[science]]. Buchanan's first book, published in 1927, stated that science is "the greatest body of uncriticized dogma we have today" and even likened science to the "Black Arts". For the rest of his career, Buchanan pondered ways to mitigate the variety of threats to humanity that he perceived in the unmanaged and unsupervised growth of modern science and technology. ==Life== Buchanan was born in [[Sprague, Washington]] and was raised in [[Jeffersonville, Vermont]]. He received his undergraduate degree from [[Amherst College]] in 1916, majoring in Greek and mathematics. After serving in the Navy during the final year of [[World War I]], he studied philosophy at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes scholar]] between 1919 and 1921. He continued his studies in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] and received his doctorate in 1925. During his undergraduate years, Buchanan became personally close to Amherst's president [[Alexander Meiklejohn]] and was strongly influenced by Meiklejohn's ideas about educational reform. This continuing interest led Buchanan in 1925 to accept a position as Assistant Director of the [[People's Institute]], an affiliate of the [[Cooper Union]] in New York City that was dedicated to [[adult education]] and other forms of cultural enrichment for the city's workers and immigrants. It was there that Buchanan met [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Richard McKeon]], and the three of them conceived an ambitious program for reviving American education and democracy through mass training in the traditional [[liberal arts]] by means of the [[Socratic method]] and the [[Great Books]] curriculum. Buchanan spent the next twenty years struggling to establish an institutional base for this radical vision. Buchanan's initial efforts at the [[People's Institute]] were followed by his establishment of the [[Great Books]] "Virginia Program" at the [[University of Virginia]], where Buchanan was a Professor of Philosophy between 1929 and 1936. He was then invited to the [[University of Chicago]] by its president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] in order to help form a "Committee on Liberal Arts" in association with Buchanan's former [[People's Institute]] associates [[Mortimer Adler|Adler]] and [[Richard McKeon|McKeon]]. However, this effort failed almost immediately due to philosophical differences and academic politics. Fortunately, another opportunity quickly arose in the form of [[St. John's College, U.S.|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], a venerable institution with a heritage that reaches back to the colonial period, but which by 1936 had nevertheless lost its accreditation and was in desperate need of reorganization. In 1937, the trustees invited Buchanan and his associate [[Stringfellow Barr]] to make a fresh start. With Barr as president and Buchanan as dean, the two men reorganized the school that year around the [[Great Books]] "New Program". This radical new curriculum quickly achieved national fame and survives today. It is the achievement for which Buchanan is primarily remembered. Buchanan left [[St. John's College, U.S.|St. John's College]] in 1947 after a successful but disillusioning legal struggle with the U.S. Navy, which had been trying to seize the [[St. John's College, U.S.|St. John's]] campus as part of a plan to enlarge the nearby [[Naval Academy|United States Naval Academy]]. After spending the next two years directing [[Liberal Arts, Inc.]], a failed venture to create a Great Books-based college in Massachusetts, Buchanan's democratic vision for the revival of the [[liberal arts]] turned from the academic to the political arena. Except for a brief period in 1956 and 1957, when he was a visiting lecturer at [[Princeton University]] and also served as chairman of the Religion and Philosophy Departments at [[Fisk University]], he held no more positions in academic institutions. In 1948 Buchanan worked actively in the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] presidential campaign of [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], and for several years afterwards was consultant, trustee, and secretary of the [[Foundation for World Government]]. In 1957 Buchanan accepted an invitation by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] to become a senior fellow at [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]], a liberal political think tank in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. Buchanan remained at the Center for the rest of his career, and one of the projects to which he contributed was the Center's efforts to publicize the work of [[Jacques Ellul]] in the English-speaking world. Buchanan died in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in 1968. He was survived by his widow, the former Miriam Damon Thomas, and their son Douglas. ==Works== Buchanan's first book was ''Possibility'', published in 1927 as part of C. K. Ogden's ''[[The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method]]''. This work was published simultaneously in the same series with [[Mortimer Adler]]'s own first book ''Dialectic'', and each book
