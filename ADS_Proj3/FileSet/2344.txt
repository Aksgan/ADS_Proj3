global carbon cycle that are being used to track the effects of climate change in the oceans. In 2009, the DOE JGI [http://www.jgi.doe.gov/News/news_09_06_29.html announced] several dozen sequencing projects approved for CSP 2010. They include the microbial community inside the desert locust gut, bacteria that taint wine, fungi that can break down [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]], radiation-resistant bacteria, and microbial communities in the Alaskan permafrost, Nevadan hot springs and within earthworm egg capsules. With sequencing capacity of more than a trillion bases generated annually, a full fifth of the genome projects at sequencing centers worldwide are done by the DOE JGI. The DOE JGI makes the high-quality genome sequencing data generated freely available to the greater scientific community through its [http://genome.jgi-psf.org web portal] and on public databases. The DOE JGI also supports programs dedicated to functional and evolutionary genomics related to the organisms and environments being sequenced and the development of computational and bioinformatic tools for data management and mining. One such program is the [[Integrated Microbial Genomes System]] (IMG), which provides a framework for comparative analysis of primarily microbial genomes, though the system also supports eukaryotic genomes and environmental samples. Its goal is to facilitate the visualization and exploration of genomes from a functional and evolutionary perspective. ==External links and sources== * [http://www.jgi.doe.gov Joint Genome Institute] (official) * [http://www.llnl.gov Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory] (official) * [http://www.lbl.gov Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] (official) * [http://www.lanl.gov Los Alamos National Laboratory] (official) {{Geolinks-US-streetscale|37.932047|-122.02225|10}} {{U.S. National Labs}} [[Category:1997 establishments]] [[Category:United States Department of Energy National Laboratories]] [[Category:University of California]] [[Category:Genetics or genomics research institutions]] [[Category:Research institutes in the United States]] [[Category:Research institutes in the San Francisco Bay Area]] [[fr:Joint Genome Institute]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20107</id> <title>Joint Interface Control Officer</title> <text>The '''Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO)''' is the senior multi-tactical data link interface control officer in support of joint [[task force]] operations.

It was initially devised for testing [[printed circuit board]]s using [[boundary scan]] and is still widely used for this application. Today JTAG is also widely used for [[Integrated circuit|IC]] [[debug port]]s. In the embedded processor market, essentially all modern processors support JTAG when they have enough pins. [[Embedded system]]s development relies on [[debugger]]s talking to chips with JTAG to perform operations like [[Stepping (debugging)|single stepping]] and [[breakpoint]]ing. Digital electronics products such as [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] or a [[wireless access point]] generally have no other debug or test interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} ==Overview== JTAG was an industry group formed in 1985 to develop a method to test populated circuit boards after manufacture. At the time, multi-layer boards and non-lead-frame [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s were becoming standard and connections were being made between ICs which were not available to probes. The majority of manufacturing and field faults in circuit boards were due to [[solder]] joints on the boards, imperfections in board connections, or the bonds and bond wires from IC pads to pin lead frames. JTAG was meant to provide a pins-out view from one IC pad to another so all these faults could be discovered. The industry standard finally became an [[IEEE]] standard in [[1990]] as IEEE Std. 1149.1-1990<ref name="ieee1149.1-1990" >Copies of [http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/testtech/1149.1-1990_desc.html IEEE 1149.1-1990] or its 2001 update may be bought from the IEEE.</ref> after many years of initial use. That same year [[Intel]] released the first [[Central processing unit|processor]] with JTAG: the [[80486]] which led to quicker industry adoption by all manufacturers. In [[1994]], a supplement that contains a description of the [[boundary scan description language]] (BSDL) was added. Further refinements regarding the use of all-zeros for EXTEST, separating the use of SAMPLE from PRELOAD and better support for OBSERVE_ONLY cells were made and released in 2001.<ref name="ieee1149.1-2001">[http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/testtech/1149.1-2001_desc.html IEEE 1149.1-2001]</ref> Since 1990, this standard has been adopted by [[electronics]] companies all over the world. Boundary-scan is now mostly synonymous with JTAG, but JTAG has essential uses beyond such manufacturing applications. === Debugging === Although it was originally designed for testing printed circuit board assemblies, today JTAG is also used for accessing sub-blocks of [[integrated circuit]]s, making it an essential mechanism for [[debugging]] [[embedded system]]s which may not support any other debug-capable communications channel. On most systems, JTAG-based debugging is available from the very first instruction after CPU reset, letting it support development of early boot software which runs before
