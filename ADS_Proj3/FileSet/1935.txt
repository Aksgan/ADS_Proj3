Wozniak designed a video teletype that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology, the impetus for "the two Steves" seems to have had another source. In his essay ''From Satori to Silicon Valley'' (published 1986), cultural historian [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]] made the point that the Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast [[counterculture]] and the need to produce print-outs, letter labels, and databases. Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Stevesâ€™ prototype models. In 1975, Wozniak started attending meetings of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. New microcomputers such as the [[Altair 8800]] and the [[IMSAI]] inspired him to build a microprocessor into his video teletype and have a complete computer. At the time the only [[microcomputer]] [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] generally available were the [[United States dollar|US$]]179 [[Intel]] [[Intel 8080|8080]], and the US$170 [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 6800|6800]]. Wozniak preferred the 6800, but both were out of his price range. So he watched, and learned, and designed computers on paper, waiting for the day he could afford a CPU. When [[MOS Technology]] released its US$20 [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] chip in 1976, Wozniak wrote a version of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was designed by the same people who designed the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak's earlier 6800 paper-computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip. Wozniak completed the machine and took it to Homebrew Computer Club meetings to show it off. At the meeting, Wozniak met his old friend Jobs, who was interested in the commercial potential of the small hobby machines. ===The Apple I=== {{Main|Apple I}} [[Image:Apple first logo.png|thumb|150px|The very first Apple Computer logo, drawn by [[Ronald Wayne]], depicts [[Isaac Newton]] under an apple tree.]] [[Image:Apple Computer Logo rainbow.png|thumb|150px|The Apple logo in 1977 created by [[Rob Janoff]] with the rainbow color theme used until 1998.]] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had been friends for some time, having met in 1971, when their mutual friend, [[Bill Fernandez]], introduced 21-year-old Wozniak to 16-year-old Jobs. Jobs managed to interest Wozniak in assembling a machine and selling it. Jobs approached a local computer store, ''The Byte Shop'', who said they would be interested in the machine, but only if it came fully assembled. The owner, Paul Terrell, went further, saying he would order 50 of the machines and pay US $500 each on delivery.<ref name="iCon-p35">{{cite book | title=iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business| last=Young| first=Jeffrey| coauthors=William L. Simon| year=2005| publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]| location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]]| isbn=978-0471720836| page=35}}</ref> Jobs then took the purchase order that he had been given from the Byte Shop to Cramer Electronics, a national electronic parts distributor, and ordered the components he needed to assemble the Apple I Computer. The local credit manager asked Jobs how he was going to pay for the parts and he replied, "I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores for 50 of my computers and the payment terms are [[Cash on delivery|COD]]. If you give me the parts on a net 30 day terms I can build and deliver the computers in that time frame, collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you."<ref>iWoz, Steve Wozniak, ISBN=978-0-7553-1408-9, page 189</ref> With that, the credit manager called Paul Terrell who was attending an IEEE computer conference at Asilomar in Pacific Grove and verified the validity of the purchase order. Amazed at the tenacity of Jobs, Terrell assured the credit manager if the computers showed up in his stores Jobs would be paid and would have more than enough money to pay for the parts order. The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers and delivered to Terrell on time to pay his suppliers and have a tidy profit left over for their celebration and next order. Steve Jobs had found a way to finance his soon-to-be multimillion-dollar company without giving away one share of stock or ownership. The machine had only a few notable features. One was the use of a [[Television|TV]] as the display system, whereas many machines had no display at all. This was not like the displays of later machines, however; text was displayed at a terribly slow 60 characters per second. However, this was still faster than the teletypes used on contemporary machines of that era. The [[Apple I]] also included [[booting|bootstrap]] code on [[Read-only memory|ROM]], which made it easier to start up. Finally, at the insistence of Paul Terrell, Wozniak also designed a cassette interface for loading and saving programs, at the then-rapid pace of 1200 bit/s.
