a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger. Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non-cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound-Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename ''Bloodhound''). Network Monitor 3 is a complete overhaul of the earlier Network Monitor 2.x version. Originally versions of Network Monitor were only available through other Microsoft products, such as [[Systems Management Server]] (SMS). But now the fully featured product with public parsers is available as a free [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=103158&clcid=0x409 download]. == Features == Some key features of Network Monitor 3.4 include the following: *Process tracking *Grouping by network conversation *Support for over 300 public and Microsoft proprietary protocols *Simultaneous capture sessions *Wireless Monitor Mode with supported wireless NICs *Real-time capture and display of frames *Reassembly of fragmented data *Sniffing of [[promiscuous mode]] traffic *Can read [[libpcap]] capture files *API to access capture and parsing engine == External links == * [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=103158&clcid=0x409 Download Network Monitor 3.4] * [http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/netmon/threads Forum Support for Network Monitor 3] * [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933741/en-us MS Support KB Article] * [http://blogs.technet.com/netmon Blog for Network Monitor] * [http://connect.microsoft.com Support for Network Monitor Betas on Microsoft Connect] * [http://www.codeplex.com/NMParsers Latest Parser Updates] * [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=133950 Network Monitor Experts on CodePlex] * [http://www.zdnetasia.com/12-most-recommended-network-monitoring-tools-62202606.htm 12 most Recommended Network Monitoring Tools] [[Category:Microsoft software]] [[Category:Network analyzers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24479</id> <title>Microsoft Point-to-Point Compression</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=August 2009}} {{Expert-subject|Computing|date=February 2009}} '''Microsoft Point-to-Point Compression''' (described in RFC 2118) is a streaming data compression algorithm based on an implementation of [[Lempel–Ziv]] using a sliding window buffer. According to [[Hifn]]'s [http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/hifn-ipr-draft-friend-tls-lzs-compression.txt IP statement], MPPC is patent-encumbered. Where [[V.44]] or [[V.42bis]] operate at layer 1 on the [[OSI model]], MPPC operates on layer 2, giving it a significant advantage in terms of computing resources available to it. The dialup modem's in-built compression (V.44 or V.42bis) can only occur after the data has been serially transmitted to the modem, typically at a maximum rate of 115,200 bit/s. MPPC, as it is controlled by the operating system, can receive as much data as it wishes to compress, before forwarding it on to the modem. The modem's hardware must not delay data too much, while waiting for more to compress in one packet, otherwise an unacceptable [[Lag|latency]] level will result. It also cannot afford to, as this would require both sizable computing resources (on the scale of a modem) as well as significant buffer [[Random access memory|RAM]]. Software compression such as MPPC is free to use the host computer's resources which will typically include a [[CPU]] of several hundred megahertz and several hundred megabytes of RAM; Greater computing power than the modem by several orders of magnitude. This allows it to keep a much larger buffer to work on at any one time, and it processes through a given amount of data much faster. The end result is that where V.44 may achieve a maximum of 4:1 compression (230 kbit/s) but is usually limited to 115.2 kbit/s, MPPC is capable of a maximum of 8:1 compression (460 kbit/s). MPPC also, given the far greater computing power at its disposal, is more effective on data than V.44 and achieves higher compression ratios when 8:1 isn't achievable. == See also == * [[LZ77]] * [[Lempel–Ziv–Stac|LZS]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Modems]] [[Category:Microsoft initiatives]] [[Category:Lossless compression algorithms]] [[ru:MPPC]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24489</id> <title>Microsoft Security Essentials</title> <text>{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2010}} {{Infobox software | name = Microsoft Security Essentials | logo = [[File:Microsoft Security Essentials icon.png|64px]] [[File:Microsoft Security Essentials wordmark.svg|225px]] | screenshot = [[File:Microsoft Security Essentials.png|300px]] | caption = Microsoft Security Essentials version 2.0 | developer = [[Microsoft Corporation]] | released = {{start date and age|2009|09|29|df=yes}} | discontinued = | latest release version = 2.0.657.0 | latest release date = {{Start date and age|2010|12|16|df=yes}}<ref name="mse-dc-download">{{Cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=e1605e70-9649-4a87-8532-33d813687a7f&displayLang=en |title = Download Details: Microsoft Security Essentials |work = Microsoft Download Center |publisher = Microsoft Corporation |date = 16 December 2010 |accessdate = 16 December 2010 }}</ref> | frequently updated = | programming language = | operating system = [[Windows XP]] with [[Windows XP Service Pack 2|Service Pack 2]] ([[IA-32|32-bit]])<br /> [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] (32- and [[x64|64-bit]]) | platform = [[IA-32|Intel x86 32-bit]] and [[x64]] | language = English, Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Slovakian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Ukrainian | size = <!-- -->32-bit: 7.5 MB<br /><!-- -->64-bit: 9.5 MB<ref name="mse-dc-download"/><br /><!-- -->Virus Definitions: 60 MB (almost)<br /><!-- -->NIS definitions: 3.5 MB<ref name="ms-web-kb-updates">{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Definitions/HowToMSE.aspx |title=Install the latest Microsoft Security Essentials definition updates |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2010 }}</ref> | status = Active | genre = [[Antivirus]] | license = [[Freeware]]<ref name="MSE-EULA" /> | website = {{URL|http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials}} }} '''Microsoft Security Essentials''' ('''MSE''') is a free [[Antivirus software|antivirus software product]] created by [[Microsoft]] that provides protection against different types of [[malware]] such as [[computer virus]], [[spyware]], [[rootkit]]s and [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]] for [[Windows XP]] ([[IA-32|x86]]<!--x86 here means IA-32, as mentioned in IA-32 article--><ref name="ms-web-social-final">{{cite web |url=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprosecurity/thread/96f7e420-1ac0-4422-8d5f-ab7d7891e233 |title=Microsoft Security Essentials is now Final |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2009 |last1=Drew |last2=Frisch |first2=Carey |quote=It is available for XP x86, Vista/Windows 7 x86 & x64 }}</ref>), [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows
