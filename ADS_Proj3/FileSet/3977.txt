Or, in the infinite dimensional case, ρ is separable if it can be approximated in the trace norm by states of the above form. == Separability criterion == The problem of deciding whether a state is separable in general is sometimes called '''the separability problem''' in [[quantum information theory]]. It is considered to be a difficult problem. It has been shown to be [[NP-hard]]<ref>Gurvits, L., Classical deterministic complexity of Edmonds’ problem and quantum entanglement, in Proceedings of the 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM Press, New York, 2003.</ref>. Some appreciation for this difficulty can be obtained if one attempts to solve the problem by employing the direct brute force approach, for a fixed dimension. We see that the problem quickly becomes intractable, even for low dimensions. Thus more sophisticated formulations are required. The separability problem is a subject of current research. A ''separability criterion'' is a necessary condition a state must satisfy to be separable. In the low dimensional (''2 X 2'' and ''2 X 3'') cases, the [[Peres-Horodecki criterion]] is actually a necessary and sufficient condition for separability. Other separability criteria include the [[range criterion]] and [[reduction criterion]]. == Characterization via algebraic geometry == Quantum mechanics may be modelled on a [[projective Hilbert space]], and the [[categorical product]] of two such spaces is the [[Segre embedding]]. In the bipartite case, a quantum state is separable if and only if it lies in the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the Segre embedding. == References == <references/> == See also == * [[Entanglement witness]] [[Category:Quantum mechanics]] [[Category:Quantum information science]] [[de:Separabilität (Quantenmechanik)]] [[hu:Szeparálható állapot]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33922</id> <title>Separated sets</title> <text>In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], '''separated sets''' are pairs of [[subset]]s of a given [[topological space]] that are related to each other in a certain way. The notion of when two sets are separated or not is important both to the notion of [[connected space]]s (and their connected components) as well as to the [[separation axiom]]s for topological spaces. Separated sets should not be confused with [[separated space]]s (defined below), which are somewhat related but different. [[Separable space]]s are again a completely different topological concept. == Definitions == There are various ways in which two subsets of a topological space ''X'' can be considered to be separated. *''A'' and ''B'' are '''disjoint''' if their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] is the [[empty set]]. This property has nothing to do with topology as such, but only [[naive set theory|set theory]]; we include it here because it is the weakest in the sequence of different notions. For more on disjointness in general, see: [[disjoint sets]]. *''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated''' in ''X'' if each is disjoint from the other's [[closure (topology)|closure]]. The closures themselves do not have to be disjoint from each other; for example, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s [0,1) and (1,2] are separated in the [[real line]] '''R''', even though the point 1 belongs to both of their closures. More generally in any [[metric space]], two [[open balls]] ''B''<sub>''r''</sub>(''x'') = {''y'':''d''(x,y)<''r''} and ''B''<sub>''s''</sub>(''x'') = {''y'':''d''(x,y)<''s''} are separated whenever ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≥ ''r''+''s''. Note that any two separated sets automatically must be disjoint. *''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by neighbourhoods''' if there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhoods]] ''U'' of ''A'' and ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. (Sometimes you will see the requirement that ''U'' and ''V'' be ''[[open (topology)|open]]'' neighbourhoods, but this makes no difference in the end.) For the example of ''A'' = [0,1) and ''B'' = (1,2], you could take ''U'' = (-1,1) and ''V'' = (1,3). Note that if any two sets are separated by neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated. If ''A'' and ''B'' are open and disjoint, then they must be separated by neighbourhoods; just take ''U'' := ''A'' and ''V'' := ''B''. For this reason, separatedness is often used with closed sets (as in the [[normal separation axiom]]). *''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by closed neighbourhoods''' if there is a [[closed (topology)|closed]] neighbourhood ''U'' of ''A'' and a closed neighbourhood ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. Our examples, [0,1) and (1,2], are ''not'' separated by closed neighbourhoods. You could make either ''U'' or ''V'' closed by including the point 1 in it, but you cannot make them both closed while keeping them disjoint. Note that if any two sets are separated by closed neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated by neighbourhoods. *''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by a function''' if there exists a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the space ''X'' to the real line '''R''' such that ''f''(''A'') = {0} and ''f''(''B'') = {1}. (Sometimes you will see the [[unit interval]] [0,1] used in place of '''R''' in this definition, but it makes no difference in the end.) In our example, [0,1) and (1,2] are not separated by a function, because there is no way to continuously define ''f'' at the point 1. Note that if any two sets are separated by a function, then they are also separated by closed neighbourhoods; the neighbourhoods can be given in terms of the [[preimage]] of ''f'' as ''U'' := ''f''<sup>-1</sup>[-''e'',''e''] and ''V'' := ''f''<sup>-1</sup>[1-''e'',1+''e''], as long as ''e'' is a [[positive number|positive real number]] less than [[half|1/2]]. *''A'' and ''B'' are '''precisely separated by a function''' if there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to '''R''' such that ''f''<sup> -1</sup>(0) = ''A'' and ''f''<sup> -1</sup>(1) = ''B''. (Again, you may also see the unit interval in place of '''R''', and again it makes no difference.) Note that if any two sets are precisely separated by a function, then certainly they are separated by a function. Since {0} and {1} are closed in '''R''', only closed sets are capable of being precisely separated by a function; but just because two sets are closed and separated by a function does not mean that they are automatically precisely separated by a function (even a different function). == Relation to separation axioms and separated spaces == The ''separation axioms'' are various conditions that are sometimes imposed upon topological spaces
