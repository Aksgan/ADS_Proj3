"When someone clicks on 'edit,' it would be interesting if we could say, 'Hi, thank you for editing. We see you're logged in from ''[[The New York Times]]''. Keep in mind that we know that, and it's public information,'" he said. "That might make them stop and think."<ref name="Seeing Corporate Fingerprints"/>--> In practice, Wikipedia is defended from attack by multiple systems and techniques. These include users checking pages and edits (e.g. '[[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]]'s and '[[Help:Recent changes|recent changes]]'), computer programs ('bots') that are carefully designed to try to detect attacks and fix them automatically (or semi-automatically), filters that warn users making undesirable edits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2009-03-23/Abuse_Filter |title=Wikipedia signpost: Abuse Filter is enabled |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref> blocks on the creation of links to particular websites, blocks on edits from particular accounts, IP addresses or address ranges. For heavily attacked pages, particular articles can be ''semi-protected'' so that only well established accounts can edit them,<ref>[[Protection policy#Semi-protection|English Wikipedia's semi-protection policy]]</ref> or for particularly contentious cases, locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia's full protection policy]]</ref> Such locking is applied sparingly, usually for only short periods of time while attacks appear likely to continue. === Coverage of topics === {{See also|Notability in Wikipedia}} [[File:Wikipedia content by subject.png|thumb|right|Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January 2008.<ref name=Kittur2009/>]] Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia. Since it has virtually unlimited disk space it can have far more topics than can be covered by any conventional print encyclopedias.<ref>[[Wikipedia:PAPER]]</ref> It also contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored |title=Wikipedia is not censored |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> It was made clear that this policy is not up for debate, and the policy has sometimes proved controversial. For instance, in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of [[Online petition on Wikipedia Muhammad article|Muhammad's depictions]] in its [[English Wikipedia|English edition]], citing this policy. The presence of politically sensitive materials in Wikipedia had also led the [[Blocking of Wikipedia by the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China to block access]] to parts of the site.<ref name=Taylor>{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idINIndia-32865420080405|title=China allows access to English Wikipedia|work=Reuters|author=Sophie Taylor|date=2008-04-05|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> (See also: [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|IWF block of Wikipedia]]) {{As of|2009|9}}, Wikipedia articles cover about half a million places on Earth. However, research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute has shown that the geographic distribution of articles is highly uneven. Most articles are written about North America, Europe, and East Asia, with very little coverage of large parts of the developing world, including most of Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zerogeography.blogspot.com/2009/11/mapping-geographies-of-wikipedia.html |title=Mapping the Geographies of Wikipedia Content |work=Mark Graham Oxford Internet Institute|publisher=ZeroGeography |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:<ref name=Kittur2009>Kittur, A., Chi, E.

Furthermore, the exact coverage of Wikipedia is under constant review by the editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see also [[deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|deletionism and inclusionism]]).<ref>{{Cite news|title=The battle for Wikipedia's soul |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10789354 |publisher=The Economist|date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3354752/Wikipedia-an-online-encyclopedia-torn-apart.html|title=Wikipedia: an online encyclopedia torn apart |date=2007-11-10|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2010-11-23|location=London|first=Ian|last=Douglas}}</ref> === Quality === Because contributors usually rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry.
